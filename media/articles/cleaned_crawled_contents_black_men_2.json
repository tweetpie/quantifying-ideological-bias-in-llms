      "text": "How the manosphere found its way into the Black community\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I read that YouTube had demonetized a podcast called \"Fresh & Fit,\" meaning that the show could no longer earn ad revenue.\n\nWhile YouTube didn't point to an inciting incident, the podcast had recently come under fire for hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes. During the episode , Fuentes had called women \"baby machines\" and denied the existence of the Holocaust.\n\nUntil then, I hadn't heard of \"Fresh & Fit.\" But once I learned that the hosts were two young Black men, Myron Gaines and Walter Weekes , I wanted to learn more about what they were saying on their show - and how they said it.\n\nThe show is part of the \"manosphere\" : online places where men have conversations for, with and about men. Journalists and scholars generally describe younger white men as the most common audiences for manosphere influencers.\n\nAs a researcher of male-dominated spaces , I wondered: Were Gaines and Weekes specifically trying to target Black male followers? And, if so, how were they pulling this off?\n\nAs I listened to their episodes, I started noticing something interesting - the two hosts regularly used language to appeal to Black men. They spoke in the parlance of social justice movements, but applied it, in a twisted way, to justify misogyny and male superiority.\n\nI study male subcultures such as gaming and the military to see the types of rhetoric and behaviors that get rewarded and which kinds of topics are avoided.\n\nThere's the widespread belief that men don't express their feelings well or have a hard time being vulnerable.\n\nThe manosphere purports to upend that notion . On podcasts, YouTube series and discussion boards, men get into the weeds about their lives, their relationships and the challenges they face.\n\nSome have argued that these interviews, posts and threads can be healthy and productive . But the manosphere generally evokes controversial internet personalities such as Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson , who have become notorious for their misogynistic and homophobic tirades. Tate doesn't just say outrageous stuff - he's been charged with sex trafficking and is awaiting trial in Romania.\n\nTo Tate and Peterson, being a better man isn't about learning to be more vulnerable. Instead, they argue that straight men have become marginalized in a society that's gotten too soft, too effeminate and too politically correct. In their view, men need to embrace their traditional roles as protectors, providers and producers.\n\nResearch has shown that young men in particular are receptive to these ideas . Of course, young Black men make up some of this cohort. But they rarely get mentioned in critiques of the manosphere.\n\n\"Fresh & Fit\" bills itself as a discussion on men's fitness, fashion and mental health.\n\nGaines is author of the book \" Why Women Deserve Less ,\" in which he writes, \"Women are benefiting unfairly at nearly every man's expense.\"\n\nWeekes is a business mogul who firmly believes in meritocracy; he credits his success to his own hard work, a point he eagerly reiterates on a number of episodes.\n\nThe show normally involves commentary from the hosts about current events, and they'll often feature guests ranging from CrossFit coaches and gym owners to more controversial interviewees like Fuentes and conservative political commentator Candace Owens .\n\nThe YouTube shows are wildly popular, with some episodes garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nThere's also a spinoff, \"Fresh & Fit After Hours,\" which tends to include panels of young women. During these conversations, the women - who usually work in fields such as modeling, sex work or professional dance - often find themselves put on the spot by the hosts, who ask them to speak on behalf of all women.\n\nI listened to 40 randomly selected episodes of the main show and 25 of the \"After Hours\" show, and the conversations veered into explorations of gender differences and debates about why men are better than women. All of these elements fall under what sociolinguist Scott Kiesling calls \"masculine linguistic practices\" - the ways in which men express their masculinity in conversation with one another.\n\nEach episode is replete with misogyny. On one, Gaines encourages listeners to not go to Miami - not because it's too expensive or it's too hot, but because the women in South Beach think they're \"better than you.\" On another, when talking about what men are looking for in a partner, he notes, \"When we look for security in y'all, it's security in making sure the kid is ours. And a woman that has a promiscuous past might continue that trend in the future.\"\n\nGaines and Weekes do give a platform to women - but it's to women who echo the hosts' warped theories on gender.\n\nIn several of the \"Fresh & Fit After Hours\" episodes I watched, the hosts booked female guests who often admitted that they are status-conscious opportunists - that they want to be taken care of, that they expect men to give them gifts, and that they should be treated \"like a lady.\"\n\nIn one episode of \"After Hours,\" when a guest says she wishes men could approach her without being overly flirtatious, Gaines is quick to undermine her: Surely she gets approached by men every day. But are they all flirtatious?\n\nThen he throws out another question: How many of the men she ended up dating hadn't flirted with her?\n\nShe holds up her hand in the shape of a zero.\n\nWatching \"Fresh & Fit\" also showed me how the hosts sought to specifically appeal to Black viewers and listeners.\n\nI think it's important to note that although Black men are highly susceptible to being seen as a collective group, they aren't a monolith. Many Black men hold conservative views . Instances of homophobia, misogyny and transphobia are as common among Black Americans as they are among white Americans.\n\nIn other words, there isn't any sort of cultural insulation that would protect Black men from negative messages in the manosphere, and the hosts subtly use language and imagery common to Black culture to inculcate Black listeners to their views.\n\nGaines and Weekes invariably slip in and out of African American Vernacular English, which conveys not only authenticity but also forges a connection with Black listeners .\n\nAdditionally, a common theme is the degree to which men are being \"kept down.\" In the context of their show, \"kept down\" refers to the ways in which women constrain them. But in Black culture, the phrase is commonly used to talk about the ways in which the dominant white culture forces them to behave or act a certain way .\n\nCriminal law scholar Paul Butler refers to the impact of those stereotypes about Black men as \" black male exceptionalism .\"\n\nTo Butler, commonly repeated statistics about Black men - their higher incarceration rates, worse education outcomes and lower employment rates - reinforce the idea of Black men as an \" endangered species .\" My upcoming research expands on this, exploring how the internalization of this exceptionalism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe darker corners of the manosphere stoke beliefs about disenfranchisement and discrimination against men. So it's worth pointing out that these messages can easily resonate among minority men, too.\n\nIf they listen to Gaines and Weekes, they'll come away from the episodes thinking that it isn't just racism keeping them down: It's women, too.\n\nSteven Dashiell , Assistant Research Professor, Morgan State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Toxic Masculinity Has Plagued Black Men Deeply, Down to the Details of What They Wear\n\nThe latest fashion trend, the romper for men-or as it's affectionately called, the \"romphim\"-has received mixed feedback on social media. Many find fashion flashbacks like this strange, but within a man's choice to wear. But for others, romphims serve as a reminder of the increasing feminization of male fashion, a view particularly common among black men. As expected, social media wasted no time creating memes bashing men for this fashion statement. It wasn't long before social media statuses shaming women for accepting the trend followed.\n\n\"When I saw the memes about the 'romphim,' I knew there was a storm of toxicity and hate brewing. It's sad how these things are to be expected,\" said Sylvester James, a black man who has received anti-gay, hypermasculine comments on his Facebook feed.\n\nHere are just a few of the anti-romper posts:\n\nAt the extremes of the romphim meme backlash were some who called all men who wore them \"gay.\" Many aren't aware, however, that these comments reinforce the \" man box ,\" the societal standard of what is appropriate for men to do, which limits black male identity development and can negatively affect their mental health.\n\n\"Homophobia and toxic masculinity, especially in our community, affect heterosexual men more than most people will give it credit for,\" said James. \"We are taught from an early age that men are supposed to behave this way, that we don't cry, that emotions are a sign of weakness, and of course that being 'gay' is something to be ashamed of and condemned.\"\n\nPrevious studies have shown black males are under immense pressure to present themselves as hypermasculine. Men who make the decision to resist this pressure are often ridiculed. According to one study , manhood and masculinity are often associated with \"pursuing women sexually and being physically strong and aggressive.\" According to the study, being gay was a threat to masculinity. Participants reported life community experiences viewed being gay as a forfeiture of manhood. As a result, the term \"gay\" is used as a term to police the actions of men who dare to break out of the boundaries of the highly restrictive man box. Trends of anti-gay culture can be seen in \" no-homo \" references made by hip hop artists.\n\nReferring to men as gay in a derogatory way is not only offensive to gay men, but in a sweeping statement also assigns a negative association with anything feminine. This insult offends all parties involved by \"checking\" males who step out of appropriate social boundaries, disrespecting the LGBT community and reinforcing concepts of female inferiority.\n\nAny action that exists outside of the established acceptable norms for men results in their being ridiculed as being less of a man. Examples that commonly fall out of the man box include showing any emotion other than anger, wearing feminine clothes and being affectionate with other men. Aggression, promiscuity and apathy are seen as normal male behavior and within black gender role expectations.\n\nBlack males face pressure to fit into acceptable forms of masculinity. The resulting mental stress black males can experience when they are unable to meet internalized or external gender role expectations is referred to as gender role conflict , a psychological state in which restrictive definitions of masculinity limit men's well-being and potential.\n\nKeenan White describes this phenomenon when expressing his experiences with identity policing: \"As a black male, there is an expectation for us to be the epitome of masculinity. Living up to that expectation is not only challenging, but it's also destructive. If we don't present ourselves as aggressive or violent, we are seen as less desirable.\"\n\nWomen's expectations don't ease the pressure of toxic masculinity for black males; they often reinforce it.\n\n\"Many women expect a man who behaves like a bad boy but still [is] emotionally available and family-oriented. Black men who show concern for women's well-being are portrayed as 'thirsty,' and black males who are upfront and direct about [their] expectations are portrayed as overly emotional or 'in their feelings,'\" White continued.\n\n\"The black community holds strict rules for how a man should dress or act... if a man decides to flat-iron his beard or follow the trend of wearing skinny jeans or rompers, he is often instantly characterized as being too feminine. In my opinion, when we put social norms on any individual it limits their freedom to self-expression, which could lead to not being accepted for who they are. The idea of not being accepted based on how one dresses or acts can cause low self-esteem, depression or putting on a mask [to hide] their real selves,\" said Taneka Jackson, a school counselor.\n\nSocietal norms of masculinity push an image of the \" ideal man \" as being tough, in control and a provider. These norms also limit attempts to get help.\n\n\"Growing up, I idolized a persona that wasn't reflective of who I was. I wanted to be seen as attractive, even if those qualities weren't true to who I am,\" said White.\n\nLuckily, films like the Oscar-winning Moonlight have provided insight into the struggles of black male identity and the stringent boxes they are forced into. Throughout the film, viewers watch as the main character, Chiron, passes through various stages of life trying his best to present himself as an \"authentic black male.\" His journey of identity development includes sexual exploration and defining what black manhood looks like for him. The movie highlights that the executors of violence are also victims of the system, and uniquely sheds light on an angle rarely shown in cinema.\n\nThe pressure to portray a hypermasculine image weighs tough on black males, but the stigma attached to mental health resources in the black community limits their access to assistance to remedy the hypermasculinization.\n\nResearch shows discrimination and gender stereotyping lead to worse health outcomes, particularly mental health, for black men. During a podcast titled \" How masculinity can hurt mental health ,\" psychologist Wizdom Powell, an associate professor in the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill's Department of Health Behavior, addressed the rules of masculinity and societal factors that affect the health of men of color.\n\nMen who adhere to traditional rules of masculinity have higher rates of depressive symptoms, according to Powell. Additionally, men who are low on the social ladder are more likely to use aggression as a way to cope with the pain of oppression. Through the podcast, Powell stresses the importance of context-black males are not inherently distrusting; rather, navigating their way through a historically oppressive system has made them that way.\n\n\"When men adhere rigidly to the kinds of norms that encourage them to not share their emotions, to be sort of relentlessly self-reliant without seeking the help or support of others, they can have poorer mental health outcomes,\" Powell said. He added that these men also find themselves cut off \"from the social networks and social supports that might help them get through a difficult time.\"\n\nWhile all men are exposed to the restraints of masculinity, black men have increased pressure. \"The norms around masculinity also vary by race and social location. So it depends on where you sit on the social ladder, how you enact those particular brands of masculinity,\" said Powell.\n\nBlack Americans are estimated to be 20 percent more likely to suffer from mental illness than the rest of the population, according to the Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. It is evident that systemic disadvantages and social pressure take a toll on black men's mental health, as the suicide rate for black males has shown a significant increase in recent years. Last year, music artist Kid Cudi made headlines for checking himself into a treatment facility to treat his suicidal urges, sparking an important conversation about black males and mental health. Shedding light on the mental health struggles of black men is of utmost importance, but what would tackle the problem more effectively, is spending more time as a community examining how ridiculous expectations cause men distress.\n\n\"We aren't taught how to express our feelings in a healthy way, how to cope with our emotions, or how to be accepting and loving of ourselves, let alone people who are different from us,\" said James.\n\nThe insults hurled at black men who desire to participate in the romphim trend might seem solely disapproval for their fashion choice; however, it is reflective of much more. The reactions we have witnessed represent an additional level of social barriers to healthy black male identity development. It is directly related to their inability to connect emotionally with those around them and discourages them to seek mental health services. Until we lift these weights off the shoulders of black men, our community will continue to suffer. So by all means, let the man wear a romper and let that be that."

      "text": "Black Men Are Welcoming Students Back to Schools with No Black Teachers. What's Wrong With This Picture?\n\nA new tradition has started at schools in cities like Atlanta, Hartford and Boston. Black men from the community, dressed in suits and other professional attire, stand outside the school doors to welcome students to the start of another year. Just like the starting lineup line at a game, where teammates receive players with high-fives, the men form an aisle for students to walk down as they approach the school doors. Students are greeted with words of encouragement, slaps on the back and head, or some dap , to signal to kids that school matters. So what could possibly be wrong with this \"it takes a village\" display? When those same kids enter into their schools, they see a teaching force that is predominantly female and white. The doors of the school shut with the Black men outside of the village. What kind of message does that send to kids?\n\nI've come to conclude that these displays meant to encourage and uplift Black and Brown children are disingenuous at best, damaging at worst. That's because the very school and district leaders who are great at getting Black men to show up for Soul Train-style-high-five lines do a piss poor job getting Black and Latino men in the classroom and keeping them there. Data released this summer show just how dire this situation is. Of the 4 million teachers in the US, just 2% are Black men, while another 2% are Latino men. Even when you look at teachers of color in general, the numbers don't get much better. Nationally, just 6.7% of teachers are Black. Even in urban areas where the representation of teachers of color is greatest, the numbers show that enough isn't being done to bring more of them into classrooms.\n\nWhile it's vitally important that students of color see adults who look like them, they need them in the classroom, not just at feel-good, high-profile welcoming events. The research is overwhelming: teachers of color are better for Black and Brown kids. Students of color who have teachers who look like them fare better academically, are more likely to attend college and are much less likely to be subject to harsh discipline. In one study, Black and Latino students preferred teachers who looked like them because Black and Latino educators better understood the challenges that come with being a racial minority. Conversely, evidence suggests that White teachers struggle to understand the role that race plays in their interactions with students of color.\n\nThese \"Calling All Brothers\" events are meant to inspire students of color by showing them role models in their own communities. But having Black men in the classroom is even more important. Black teachers know the world students of color live in; they share experiences and can speak to those experiences in a way that speaks to the spirit of a child striving to thrive in a world that often seems hellbent on killing their spirits.\n\nConsider, for example, what happens to students of color when they enter the school house. Black and Brown students are far more likely to be punished, even criminalized, by White teachers. Black students are three times more likely than white students to be suspended, even when the infractions are the same. And the gap starts when the kids are as young as four . Black students make up just 18% of preschoolers in the US, but account for half of all of the out-of-pre-school suspensions.As one commentator asked in response to the growing body of troubling data: \"what's wrong with White teachers?\"\n\nThe racial disparities in school discipline add another problematic dimension to the new \"tradition\" of making Black men visible on the school grounds even as they're virtually invisible on the other side of the school doors.  Consider the message that sends to children about the role and purpose of men of color in their lives. Black and Brown men are supposed to encourage Black and Brown students to adhere to the rules and regulations of the school, follow the directions of all adults as it pertains to academics and behavior, and step in to keep students in check when they disobey.\n\nPutting men of color on display outside of school to welcome students also sends a misleading message to parents about who is teaching their children, good optics can be confused with real care. Urban school parents may interpret the display as an endorsement of what happens in the school, making it hard for them challenge school leaders if necessary.\n\nI truly appreciate that school reformers who lead schools, many whom are White, are deeply troubled by the educational prospects of Black and Brown students. Clearly, district leaders see the value of Black and Brown men in the lives of their children and the children of their communities. But I am equally troubled by the lack of representation of Black and Latino male teachers in the classroom. If you beg for these men to stand outside your schools and you fail to have these men in your classrooms to teach children who look like them, you are a fraud. Cultural appropriation in the name of educating Black and Brown children isn't identity affirming. It is education without representation."

      "text": "Racial Profiling of Black Men Starts in Preschool\n\nWe know that the shootings of unarmed black men, women, teenagers and children are the violent outcomes of irrational white fear. To paraphrase author Claudia Rankine, \"because white people can't police their imaginations, black people are dying.\" A new study finds the racial stereotypes and discrimination that lead to numerous black-white disparities, from education attainment to police violence and mass incarceration, begin long before adulthood and adolescence. Even the youngest black children-in particular, boys-are overly scrutinized and treated with undue suspicion.\n\nResearchers from the Yale Child Study Center found that implicit bias-the unconscious prejudices and stereotypes that inform our attitudes and interactions with others-affects how teachers treat African-American male students as young as 4 years old. The study, which included 135 pre-K educators, was conducted at a \"large annual conference of early care and education professionals.\" The educators were told that researchers were \"interested in learning about how teachers detect challenging behavior in the classroom.\" Before being shown a series of 30-second video clips, they were provided with a simple set of instructions:\n\n\"The video segments you are about to view are of preschoolers engaging in various activities. Some clips may or may not contain challenging behaviors. Your job is to press the enter key on the external keypad every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge. Please press the keypad as often as needed.\"\n\nThe study subjects were advised that \"sometimes [spotting misbehavior] involves seeing [it] before it becomes problematic.\" The video clips included four children-a black girl, a black boy, a white girl and a white boy-partaking in everyday preschool activities. The one detail subjects were left in the dark about was the fact that \"none of the videos [actually] contained challenging behavior.\" Researchers used eye-tracking software to determine where the teachers, primed to look for potential trouble and troublemakers, fixed their gaze most intently. The intersection of race and gender was a key determinant of where educators looked; they kept their eyes on the black children more than the white children and gave more attention to boys than girls. Out of all four children, the teachers spent the most time studying the black boy for subtle signs of emerging misconduct.\n\nIt's worth noting that these teachers, almost all of whom were female, were both white (66.7 percent) and black (22 percent). The across-the-board hypervigilance of the black boy is proof that to some degree, regardless of our own race, we all internalize the American dominant culture's narrative of black criminality.\n\nWhen directly asked which kid needed the most negative attention to proactively forestall bad behavior, 42 percent of teachers identified the black boy. The numbers dropped off from there, with 34 percent indicating the white boy, 13 percent the white girl and 10 percent the black girl.\n\nIn another study section, early childhood educators were asked to read a short story involving a misbehaving 4-year-old, who they were then advised to pretend was one of their students. Though gender and race were not explicitly mentioned, both were implied by the character's name, given either as Latoya, Emily, DeShawn or Jake. Childish infractions described in the vignette included difficulty napping, speaking loudly or out of turn, taking other students' toys, and hitting classmates or instructors. In select cases, teachers were provided the following information about the imaginary student's home life in an effort to determine whether it might impact their conclusions:\n\n[Child] lives with his/her mother, his/her 8- and 6-year-old sisters, and his/her 10-month-old baby brother. His/her home life is turbulent, between having a father who has never been a constant figure in his/her life, and a mother who struggles with depression but doesn't have the resources available to seek help. During the rare times when his/her parents are together, loud and sometimes violent disputes occur between them. In order to make ends meet, [child's] mother has taken on three different jobs, and is in a constant state of exhaustion. [Child] and his/her siblings are left in the care of available relatives and neighbors while their mother is at work.\n\nThe teachers were asked to assign a rating of 1 to 5 in three areas: severity of the child's misbehavior; level of educator hopelessness (i.e., \"the degree to which they felt that nothing could be done to improve the behaviors\"); and likelihood the teacher would recommend suspension or expulsion. In cases where either was suggested, they were also asked to state the number of days that would fit the bill. It's here that a curious trend emerged, one that has everything to do with expectations.\n\nWhite teachers viewed the behavior as more severe when the child was depicted as white, but less so when the 4-year-old was imagined to be black. Researchers suggest that this correlates with previously studied racist notions and stereotypes around black behavior. That is, if you already believe that black children, black boys in particular, are more likely to behave poorly (and the scrutiny teachers gave black students suggests that's precisely what they believed) you'll probably find their misbehavior less surprising, disappointing or problematic than with white students, from whom you expect better.\n\nConversely, black teachers saw black students' misbehavior as more severe than their white cohorts. Researchers suspect they unconsciously held black students to higher standards than participating white teachers did, and regarded black student misbehavior as a greater concern than for white students. This, the researchers note, was consistent with previous studies cited.\n\nIn contrast with previous scholarship, which found that \"Black students are rated as less disruptive and are suspended less often when they are rated by black teachers than when they are rated by other-race teachers,\" black teachers in the Yale study \"recommended expelling or suspending children more days than white participants.\" Study authors connect that surprising finding with theories about black cultural notions of corporal punishment , for example, as a method of toughening up children for encounters with racism, discrimination, and other forms of anti-black oppression and even violence.\n\nJust as black parents feel the \"need to prepare [black] children for, or protect them from, a harsh world,\" Yale psychologist and study lead Walt Gilliam told the Washington Post , \"[i]t seems possible that the black preschool teachers may be operating under similar beliefs... that black children require harsh assessment and discipline.\"\n\nThere was another fascinating aspect of the study. In cases where teachers were given background information on the naughty child, their level of empathy increased only when teacher and student were of the same race. When the student and teacher were of differing races, the teachers actually viewed the child's behavior as worse when they learned of her or his troubled home life. Empathy, it seems, has difficulty crossing racial boundaries.\n\nAll of this is massively important. Numerous studies show that students who are suspended or expelled are more likely to do poorly in school, to drop out before graduation, and to enter the criminal justice system. That's the school-to-prison pipeline in a nutshell, and the Yale study suggests teacher biases begin propelling black boys along the carceral route at a startlingly young age. The Yale psychologists open their report by pointing to investigations showing black preschool-age children are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than white preschoolers. Though black kids make up just 19 percent of all pre-K students in this country, they are 47 percent of those who are suspended at least once, though frequently more often.\n\nThe teachers who participated in the Yale study are not unique in their implicit biases against black kids. Their deeply held attitudes are actually closely in keeping with what we already know about the pervasiveness of racism and implicit bias, and the devastating impact both have on the lives of black children in this country. Previous studies have found that black children are seen as older and less innocent by many white Americans; that they are more likely to be placed in correctional facilities even when they commit less crime than white teens; that they are more likely to be tried as adults than white youngsters; and that they face longer sentences for the same crimes young white offenders commit. Gilliam rightly states the study is more evidence that anti-black racism is inextricable from black lives and American institutions, and that it poisons every aspect of the black American experience and outcomes.\n\n\"Implicit biases do not begin with black men and police. They begin with black preschoolers and their teachers, if not earlier,\" Gilliam told the Washington Post . \"Implicit bias is like the wind: You can't see it, but you can sure see its effects.\""

      "text": "Are Whites Really Physically Afraid of Black Men?\n\nThe furor surrounding the shooting of young Trayvon Martin has refueled an American dialogue that is older than the nation itself, centering on the idea that whites are afraid of black people, especially black men. From unspoken visceral reactions to violent encounters, fear is said to drive typical white responses to a black presence. Chauncey DeVega has made some cogent points on the topic (\" Face It: Trayvon Martin is Dead Because Many White People Are Afraid of Black People \"). But is fear really the whole story? And who really has reason to be afraid?\n\nI believe what some define as a \"fear\" many white Americans harbor is more properly defined as disrespect. From the days of Nixon's euphemistic calls for \"law and order\" to the Willie Horton campaign ads, right-wing politicians have long exploited an inherent societal disrespect for black folks that is hidden under the false curtain of fear. A supposed fear of black men is a convenient pretense for abuse of everything from racial privilege to police power.\n\nWhat often goes unmentioned, especially in mass media, is the hesitance with which millions of black Americans navigate daily interaction with whites -- a hesitance driven not by fear, but by the assumption of our powerlessness and our invisibility. You can bet that blacks are more afraid of white men in hoods, than whites are of black men in hoods.\n\nHistory, along with personal and anecdotal evidence, illustrates that whites do not necessarily physically fear black folk, or more particularly, black males. From the colonial 1620s, through the 1960s, those white Americans who could afford African slaves, or later, domestic help, trusted their staff to bathe, clothe, tutor, and nurse their infants and children, prepare family meals, and tend to their livestock. Would you hire household help who are inclined to abuse your babies, sexually molest your daughters, or spit in your stew? Black men have served as stable grooms, valets, butlers, waiters, Pullman Porters and cooks for private schools, families, upscale hotels and resorts, and passenger trains on which they waited on male and female sleepover passengers.\n\nIf physical fear was the simple answer, blacks would not have so many \"It happened to you too?\" dinner party conversations recounting invasive white social workers of both genders, brassy insurance salespersons, and other door-to-door activity in inner-city apartments where our lives are invaded by whites who seem perfectly comfortable just barging in. We would not share so many stories of being asked inappropriate or insulting questions by whites without the slightest remorse or reservation.\n\nMy parents live in a college community in Washington, DC. Since the 1980s, when public decorum near the campus began to erode, students have strolled across their lawn on the way home from pubs or parties, littered in their front yard, and knocked down their lawn's stone bordering wall in a vehicle. In the late '80s when there was a theater near my folks' home that hosted a few punk rock events, kids used to sit in their neighbor's front yard for hours after the concerts. None of these inconsiderations demonstrate a fear of black people, though they all speak to a disrespect for personal property and communities. So the integration-era phrase, \"There goes the neighborhood\" works both ways.\n\nI have had white strangers ask me things, often crowding my personal space and loudly interrupting a conversation, in a way that hardly suggests physical intimidation. I've also heard racial slurs from whites that no cowering individual would dare utter. Even since the 1980s, I have seen both patrons and personnel in service industries disrespect my mother when whites have butted in front of her in lines waiting to be served. The pattern is always the same -- the bystanding customers rally to the defense of both the rude patron and the mistaken customer service person in a manner I doubt would occur if these self-appointed defenders imagined my mom had a shank in her handbag.\n\nIf whites simply feared blacks, or black men, a minority of Brits, Dutch, Portuguese, Belgians, or French, respectively, would never have been able to colonize and perform missionary work in the nations of Africa and the Caribbean. And where was this legendary, King Kong-metaphor, Birth of a Nation -style fear when those bigoted terrorists in Money, Mississippi found the black community Emmit Till was visiting during the summer of 1955, entered his grandfather's home, and demanded Till's relatives wake the sleeping teenager and deliver him? In the dead of night, surrounded by negroes (switchblade toting? violence prone?), did these whites fear for their lives? Till's older relatives told the men where the boy slept, and the child was dragged out of bed. Wasn't the fear actually on the other foot?\n\nTrayvon Martin of Sanford, Fla., was a victim of dehumanization more than fear. Since most blacks arrived on American shores to fulfill roles of servitude, brown skin has carried with it the veneer of inequality. The stereotyping of black males as dangerous \"others\" has not been borne out in their comportment even when they gather en masse, as they did during the 1963 March on Washington and 1995's Million Man March. In the earlier example, all Washington, DC liquor stores were closed as a precaution. In the more recent case, law enforcement surveillance by air and land were the order of the day. Yet not a flea was harmed on either day.\n\nEveryone has different fears and red flags, but in general, it is the oppressed or objectified groups that fear their oppressor more than the reverse. I recall vividly how a female colleague explained to me how physically intimidated women feel in not knowing which sidewalk cat callers and other verbal harassers will prove violent or threatening. The sense of the possibility of physical harassment is something that women carry with them in public situations as a matter of course. Catcalls are not experienced as \"compliments\" when the person making them brings an attitude of disrespect.\n\nThose twin demons, disrespect and dehumanization, are both highly prevalent in Western racial psyche. When U.S. Representative Joe Wilson yelled \"You lie,\" interrupting President Obama during a joint session of Congress in September 2009, he was motivated by a disrespect rarely associated with the presidency in such circumstances, not by fear.\n\nTwo months earlier, when jet-lagged Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates was arrested outside his Cambridge, Mass. home by Sergeant James Crowley, Crowley had nothing to fear from Gates. But Gates had plenty to fear from the armed and duly sworn Crowley. Black Americans, even those who are 6-foot-tall teenagers, own no tanks, atomic bombs, and govern no prisons, police forces armies, reserves, or chemical weaponry with which to affect a hostile takeover of the American government, even one snatched purse at a time.\n\nFrom the 1931 Scottsboro Boys case to more recent lies perpetrated by child murderer Susan Smith and 2008 McCain volunteer Ashley Todd, who falsely reported a mugging , much of the paranoia about predatory black males has been unfounded. The old \"black man attacked me\" ruse has triggered many a community sweep. From the 1900s through the 1940s, entire American cities have exploded into race riots based on similar rumors. But you'd be hard-pressed to find examples of major American urban uprisings that were actually instigated by angry black males.\n\nFrom the 1920s through the 1970s, when migration patterns changed the racial face of urban America, black males from Boston to Oakland were traditionally harassed, asked to display draft cards and other form of identification, and often tossed on police squad car hoods and frisked by occupying police forces who didn't display timidity. In those days, a pocket knife, much less a handgun, had a very short shelf life in the black community. It wasn't simply fear that drove what the Black Panther Party likened to Gestapo tactics.\n\nIn the 1980s, fear of rampaging, \" wilding \" black males was hyped in the media. Stories of open-air crack cocaine merchants armed with illegal assault weapons flooded the airwaves. You would think that at any moment, young black males would turn these weapons on whites in some Malcolm X film -influenced, gangsta rap-inspired retaliation for slavery and Jim Crow. But if anything, it was the black middle-aged and senior residents of those communities who feared those heavily armed boys, and hunkered in their homes, nostalgic for the days when neighbor admonished neighbor, including other people's children. These citizens sometimes shirked community watch opportunities and volunteer neighborhood foot patrols in favor of their own safety. Rather than shoot the offending and intimidating youngsters in an ultimate act of dehumanization, those elders peeked through their curtains and longed for the times when young men treated them with respect.\n\nIf whites were as afraid of black men as we are asked to believe, then I would not, as a longtime commuter, have witnessed so many white subway passengers who have bumped, brushed past without apology, or opened their newspapers directly in the faces of black fellow riders. The truth is that in such situations, most black Americans are simply too invisible to fear, as innocuous and inconsequential as they were on early episodes of \"Mad Men.\" A harmless ethnic blur.\n\nWhites have little historic reason to fear the repercussions of rudeness, or even violent attacks on black men. The terrorist night riding, paddy rolling, and senseless police murders have been committed on the other side of the ledger. The Yusuf Hawkins, Rodney Kings, Amadou  Diallos, Jena 6s, Sean Bells, and Trayvon Martins are black. The media and law enforcement would do well to be more attentive to a justified trepidation black Americans feel around some whites. This eggshell walk is evident every day in retail establishments, body language, excessive politeness, and even nightly travel routes.\n\nMythical monstrous black men have provided convenient scapegoats and false leads for criminal culprits and dirty cops. But black men experience a profound lack of respect that shapes our attitudes and behavior. Usually it manifests itself nonviolently, and one never knows. Sometimes it is fatal. Trayvon Martin, with his Skittles and iced tea, was not a physical threat. He was viewed as less than human. And now he is dead. Try carrying that thought around when you ride the subway at night."

      "text": "Black Men: Missing?\n\nThe overwhelming absence of black men has always been one of the most distressing facts about life in America's public housing developments. In Chicago, for example, black women are the vast majority of lease holders in the Chicago Housing Authority; men are like ghosts in the projects. Besieged by poverty, disease, violence and mass incarceration, African-American men are conspicuously missing in action. At one time, this gender imbalance afflicted mostly lower-income neighborhoods. But as we limp into the 21st century, that gender gap is rending the fabric of the entire African-American community. \"Where have all the black men gone?\" asked the headline on a story by Jonathan Tilove for The Star Ledger in Newark, N.J. The article examined the New Jersey city of East Orange, where there are 37 percent more adult women than men. Tilove wrote that most of the missing men are dead, and many others are locked up or in the military. \"Worst yet,\" he wrote, \"the gender imbalance in East Orange is not some grotesque anomaly. It's a vivid snapshot of a very troubling reality in black America.\" Tilove noted that nationwide, adult black women outnumber black men by 2 million. With nearly another million black men in prison or the military, the reality in most black communities across the country is an even greater imbalance -- a gap of 2.8 million, or 26 percent, according to Census Bureau figures for 2002. The comparable disparity for whites was 8 percent. In some cities the gap is even higher. There are more than 30 percent more black women than men in Baltimore, New Orleans, Chicago and Cleveland. In New York City the number is 36 percent and in Philadelphia, 37 percent. As the black population ages, the gap widens. \"By the time people reach their 60s in East Orange, there are 47 percent more black women than men,\" Tilove wrote. This growing gender gap has enormously negative implications for the future of black America. And there are nuances in the statistics that make the prognosis even bleaker. For example, among well-educated, professional black women -- a group that is growing rapidly -- the gap is a chasm. Surely, that progress for black women is good news that shouldn't be overlooked. However, as black women advance, black men are falling even further behind. In fact, the more successful a black woman becomes, the more likely she will end up alone, Walter Farrell, a University of North Carolina professor, said in a March 2002 Washington Monthly article. As a result, professional black women are having fewer children, meaning that a growing percentage of black children are being born into less educated, less affluent families. The recent edition of the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education warns that \"a large and growing gender gap in African-American higher education has become a troublesome trend casting a shadow on overall black education progress.\" The Journal reports that in 2001, there were 1,095,000 black women enrolled in institutions of higher education and only 604,000 black men. The gap, which is even wider at professional schools, has increased since 2001. It's also important to note that despite unprecedented gains, black women are the fastest growing group of inmates in the nation's prisons. And they still bear the brunt of urban poverty as single parents in the commercial wastelands that too often are their neighborhoods. Unless we make some dramatic changes in the way our society tracks black men, all of these conditions will worsen, with increasingly nightmarish consequences. The primary culprit is the tracking of black men into a criminal justice system that a growing number of critics have dubbed the \"prison-industrial complex.\" Many are there because of the so-called war on drugs and its accompanying mandatory minimum sentences. The tracking process begins in elementary school, where African-American males routinely are assumed to be academically deficient and then demonized for their angry reactions to those biased assumptions. Resentful of a system that blithely dismisses their potential, many black boys eventually become alienated from scholastic activity. A recent study found that only 38 percent of Chicago's black males have graduated from high school since 1995. These uneducated youth are the raw material of the prison-industrial complex. Lacking marketable skills, they flock to the ruthless underground economy of drug commerce where they are easily siphoned into the \"injustice\" system--victims of the drug war. Some also become victims of lethal gun violence --homicide remains the leading cause of death for young black men. Unless we strenuously intervene to better the prospects of African-American men, who incidentally comprise about one-eighth of the earth's entire population of prison inmates, we may just be accomplices to a process of genocide in our own country."

      "text": "NYT Report: There Are 1.5 Million Missing Black Men in the United States\n\nAccording to a sweeping new New York Times report , one out of every six black men in the United States is missing. 1.5 million black males between the ages of 25 and 54 have disappeared from free society, mostly as a result of death or jail.\n\nWhat makes these numbers even more staggering is the fact that the death rates of young black men have continually dropped since the 1990s. Despite the decrease in homicides, United States prison populations have increased since 1980, the report notes. There has seemingly been an increases in discussions about the racial disparities of our society, as a result of recent high-profile police shootings. The gap of missing people is even wider in the places that have become associated with cop violence recently: North Charleston, where Walter Scott was shot, has a more severe gap than the national average. Ferguson, Missouri has the largest gap, with over 10,000 black men missing. According to a ProPublica analysis , \"The 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks, age 15 to 19, were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million, while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police.\"\n\nThe New York Times puts the conclusions of the report in context, \"There are more missing African-American men nationwide than there are African-American men residing in all of New York City - or more than in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston, Washington and Boston, combined.\"\n\n\"The numbers are jarring,\" Becky Pettit, a sociology professor at UT-Austin, told the Times."

      "text": "The Racial Wealth Divide Holds Back Black Earners at All Levels\n\nIt's no secret that there's a vast divide between the economic fortunes of black and white Americans. A new paper by the Equality of Opportunity Project attempts to shine a new light on just how hard that gap is to close. The study looked at the diverging fortunes of black and white men, and boys in particular. It found that even black men with affluent upbringings often fared worse than white men who grew up poorer.\n\nAs a splashy New York Times headline put it, the \" Sons of Rich Black Families Fare No Better Than Sons of Working Class Whites .\" The paper's coverage noted pointedly that \"broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they're raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\"\n\nThis was a striking finding. But if anything, the study, and the Times report on it, failed to demonstrate the true depth of the problem. That's because, as my colleague Antonio Moore has pointed out, the study conflates income (the amount of money one makes) with wealth (the value of the assets one owns).\n\nAs those who study racial wealth inequality understand, the racial wealth divide occurs at every income level. Whites at the lowest income quintile (earning less than $18,420) have a median wealth of $3,000, while blacks and Latinos have a median wealth of $0, according to the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation.\n\nThis wealth divide carries all the way up to people in the highest income quintile (those making over $104,508 in annual income). In this high-income category, white median wealth is about $444,500, compared to $137,000 and $185,000, respectively, for Latinos and blacks.\n\nAstonishingly, the New York Times and the Equality of Opportunity project report - written by leading researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the U.S. Census Bureau - repeatedly refer to high-income families as \"wealthy.\" But having a high income isn't the same as having a lot of wealth.\n\nThey imply that the black families and white families who see such different economic results in their children came from similar wealth backgrounds. But this is never actually demonstrated.\n\nWhen you factor in racial wealth inequality, you quickly understand why white boys coming from the highest income families are twice as likely to remain high income as black boys coming from the highest income families. Thanks to generations of inequality, as my coauthors and I relayed in a study for the Institute for Policy Studies and Prosperity Now , white households in the highest 20 percent of income earners have 2.4 times the wealth of African American households in the same percentile.\n\nAs research is increasingly showing us, wealth is a much stronger indicator of economic security and stability than income - and almost any other factor. Wealth means assets beyond income alone, which can support families through their ups and downs.\n\nUnfortunately, the Times and the report authors appear to ignore the racial wealth divide and instead dive into other factors that historically are used to explain racial economic inequality, such as marriage rates, the presence of black fathers, etc.\n\nI believe if these researchers had looked more seriously at racial wealth inequality, they would find that lower marriage rates are much more a result of the asset poverty found in the black community than its cause.\n\nThe study and its coverage may also suggest to some that racial economic inequality is driven solely by lower incomes among black men. But this reading leaves out black and Latino women, who also face large gaps when compared to both white men and white women.\n\nInterestingly, as researcher Mariko Chang shows , African American men and women are remarkably equitable in terms of income and wealth when compared to white men and white women, as are Latinos. It is primarily among the most economically well off demographic groups where we see substantive income and wealth differences between men and women.\n\nThere's still much in the 100-plus-page Equality of Opportunity Center report that can contribute to a better understanding of racial economic inequality. But one cannot understand racial inequality without a focus on the racial wealth divide.\n\nBlacks were imported to the United States as wealth for whites. So African Americans have been at the very foundation of wealth development in the United States from the beginning - but they have also been disproportionately excluded from investments in wealth building.\n\nWe as a nation will never get past our long, painful history of racial inequality without bridging that wealth divide."

Nonetheless, Black voters in the U.S. are still predominantly Democratic, making them crucial to that party.\n\nBut in a Washington Post report published on July 31, journalists Colby Itkowitz, Sabrina Rodriguez and Michael Scherer emphasize that Democratic Party strategists fear Black voter turnout will be insufficient in 2024 - especially among Black men.\n\n\"Biden's election in 2020 hinged on narrow victories in states like Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that former President Donald Trump had won in 2016,\" the reporters explain . \"Democratic activists are cautioning that the party can't afford to let support from Black voters slip.\"\n\nOne of the activists who is sounding the alarm is Black Male Voter Project founder J. Mondale Robinson. According to Robinson, Democrats aren't doing nearly enough to fire up voter turnout among African-American men.\n\nRobinson told the Washington Post , \"The Democratic Party has been failing epically at reaching this demographic of Black men - and that's sad to say. Black men are your second-most stable base overwhelmingly, and yet, you can't reach them in a way that makes your work easier.\"\n\nCedric L. Richmond, a senior adviser for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), told the Post that Democrats need to show Black male voters \"why the political process matters and what we have accomplished that benefits them.\"\n\nItkowitz, Rodriguez and Scherer note that Democratic organizers interviewed by the Post are \"less worried about Black women.\"\n\n\"Black voter advocates say the challenge is particularly acute among Black men, many of whom say they feel alienated from the political process and were hurt by policies pushed by both parties that led to increased incarceration and a decline in manufacturing jobs decades ago,\" the journalists report . \"Many say their lives haven't improved regardless of which party was in power, and are dispirited after the country elected Trump, life was upended by a global pandemic and violence worsened in urban areas.\"\n\nThe Washington Post's full report is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "Breitbart Recruited This Black Bernie Sanders Supporter to Convince African Americans to Vote for Trump\n\nA reporter for Breitbart News courted a black Bernie Sanders campaigner to switch allegiances to Donald Trump in 2016 - and then convinced him to work for the right-wing website and encourage his fellow African American voters to sit out the presidential election.\n\nBloomberg News reported Tuesday that Bruce Carter, the founder of Black Men for Bernie, revealed his story to the website after falling out with his former employers when they ceased paying him in the weeks following the 2016 election. At the time, he genuinely believed Trump would rehabilitate urban communities in ways he thought the Democratic Party failed to do.\n\nAfter being recruited by Breitbart reporter Dustin Stockton, Carter told Bloomberg that the message Breitbart hired him to send was simple: \"If you can't stomach Trump, just don't vote for the other people and don't vote at all.\"\n\n\"Trump vastly outperformed the projection models in the 12 areas Bruce was targeting,\" Stockton told Bloomberg, citing areas in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida. \"I never like telling people not to vote. But from a tactical and strategic position, we looked at it: If you could get them to vote for Trump, that was a plus two.\"\n\nCarter founded a group named Trump for Urban Communities that, as Bloomberg noted, \"never disclosed its spending to the Federal Election Commission-a possible violation of election law.\" Carter told the website that at the time, he was under the impression he worked for the Trump campaign and therefore would not have had to report the group's spending.\n\nWith the help of the Breitbart reporter, who has since left the company after being told his work with Carter may have been a \"conflict of interest,\" a Dallas financier named Darren Blanton became one of the group's biggest backers - and eventually moved on to work for the Trump transition.\n\nIn their investigation, Bloomberg found that other people Carter worked and met with while campaigning for Trump also worked with the presidential campaign and transition, and any potential coordination paired with the former Sanders supporter's potential \"in-kind\" work on behalf of Trump may have violated campaign finance law as well.\n\nBloomberg noted that Carter's work for the site and former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon's alleged aims when he hired Cambridge Analytica may have dovetailed in light of a former employee of the data firm telling the Senate that he utilized the company's services to suppress the black vote."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nERIE, Pa. (AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan on Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as she works to energize a key voting bloc that has Democrats concerned about a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nHarris' plan includes providing forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men.\n\nHarris already has said she supports legalizing marijuana and her plan calls for working to ensure that Black men have opportunities to participate as a \"national cannabis industry takes shape.\" She also is calling for better regulating cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nThe vice president's \"opportunity agenda for Black men\" is meant to invigorate African American males at a moment when there are fears some may sit out the election rather than vote for Harris or her opponent, Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe vice president unveiled the plan as she visited Erie, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, for a conversation with Black men from the area.\n\nThe business, opened just five weeks ago, is the project of Ishmael and Allana Trainor, a married couple of Erie natives who returned to their hometown after living for years in Arizona.\n\nLater, Harris held a campaign rally in the northwest Pennsylvania city, where she pilloried Trump for suggesting in a weekend Fox News interview that the U.S. military may need to be deployed to quell an \"enemy from within\" if Election Day is disturbed by agitators.\n\nHer push comes after former President Barack Obama suggested last week that some Black men \"aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign also has been working to increase support among other male voting blocs , including Hispanics, by founding the group \"Hombres con Harris,\" Spanish for \"Men with Harris.\" The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating Black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day .\n\nAs her campaign has done with the \"Hombres\" group, Harris' team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include \"Black Men Huddle Up\" events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond , co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy \"where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of Black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over Black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with Black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans .\n\nHarris' new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks \"with a proven commitment to their communities,\" her campaign says.\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that Black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation's public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey .\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more Black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities.\n\nThe vice president's advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with Black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect Black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas. There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

The candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris has refocused attention on Black men, a demographic that Democrats and Republicans view as persuadable but whose multifaceted experiences and political preferences often go unaddressed in public debate.\n\nHarris' campaign has also reignited discussions amongst Black men about their influence in this election.\n\n\"Black men are the target, and we hold the keys to the kingdom. This is our moment,\" said Lance Robertson, executive director of the Black City Councilmen of Georgia, during the meeting. \"The Black man has built America. Now it's time for the Black man to save America.\"\n\nBlack male voters are traditionally one of the most consistently Democratic leaning demographics in the nation. This year, however, both major parties view Black men, especially those under the age of 40, as attainable voters. Whether Black men turn out in high numbers and to what degree they maintain traditional support for Democratic candidates may prove decisive in November.\n\nAttendees gather and pray during a Black Man Lab meeting to discuss the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\n\"To be frank, I think early on in this process a lot of Black men viewed this election with much skepticism and dread,\" said Bishop Reginald Jackson, who presides over all 534 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia. \"But since the change in the Democratic ticket, there has been a turnaround. I think they feel they have something that they can support. I think a lot of issues which made a lot of them skeptical are being addressed.\"\n\nAt the Black Man Lab event, the men present came from all walks of life. Attendees' ages ranged from 8 to 86, with multiple pairings of fathers, grandfathers and grandsons telling the group about the unique circumstances each generation faces as Black men in America.\n\nBlack voters have historically prioritized policies on civil rights and economic mobility, leading to overwhelming support for Democrats.\n\nBut how those concerns translate into political preferences has shifted as traditional ties to institutions like the Black church have frayed for some younger Black Americans. \"The Black church, in a lot of respects, has been a turnoff for the Black man, and we're only now working to address the need and correct it,\" Jackson said.\n\nMawuli Davis, an attorney and human rights organizer, facilitates a panel discussion on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris during a Black Men Lab meeting, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nFor many younger Black men, advocates stressed, issues like wealth creation, entrepreneurship, police reform and anti-discrimination policies in the workplace are top of mind.\n\n\"We want to see jobs and opportunity for Black men, especially,\" said Andre Greenwood, chair of the YMCA that hosts the Black Man Lab event. Greenwood, who supports Harris, said economic messages will be most important to Black male voters.\n\nHarris' entrance into the presidential race has unleashed a flurry of organizing among her Black male allies. A day after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, a virtual conference tailored for Black men garnered more than 53,000 attendees and raised more than $1.3 million. The event, organized by Win With Black Men, a collective of Black male-led groups, has hosted regular meetings every week since then to engage organizers targeting Black men.\n\n\"Up until this point, these folks were not really engaged with this campaign season, let alone volunteering for outside organizations. I think what we're seeing now is a massive level of organic energy that you can't deny,\" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, a Democratic political action committee that supports Black candidates.\n\nAttendees gather and pray during a Black Man Lab meeting to discuss the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nWin With Black Men said it would direct the raised funds to organizations nationwide for Black male engagement. More than 150 groups have applied for support. James stressed that while the recent fundraising windfall is notable, the Harris campaign's own engagement effort with Black men may not be enough unless it is paired with robustly funded outside groups that have longstanding trust in local communities.\n\nHarris has also revamped her outreach to Black men. The campaign believes it has a winning message for Black men's priorities.\n\n\"It's wealth and it's health,\" Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said of the message.\n\nSeawright leads the Democratic National Committee's \"Chop It Up\" town halls for Black men at barbershops and other venues in battleground states this year. He noted that Black men \"aren't monolithic\" and added that it is a mistake for campaigns to assume \"we only care about criminal justice reform.\"\n\nThe culminating effort also aims to address longstanding skepticism among many Black men about the political system, which is seen as discriminatory and unresponsive to their interests. Others have tackled potential hesitancy among men about electing a woman to the nation's highest office.\n\nRepublicans, too, see an opportunity to make inroads with Black men precisely because of those longstanding frustrations. Donald Trump often speaks of his interest in garnering greater Black voter support. Black Republicans, including Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Wesley Hunt of Texas, have hosted a \"Congress, Cognac, and Cigars\" event series in cities including Atlanta, Philadelphia and Milwaukee.\n\n\"Black men have been taken for granted by the Democratic Party for years, but President Trump's message is resonating at historic levels because he is doing the work,\" said Janiyah Thomas, Black media director for the Trump campaign.\n\nPanelists answer questions during a panel discussion on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris during a Black Men Lab meeting, Monday, July 22, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nMarcus Robinson, a senior spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, called Republican outreach strategy \"hot air, racially charged rhetoric and offensive stereotypes, from questioning Vice President Harris's identity to claiming Black voters should relate to Trump because he is a convicted felon.\"\n\nFor many attendees at the Black Man Lab event, the reinvigorated presidential race is an opportunity to make sure their interests are addressed at the highest levels of government.\n\n\"I was in the street doing wild stuff and this saved my life,\" said Damon Bod, an exterior house technician from Atlanta, of his experience with the Black Man Lab event. Bod said he lost his entire immediate family to violence and that the event provided him counsel and a community.\n\nHe said he would support Harris in the election because the men who supported him felt she would advance Black men's interests.\n\n\"I've been looking at it and hopefully she'll do a bit of good. My brothers have said she will, people who know me. But only God knows,\" Bod said.\n\n____\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Matt Freed)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Barack Obama had frank words for Black men who may be considering sitting out the election.\n\n\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" he said Thursday to Harris-Walz campaign volunteers and officials at a field office in Pittsburgh.\n\nAmerica's first Black president touched a nerve among Democrats worried about Vice President Kamala Harris' chances of becoming the second.\n\nHarris is counting on Black turnout in battleground states such as Pennsylvania in her tight race with Republican Donald Trump, who has focused on energizing men of all races and tried to make inroads with Black men in particular.\n\nObama's comments belie that Black men still overwhelmingly back Harris. But her campaign and allies have worked hard trying to shore up support with this critical group of voters - and addressing questions about potential misogyny.\n\nBlack Americans are the most Democratic-leaning racial demographic in the country, with Black men being outpaced only by Black women in their support for Democrats.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on several major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThere was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nBut Khalil Thompson, co-founder and executive director of Win With Black Men, said he agreed with what he saw as Obama's larger point.\n\n\"I believe President Obama is speaking to a tangible, visceral understanding of what it means for all men to relate to women in America. Calling out misogyny is not wrong,\" said Thompson, whose group raised more than $1.3 million for Harris from 20,000 Black men in the 24 hours after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race in July and made way for Harris.\n\nWin With Black Men has organized weekly calls and events meant to bolster Harris' standing with Black men. The flurry of activism has focused on combating misinformation in Black communities about Harris, as well as an emphasis on the policy priorities of Black men, which the group found are often centered on greater economic opportunities, safe communities, social justice policies and health care, particularly for the partners and children of Black men.\n\n\"We're not a monolith,\" Thompson said. \"However, we are just like every other American in this country who wants a good paying job, that we can provide for our children and participate in their lives and the lives of our partner, that we can get them home safely, afford to go to the grocery store, save a little for retirement and have a vacation.\"\n\nHarris said she believes the votes of Black men must be earned , like with any group of voters.\n\nBlack men \"are not in our back pocket,\" she told a panel hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in September.\n\nHarris recently sat down with the \"All The Smoke\" podcast hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson to discuss her racial identity and policy issues of interest to Black men. On Tuesday, Harris will appear in Detroit for a live conversation with Charlamagne tha God, a prominent Black media personality.\n\nThe Harris campaign is conducting a number of outreach efforts to Black voters, including an tour of homecomings at historically Black colleges and universities, a number of radio and TV ads targeting Black voters in key states, and a get-out-the-vote operation engaging Black communities that complements the work of allied groups such as Win With Black Men.\n\nIt has also tapped high-profile surrogates, including politicians, business leaders, professional athletes and musical artists, to court Black men.\n\n\"Our Black men, we've got to get them out to vote,\" said former NBA star Magic Johnson during a recent Harris rally in Flint, Michigan. \"Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things to the Black community that he did not deliver on. And we've got to make sure we help Black men understand that.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies have held roundtables for Black men and conducted a bus tour through swing states that featured cookouts in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia. The campaign believes the former president's appeals on issues such as the economy, immigration and traditional gender roles resonate with some Black men.\n\nTrump has also sought to exploit Obama's remarks, writing on social media Friday that Obama \"admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men.\" On Saturday, the campaign's Black Men for Trump advisory board released a statement condemning Obama's remarks as \"insulting.\"\n\n\"It's demeaning to suggest that we can't evaluate a candidate's track record - especially when Kamala Harris has done more harm than good to Black communities,\" wrote the group in a letter that was co-signed by Reps. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., Wesley Hunt, R-Tex., as well as former state lawmakers and longtime Trump allies, including former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, whose prison sentence for corruption crimes was commuted by Trump during his administration's final hours.\n\nTrump earlier this year mused that the criminal charges against him in four separate indictments, one of which led to a conviction with another dismissed, made him more relatable to Black people.\n\n\"A lot of people said that's why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against,\" he told a Black conservative audience in South Carolina.\n\nTrump's support among Black, white, and Hispanic male voters worries senior Harris campaign officials as the election increasingly shapes up as divided along gender lines, with Harris stronger with women and Trump stronger with men.\n\nBut the debate over to what degree misogyny plays a role in some Black men not supporting Harris sidesteps a broader conversation on how Black men are engaged as full citizens in politics, argues Philip Agnew, founder of the grassroots political organization Black Men Build.\n\n\"To be a Black man in the United States is to be invisible and hypervisible at the same time, and neither one of those is a humanizing viewpoint,\" Agnew said.\n\nAgnew's group traveled to 10 cities across the summer, hosting roundtables with Black men and making the case for civic engagement and a progressive politics. Agnew said many Black men throughout those conversations expressed exasperation toward politics, a sentiment shared by many Americans, in addition to a feeling that their political perspectives were often misunderstood or unappreciated.\n\n\"The Black men I know are incredibly concerned with the lives of our families and our communities,\" Agnew said. \"It's because of an abundance of love for our sisters that we ask questions, not a lack of love.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020.\n\nLeija's rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump's economic policies, especially tax cuts.\n\n\"I am a blue-collar worker,\" Leija said. \"So, tax breaks for small businesses are ideal for what I do.\"\n\nFor DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats' rhetoric not matching their actions. \"It's been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept their promises to what they're going to do for the minority communities,\" he said.\n\nGallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This year, he said, he thought the former president's \"minority community outreach really showed up.\"\n\nTrump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.\n\nEven as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino voters, it wasn't enough to give the vice president the White House, because of the gains Trump made.\n\nVoters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as well.\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.\n\nJuan Proaño, CEO of LULAC, the nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump's messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos.\n\n\"I think it's important to say that Latinos have a significant impact in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald Trump,\" Proaño said. \"(Latino) men certainly responded to the populist message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues, inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.\"\n\nThe Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump's hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color.\n\n\"I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,\" Harkins said. \"And I think unfortunately, even if it's a very small percentage, you know, when you're talking about an election like we just had it can be very impactful.\"\n\nWhile about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue.\n\nA clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as \"not so good\" or \"poor,\" compared with about half of older Black voters. Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in bad shape.\n\nThat belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These voters simply did not feel that progress.\n\nThis is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he said.\n\n\"Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,\" Uscanga said. \"Gas, grocery shopping even as a college student, everything has gone up in price and that is a big concern for me and other issues like immigration.\"\n\nHaving grown up selling tamales and used cars, and washing cars, Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said.\n\n\"Under the Trump presidency more opportunities were abound,\" Uscanga said. \"I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in 2016 but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019, I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the media was saying and that's why I started supporting him after that.\"\n\nThough the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of white voters.\n\n\"Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing voters,\" said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign.\n\n\"For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing either between parties or in and out of the electorate,\" Woodbury said.\n\nA majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader; slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong leader, up from 37%.\n\nBlack men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe Trump as a strong leader.\n\nDavid Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the election did not disappoint him.\n\n\"I'm satisfied with the result. I don't feel slighted. I wasn't let down. I wasn't pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman in that position,\" he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said, \"I'd rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like Judge Judy.\"\n\n___\n\nFigueroa reported from Austin, Texas.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned Tuesday that Republican Donald Trump would \"institutionalize\" harsh policing tactics that disproportionately affect Black men, while Trump blamed Harris' immigration policies for \"devastating\" Black and Latino communities.\n\n\"Any African American or Hispanic that votes for Kamala ... you've got to have your head examined, because they are really screwing you,\" Trump said of Harris, who is African American, at an evening rally in Georgia.\n\nEarlier, during a radio town hall moderated by Charlamagne tha God, Harris promised to work to decriminalize marijuana, which accounts for arrests that also have a disproportionate impact on Black men. And she acknowledged that racial disparities and bias exist in everyday life for Black people - in home ownership, health care, economic prosperity and even voting.\n\nAP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on Kamala Harris' efforts to reach Black voters.\n\nJust 21 days before the final votes are cast in the 2024 presidential season, Harris and Trump are scrambling to win over Black voters, women and other key constituencies in what looks to be a razor-tight election. Harris, a daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, hopes to maintain her party's traditional advantage with voters of color, while Trump is showing modest signs of momentum among Black men in particular.\n\nA small shift among any group could swing the election.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris poses for a photo as she visits Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nHarris told Charlamagne that despite the persistence of racial bias, no one has a pass to sit out the election.\n\n\"We should never sit back and say, 'OK, I'm not going to vote because everything hasn't been solved,'\" she said. \"This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight. I'm going to win. I'm going to win, but it's tight.\"\n\nThe vice president took questions that listeners called in, but also from a series of people who joined in-studio, including Pastor Solomon Kinloch Jr., pastor of Detroit's Triumph Church.\n\nWhen asked about reparations, or potential government payments to the descendants of enslaved people, Harris said the notion \"has to be studied, there's no question about that.\" It's a position she's taken before, but which Trump's campaign immediately pounced on, saying the vice president was \"open\" to payments that could cost billions.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris visits Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nTrump has called for a return to \"proven crime fighting methods, including stop and frisk.\" The tactic, deployed by the New York City Police Department, involved stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking people deemed \"reasonably suspicious.\" It disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic men, and in 2013 the policy was found to have violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHarris said part of her challenge is that Trump's campaign is \"trying to scare people away because otherwise they know they have nothing to run on. Ask Donald Trump what is his plan for Black America. Ask him.\"\n\nTrump did not respond to Harris' criticism during multiple stops Tuesday, including a Fox News town hall with an all-female audience and a nighttime rally in Atlanta, where he railed against Democrats and the media and focused especially on immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nHe insisted that immigrants are \"devastating\" people of color by taking their jobs. He called President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris' border policies a \"complete and total betrayal of African American communities and Hispanic communities.\"\n\nDuring the town hall the former president sidestepped questions about the erosion of abortion rights, leaning instead into the nation's culture wars by vowing to ban male-born athletes from competing in women's sports.\n\nPressed on how he would enforce a ban, Trump responded: \"You just ban it. President bans. You just don't let it happen.\"\n\nTrump also stood by his recent description of his political opponents as \"the enemy within\" - rhetoric that evokes authoritarian regimes.\n\nEarlier, Harris stopped by a Black-owned art gallery, joined by actors Don Cheadle, Delroy Lindo and Detroit native Cornelius Smith Jr., for a conversation with Black men focused on entrepreneurship.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris arrives at Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nHarris this week announced a series of new proposals dubbed the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" meant to offer Black men more economic advantages - including providing forgivable business loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs and creating more apprenticeships. The plans would also support the study of sickle cell and other diseases more common in Black men.\n\nThe focus on Black men sharpened last week when former President Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and said he wanted to speak \"some truths\" to Black male voters, suggesting some \" just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president .\"\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it doesn't believe Black men will flip in large numbers to supporting Trump, especially after strongly backing Democrat Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, in 2020. They are more concerned about a measurable percentage of Black males opting not to vote at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' support among women has been generally been solid since she took over the top of the Democratic ticket, but Trump is aiming to narrow the margins on Election Day. That could be tough since the former president has seen his support among women, especially in the suburbs of many key swing states, soften since his term in the White House.\n\nA September AP-NORC poll found more than half of registered voters who are women have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, while only about one-third have a favorable view of Trump. To reverse the trend, Trump has sought to cast himself as being able to personally shield women from various threats .\n\n\"You will be protected, and I will be your protector,\" Trump said at a September rally. He's also suggested that, should he win, women will no longer have a reason to think about abortion, after three Supreme Court judges that he appointed helped in 2022 to overturn the landmark ruling.\n\nHarris said Tuesday that it was comical for Trump considered himself a president for women, particularly as maternal mortality is rising and roughly 1 in 3 women live in states with increasingly restrictive abortion bans.\n\n\"And they want to strut around and say this is in the best interest of women and children? And they have been silent on Black maternal mortality?\" she asked.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Matt Freed)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Former President Barack Obama gave a blistering critique of his White House successor Donald Trump and urged Black men to show up for Kamala Harris as he opened a swing-state tour for the Democratic ticket.\n\nAt a campaign field office to thank volunteers, Obama said Thursday he wanted to \"speak some truths\" after hearing reports on the ground that there was lower enthusiasm for Harris than there was for his own candidacy and that some Black men were thinking of sitting out the election.\n\n\"Part of it makes me think - and I'm speaking to men directly - part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said.\n\nThe former president said Trump's penchant for putting people down was not real strength.\n\n\"You're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable,\" Obama said.\n\nTrump responded in a post on his social media network Friday by ignoring Obama's extended denunciation of him, suggesting the former president might secretly have his support, and by once again insulting Harris.\n\n\"Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men,\" he wrote. \"I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn't like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!\"\n\nObama made the battleground state of Pennsylvania the first stop of his campaign tour with less than four weeks until Election Day and as voting is already underway. Speaking at a rally at the University of Pittsburgh, he painted Trump as out-of-touch and not the choice to lead the country to change, calling him a \"bumbling\" billionaire \"who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.\"\n\nHe said Harris is \"a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a chance\" and declared, \"Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.\"\n\nObama, eight years out of power, has been one of the Democratic Party's most reliable surrogates to galvanize voters. Until he was elected president in 2020, Joe Biden had also taken on that role for Democrats, but this year, since ending his reelection campaign and letting Harris ascend to the ticket, he's yet to hit the trail.\n\nObama, who received a roaring welcome from the crowd, described Trump's all-caps posts on social media and his \"ranting and the raving about crazy conspiracy theories. The two-hour speeches, word salad, just - it's like Fidel Castro. Just on and on. Constant attempts to sell you stuff. Who does that?\"\n\nObama listed some of the products Trump has tried to sell during his third White House campaign, including $399 gold sneakers , a $100,000 watch and his \"God Bless the USA\" Bible for $59.99.\n\n\"He wants you to buy the word of God: Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there next to Matthew and Luke,\" Obama said, laughing. \"You could not make this stuff up.\"\n\nThe appearance by Obama, the nation's first Black president, underscores the history-making nature of Harris' own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month.\n\nObama's old campaign rallying cry, \"Yes, We Can,\" was even refashioned for the event, with \"Yes, She Can\" beaming on a screen over the crowd.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump have been vying for support from Black Americans. A recent poll from the  AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black male and female voters on how they view the Democratic candidate.\n\nBlack voters' opinions of Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, according to the poll, but the former president believes his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.\n\nObama acknowledged that the last few years, starting with the pandemic, have been hard for Americans, with high prices and other stresses on working families.\n\n\"I get it, why people are looking to shake things up. I mean, I am the hopey-changey guy. So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,\" Obama said. \"What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHe mocked Trump's answer in the debate that he would replace Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, with \"concepts of a plan,\" and his running mate JD Vance's recent comment that Trump worked to \"salvage\" the law.\n\n\"Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down. And by the way, he couldn't even do that right.\"\n\nObama also referred to a new court filing in the federal election interference case against Trump that said Trump told an aide, \"So what?\" after being told his vice president, Mike Pence, had been rushed to a safe location after a violent crowd of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?\" he asked.\n\nGlenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh, said she is feeling \"a little nervous\" about the election but \"prayerful that it's going to turn out in our favor.\"\n\nEllison said she sees Obama as a party spokesperson with a large following who can hopefully sway voters that might be on the fence about voting for Harris.\n\n\"As a former president, and also as a Black president, I think that is something that might connect with the African American community, the fact that we do have our Black president supporting another Black candidate,\" said Ellison, who is Black.\n\nObama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out of the 2024 race.\n\nObama and Harris have been friends for two decades since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008.\n\nPennsylvania is a state Obama won in his 2008 and 2012 presidential races, but Trump won in 2016. Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and the state is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in this year's race.\n\nTrump was in the eastern part of the state Wednesday for back-to-back rallies in Scranton and Reading. He also campaigned in western Pennsylvania over the weekend when he returned to Butler, where he was shot in July as he survived an assassination attempt.\n\nObama's appearance at the University of Pittsburgh was also aimed to bolster the reelection campaign of Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who is being challenged by Trump-endorsed Republican David McCormick.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct Butler's location to western not eastern Pennsylvania.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Before 19-year-old Davontez Johnson found himself in a preschool classroom at Dorothy I. Heights Elementary, he was a senior at a nearby high school who, like many students his age, was unsure of what he wanted to do with his life. Not in his wildest dreams could he have imagined himself standing on a colorful carpet, leading a gaggle of 4-year-olds in a chant and dance about phonics.\n\n\"Words have parts - that's syl-a-bles,\" he said, enunciating for effect. The preschoolers craned their heads up at Johnson and echoed him. \"Clap your hands now, syl-a-bles! Stomp your feet now, syl-a-bles!\"\n\nPreschool teacher Bridget Jeffreys reads to students, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nJohnson is part of the Leading Men Fellowship, which trains young Black and Latino men to become early literacy instructors in preschool classrooms across the country. It's a program that aims to tackle several problems at once: a shortage of early educators, a dearth of Black and Latino male teachers and the acute challenges boys of color face in schools because of their race and gender.\n\n\"We're not only affecting change in the classroom with these school students, but (we're) also developing these young future educators,\" said Ivan Douglas of the Literacy Lab, which runs the Leading Men Fellowship.\n\nMany fellows, like Johnson, are recruited right out of high school. After an interview process and intensive summer training, they go to work in schools where they may be among the only male educators. Fellows make between $16.50 and $18 an hour.\n\nA former high school offensive lineman, Johnson knows some parents would say he looks out of place in a preschool classroom. And the statistics back him up: Less than 1% of elementary and early education public school teachers are Black men, according to federal data . But that's part of the reason he wanted to do it.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, right, ties preschooler Kodi's shoes, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\n\"I really thought it was a great opportunity. Because I know if I saw someone like me, you know, in pre-K , I'd be pretty excited,\" Johnson said. \"You don't see a lot of young Black males.\"\n\nResearchers have shown that Black male students encounter discrimination before they even set foot in a kindergarten classroom, facing higher rates of expulsion and suspension from preschool even though evidence suggests they do not misbehave more than their white peers. Boys also are far more likely than girls to be expelled.\n\nBut there's a growing body of evidence that Black teachers can make a difference for Black students - and for Black boys in particular. In the years since the Leading Men Fellowship was founded, in 2016, researchers have repeatedly found that students of color seem to fare better when they have teachers who look like them .\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson organizes a writing station during the classroom quiet time after preschoolers return from lunch, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nJohns Hopkins University economist Nicholas Papageorge, who is based not far from Heights Elementary, studies the impact of Black teachers on Black students. His research found that Black teachers have higher expectations for Black students than do non-Black teachers.\n\n\"If a Black student had a white teacher and a Black teacher, that white teacher had systematically lower expectations,\" Papageorge said.\n\nHis later research found Black students who have a Black teacher are less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to attend college. The effect of having a Black teacher had the greatest impact on Black boys from low-income households.\n\nThrough his coursework, Johnson has learned the intricacies of early education - and that it involves a surprising amount of singing and dancing for someone not working on Broadway. Children learn best by repetition, and when they can pair information with movements and song.\n\nPreschool teacher Bridget Jeffreys and Leading Men fellow Davontez Johnson are surrounded by students while distributing playdough for an activity, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBridget Jeffrys, whose preschool classroom hosts Johnson, said she had never worked alongside a male educator until Johnson arrived at the start of the last school year. She said she's watched Johnson grow more confident with her students, going from reserved to enthusiastic. Jeffrys said his voice and dance moves could use some work, but he performs the songs with such heart that it doesn't matter.\n\n\"It was so beautiful because usually you don't see men really get down to the child level,\" Jeffrys said. \"That excited them even more. A lot of kids think he's a big kid.\"\n\nAlong with teaching at Heights Elementary, Johnson is studying political science at University of Maryland Global Campus and hopes to go into politics. His colleagues, though, are encouraging him to stick with teaching.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, right, high-fives preschooler Kodi during a name writing exercise, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nWhile Johnson is there to provide targeted literacy instruction, he has been fully integrated into the school day. His second week in the classroom, he sang the class's morning greeting song in a robot voice. When a child is squirming on the carpet or wandering away from story time, Johnson is there to rein them in.\n\nOn this October day, Johnson pulled students aside to help them work on writing their names. He had only been with this cohort for a couple weeks, but many students were drawn to him. During free-play time, he encouraged a student who was working on a crayon rubbing of a leaf.\n\n\"You've done a wonderful job,\" he said to the girl, who stared up at him, eager for reassurance. Another student interrupted him by handing him a fistful of play money.\n\nAfter lunchtime, as most of the preschoolers sat on the carpet held rapt by a story read by Jeffrys, 4-year-old Kodi Hendricks wandered toward the door and peered into the hallway until Johnson beckoned him back. Johnson bent his large frame to tie the boy's shoe and then they sat together for a penmanship lesson.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, left, helps preschooler Kodi to practice writing his name, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I.

Johnson showed him, in slow motion, how to draw a K.\n\n\"No, I can't do it,\" said the boy.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Johnson said. He urged him on.\n\n\"You can do it. It just takes practice.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump waves as he walks with former first lady Melania Trump at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump won the presidency after holding tight to his core base of voters and slightly expanding his coalition to include several groups that have traditionally been a part of the Democratic base. That finding comes from AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide that shows what issues mattered to voters in this election.\n\nTrump picked up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters, and made narrow gains with men and women. As Trump chipped away at parts of the Democratic coalition, Vice President Kamala Harris wasn't able to make enough of her own gains. Trump succeeded in locking down his traditionally older, white base of voters, and he slightly expanded his margins with other groups into a winning coalition.\n\nA look at how five key demographic groups voted, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nSlightly more than 8 in 10 Trump voters in this election were white, roughly in line with 2020. About two-thirds of Harris' voters were white, and that largely matched President Joe Biden 's coalition in the last election. White voters make up a bulk of the voting electorate in the United States, and they did not shift their support significantly at the national level compared to 2020.\n\nA majority of white voters cast their ballot for Trump, unchanged from the 2020 election that he narrowly lost. About 4 in 10 white voters backed Harris, which is about the same as Biden received in 2020. White voters were also more likely to support Trump over Harris and Biden in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, even though Trump lost those states in 2020.\n\nTrump was able to make slight inroads with Black voters nationally, who made up about 1 in 10 voters across the country.\n\nNationally, about 8 in 10 Black voters supported Harris. But, that was down from about 9 in 10 in the last presidential election who went for Biden.\n\nTrump about doubled his share of young Black men - which helped him among key Democratic voting group. About 3 in 10 Black men under the age of 45 went for Trump, roughly double the number he got in 2020.\n\nWhile Harris won more than half of Hispanic voters, that support was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic voters that Biden won.\n\nHispanic voters were more open to Trump than they were in 2020. Roughly half of Latino men voted for Harris, down from about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.\n\nTrump benefitted from narrow gains among both men and women, with Harris modestly underperforming compared with Biden in 2020.\n\nHarris had the advantage among women, winning 53% to Trump's 46%, but that margin was somewhat narrower than Biden's. Biden won 55% of women, while 43% went for Trump. His support held steady among white women - slightly more than half supported him, similar to 2020.\n\nTrump made a similar gain among men, with a modest shift increasing his advantage.\n\nThe shifts by gender were concentrated among younger voters, as well as Black and Latino voters. White voters across genders and older voters across genders voted similarly in 2024 as they did in 2020.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for Fox News, PBS NewsHour, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press. The survey of more than 120,000 voters was conducted for eight days, concluding as polls closed. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. The survey combines a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files; self-identified registered voters using NORC's probability based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population; and self-identified registered voters selected from nonprobability online panels. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 0.4 percentage points.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, right, and pastor Dr. J. Louis Felton pray at a church service at Mt. Airy Church of God in Christ, Sunday, July 7, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a church service at Mt. Airy Church of God in Christ, Sunday, July 7, 2024, in Philadelphia (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Phoenix pastor the Rev. Warren H. Stewart Sr. has had countless discussions this election season with fellow Black men on the economy, criminal justice, immigration and other issues dominating the political landscape in their battleground state of Arizona. But never abortion.\n\n\"They're about justice. They're about Donald Trump potentially reversing all of the gains achieved by the Civil Rights movement. They are not about abortion,\" said Stewart.\n\nIt's in stark contrast to what's being said on the campaign trail, where President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are wooing voters who support abortion rights , while Trump and his surrogates pursue anti-abortion voters.\n\nAlthough Black men traditionally back Democrats , one prevailing narrative is they are unenthusiastic about Biden, the presumptive party nominee. They make up close to 7% of the electorate, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, and this year, a few thousand votes in Arizona, Pennsylvania and other swing states could decide the race.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina remains concerned that Trumps' hyper masculine-campaign style is drawing those Black male voters who don't feel represented in mainstream politics away from the Democratic Party. Clyburn is trying to counter that trend .\n\nAfter his dismal debate performance enflamed concerns about his age, Biden, 81, also is trying to shore up his loyal base. He recently appeared at Mount Airy Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the state to quell lingering questions and rumors.\n\n\"I, honest to God, have never been more optimistic about America's future if we stick together,\" said Biden, addressing the congregation in a short speech that evoked Harris but did not mention abortion rights.\n\nAmong Black clergy, few are better positioned to assess Biden's character and fitness than Bishop Reginald T. Jackson.\n\nThe 132nd Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Jackson, 70, was an advance man on Biden's first campaign for U.S Senate in 1972, first getting an up-close view of the candidate's shortcomings as a student at Delaware State University.\n\n\"All this stuttering? That ain't nothing new,\" Jackson said from his home in Atlanta.\n\nJackson said Biden's recent flubs during the debate and subsequent news conferences shouldn't stop him from touting his record of support for historically Black colleges and his administration's advocacy for minority-owned small businesses.\n\n\"It's almost as if the items the president has accomplished are being held like some sort of state secret,\" Jackson said.\n\nOn abortion, Jackson believes the federal government shouldn't meddle in a decision best left to a woman and her doctor, and says he is satisfied with the Biden campaign's handling of the issue.\n\nOver the past half-century, abortion has remained a fractious issue across Black Protestant churches, fraught with questions about sexuality and gender that their Christian community has struggled with historically.\n\nIn interviews, Black church leaders acknowledged that the church has not always been adept at talking about human sexuality, a characteristic they share with their mainstream Protestant counterparts. In \"Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics, author R. Marie Griffith, a humanities professor at Washington University in St. Louis, argues that the wariness to discuss sex - and contend with their deep-seated views on female sexuality specifically - is at the heart of many of the most divisive political issues.\n\nOne Black male pastor in particular, Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, senior pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has been outspoken about his support for abortion access, especially during his 2022 re-election campaign.\n\nBut Warren Stewart, who leads First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix, wishes Biden and Harris weren't talking about abortion so much, even as he acknowledged the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe as a \"political gift.\" He believes abortion should be legal only in cases where the life of the individual giving birth is in danger.\n\nOthers disagree. The Rev. Leslie D. Callahan, the first woman to pastor Philadelphia's historic St. Paul's Baptist Church, said all men regardless of race need to decide what functions of their bodies they'd like controlled by the federal government. Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the US, according to the CDC's 2022 report .\n\n\"Without bodily autonomy, what freedom do you really have?\" she said.\n\nShe pointed out that Biden, who supports protecting access to abortion, isn't being called to resign from the presidency - just the campaign.\n\n\"If he's fit to govern, I don't quite understand why he's not fit to run,\" Callahan said. \"If you're going to scrutinize Biden, let's scrutinize his presidency and his policies. If you're going to scrutinize fitness, then there needs to be consistent and equal scrutiny around the fitness of his opponent.\"\n\nAs Trump tries to court Black voters , about 7 in 10 Black adults continue to have broadly negative views of him, according to an AP analysis of two consecutive polls conducted in June by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. However, that number is down 20 percentage points since early 2021.\n\nAlthough the Trump campaign has said Black men may be more receptive to his message , Black men and women have similar views of him.\n\nBlack men's opinion of Biden also isn't overwhelmingly positive. The poll analysis found that about half of Black men have a somewhat or very favorable view of Biden -- compared to about 7 in 10 Black women -- and about 4 in 10 Black men see the president negatively.\n\nThe Rev. Otis Moss Jr., pastor emeritus of the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church in Cleveland, one of the largest and best-known Black churches in Ohio, is disturbed by Trump's positions, saying the former president cares about preserving life before birth - but not after.\n\n\"The human rights of the woman, the female, should not be infringed upon by someone else's political ideology,\" Moss said.\n\nVice President Harris, a member of Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, addressed religious beliefs during her March visit to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota - the first-ever toured by a sitting president or vice president.\n\n\"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling women what to do with their body,\" Harris said.\n\n\"If she chooses, she will consult with her priest, her pastor, rabbi, her imam. But is that for the government to tell her what she can and cannot do with her own body?\"\n\nIndividualized pastoral care is better suited than blanket government policies for helping women and families work through hard and nuanced medical choices, including abortion, said Callahan. Many times, she said, people are deciding between two difficult alternatives - neither of which are optimal.\n\n\"The last thing that needs to be involved in that choice is some question about whether you're going to be able to find a doctor who'll be willing to risk whatever that risk is in order to help you get to physical, mental, and emotional health,\" she said.\n\nThis election season Planned Parenthood's advocacy and political organizations is working to engage, educate and mobilize Black men, among other demographic groups. Lead organizer Jamesa Bailey, director of Black campaigns for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said that their internal data suggested that once informed about what's at stake in the presidential election on the matter of abortion, they're three times more likely to educate another voter - and are more likely to make a plan to vote.\n\nAbortion-rights activists say most Black men are natural allies of their cause, yet they also say it's challenging to find the right messages for election-year mobilization.\n\nOne approach is tying the issue of safe, legal access to abortion to the Black maternal health crisis in America . Black Americans are more than twice as likely to die in childbirth, and well-documented research says states with the most restrictive barriers to abortion have the highest Black maternal mortality rates.\n\nThis issue has proven to be a \"very powerful\" motivator said Bailey, adding it could be why she saw a \"significant uptick\" in support from clergy and faith groups across the country.\n\nPresenting themselves as faith leaders in their respective communities in close to two dozen states, she said, they sought with their presence to make a bold, new statement as a community: that their belief in God was not in conflict with their belief in the woman's right to choose.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "text": "Where Social Change Happens One Life at a Time\n\nPhoto provided by 100 Black Men of America\n\nStone Mountain, Georgia, is no stranger to civil-rights unrest. One hundred years ago this November, Ku Klux Klan members, inspired by D.W. Griffithâs film Birth of a Nation , celebrated the ârebirthâ of their group by climbing to the summit and burning an enormous wooden cross. Since then, the 825-foot-tall peak has become a public park, theme park, and Confederate Mount Rushmore, featuring the worldâs largest bas relief: the likenesses of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and âStonewallâ Jackson carved into a three-acre triptych on the side of the mountain.\n\nSince the murder of nine black worshippers in Charleston, South Carolina, in June, such Confederate symbols have come under attack. âThose guys need to go,â the head of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP declared in July. âThey can be sandblasted off.â\n\nSymbols can be erased. Eliminating the real-world legacies of racial injustice is harder work. At a time when violent racial clashes still happen with disturbing frequency, it is important to celebrate the places where this work is underway.\n\nOne such place is the mentoring organization 100 Black Men of America (âthe 100â for short), whose national headquarters is in Atlanta, just twenty miles from Stone Mountain. The group began in New York in 1963, a turning point in the civil rights movementâthe year Alabama Governor George Wallace proclaimed, âSegregation forever!â and Martin Luther King declared, âI have a dream.â\n\nThe mission of the 100, which is concentrated in the South but has more than 100 chapters in 30 states, is to support African-American children and teens through one-on-one and group mentoring with inspiring black professional role models drawn from both public and private sectors. Though more than a half-century old, that mission could not be more timely or urgent today.\n\nAlthough females are involved as participants in the chaptersâ programs, three-quarters of the 100,000-plus mentees and youth participants are young men. âWe recognize that those young men have a challenge that is like no other,â says Brian Pauling, the groupâs president and CEO.\n\nOne of the 100âs goals is to prepare their young charges for interactions with law enforcement. âWe are having conversations with our youth, helping them to understand that the perception that someone may have of you may not be the reality,â says Pauling. The groupsâ leaders are also talking to police officers, prosecutors, judges and police review boards about not leniency but understanding. Pauling is emphatic about that: âNo one is telling law enforcement not to do their job.â\n\nPauling says that the number of recent violent incidents around the nation does not surprise him. âThere are a number of below-the-surface circumstances that could create a Ferguson in literally every city across our country,â he says. âThe question really becomes, what will be the spark that ignites the powder keg.â He points to a number of societal conditions for African-Americans that exacerbate the problem, including systemic inequalities they face in gaining access to quality education, jobs and health care.\n\nFor results, Pauling and his leadership rely on their 8,000 members in the field. Wayne Copper, 61, an Allstate agency owner in Stone Mountain, Georgia, is one of them. Copper, who volunteers with the Atlanta chapter, knows from experience how hard their work can be and what a difference mentorship can make.\n\nâA lot of these kids operate from impoverished conditions like you would not imagine,â he says. Copper credits his success at surmounting the problems of his own youth to the constant support of adults when he was young: âI always had an older gentleman saying, âSon, I can tell you are not a child that really belongs around here. Keep on doing good work in school, and I know that one day you will be something.ââ\n\nCopper works with grade-school students and young adults, some of them enrolled in college, and his mentorship is full-spectrum: He leads a large class of kids in a weekly discussion to talk about âlife issues and current eventsâ; he teaches a class on Saturday to help students with study skills and test-taking; and he is mentoring two young professionals about business practices. He and his wife Jan have taken their young charges to church, brunch, the theater and into their home for meals and holidays.\n\nAt an Atlanta public school with a high poverty rate, Copper has also been involved with an alternative kind of juvenile-court system to find new approaches to disciplinary issuesâavoiding suspensions whenever possible, for example, because being on the street invites more trouble. The men who volunteer for the 100, he says, are likely to understand better than most the sources of bad behavior. âSometimes itâs that these kids didnât have anything to wear or didnât have anything to eat,â he says. Or they could be grappling with family problems and âget in trouble for attention.â\n\nTo prepare their protÃ©gÃ©es for the racism they will likely encounter, Copper says he and his colleagues in the 100 âjust share our experiences. We say, âYou know, guys, this didnât just start today. Weâve experienced this for our whole lives. Not a day goes by that there isnât some way most of us feel weâve been discriminated against. You learn to deal with it.ââ\n\nAlthough 100 Black Men of America has no formal relationship with the Black Lives Matter movement, its chapters have marched with them in places like Ferguson. The approaches of the two movements, however, are dramatically different. While Black Lives Matter utilizes social media and public protest to advance their cause and express their dissatisfaction, the 100 utilizes its core competency of mentoring, private meetings and forums to advocate for the youth they serve. The group has attracted such formidable figures of the civil rights movement as Andrew Young and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, and has mobilized stalwart support for such White House initiatives as My Brotherâs Keeper and the Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African-Americans.\n\nThat said, the 100 is no less committed to change than their more publicly vocal counterparts. Pauling calls for âcreative destruction,â the kind of change that can move society and public institutions âto create something new that will provide better outcomes rather than changing things just for the sake of change.â\n\nMore than a half-century after Dr. Kingâs âI Have a Dream Speech,â less has changed than he might have hoped but more perhaps than he might have feared. In 1963, there was no Civil Rights Act; segregation and the poll tax were still legal; and the policemen of Birmingham, Alabama, turned dogs and high-pressure water hoses on young children before federal troops were called in to combat a wave of bombings and riots.\n\nIn the closing passage of that speech, King declared, âLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgiaâ¦.â\n\nFreedom is ringing a little louder today thanks to people like Wayne and Jan Copper and his 8,000 colleagues in the 100, as they work to fulfill the dream of the civil rights movement, one life at a time.\n\nâThatâs the legacy of giving,â says Wayne Copper. âHaving the opportunity to be right in there and being shoulder-to-shoulder and putting your arms around these kids.â\n\nSupport 160 years of independent journalism.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2019 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

      "text": "New Research Takes Aim at Stereotype That Black Young Men Are Not College Material\n\nTo improve the graduation rates among African-American men, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation aims to dispel the notion that this group is underrepresented in institutions of higher learning.\n\nAccording to a recent report, \" Challenging the Status Quo \" partially supported by the CBC Foundation, black males make up 5.5 percent of all college students age 18 and over, which is proportional to the adult black male population in the United States.\n\nChallenging such myths are important since it can perpetuate stereotypes that African-American young men are somehow disinterested in higher education and could even prevent them from obtaining the courses, mentorship or college preparation needed to succeed in college.\n\n\"The idea that black males are completely disaffected and beyond any reasonable efforts to remediate is an attitude that we frequently encounter when we train school leaders and educational administrators,\" argued the authors, both of whom are education professors. \"The cynicism and apathy among people who work with black boys are far more threatening to our future than the black male issues so ominously dramatized in the media.\"\n\nThe authors argued that such a false notion can influence a teacher or counselor to steer such students toward institutions with lower completion rates, such as community colleges.\n\nMore than 40 percent of the 1.2 million black men in college attend a community college. About 11 percent are enrolled in for-profit institutions, such as the University of Phoenix.\n\nThe report's coauthor, Ivory A. Toldson, a tenured associate professor at Howard University, has questioned another persistent belief that more black men are behind bars than on college campuses. It's part of his continuing reporting series titled, \" Show Me the Numbers ,\" published by The Root .\n\nGraduating African-American men from college is another story: Only 16 percent of black men have obtained a college degree, compared to 20 percent of black women. In general, college attainment rates among blacks and Hispanics are lower than that of the overall population, a recent Next America story explains.\n\nThe new report notes that many of the barriers for black young men begin before they enroll in college. Public middle and high schools with high black and Latino populations are more likely to have novice teachers, lack classroom resources, and offer fewer advanced college-preparation courses.\n\nIn addition, black male students are also more likely to get suspended. The report show that 59 percent of black males reported they had been suspended or expelled from school, compared to 42 percent of Latino males, and 26 percent of white males.\n\nThe report outlines some strategies that educators, community advocates, students, and parents can take that might lead to the goal of increasing graduation rates of black men by 20 percent by 2020.

      "text": "Of the Training of Black Men\n\n\"What place in the future development of the South ought the negro college and college-bred man to occupy?\"\n\nFrom the shimmering swirl of waters where many, many thoughts ago the slave-ship first saw the square tower of Jamestown have flowed down to our day three streams of thinking: one from the larger world here and over-seas, saying, the multiplying of human wants in culture lands calls for the world-wide coöperation of men in satisfying them. Hence arises a new human unity, pulling the ends of earth nearer, and all men, black, yellow, and white. The larger humanity strives to feel in this contact of living nations and sleeping hordes a thrill of new life in the world, crying, If the contact of Life and Sleep be Death, shame on such Life. To be sure, behind this thought lurks the afterthought of force and dominion, - the making of brown men to delve when the temptation of beads and red calico cloys.\n\nThe second thought streaming from the death-ship and the curving river is the thought of the older South: the sincere and passionate belief that somewhere between men and cattle God created a tertium quid , and called it a Negro, - a clownish, simple creature, at times even lovable within its limitations, but straitly foreordained to walk within the Veil. To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought, - some of them with favoring chance might become men, but in sheer self-defense we dare not let them, and build about them walls so high, and hang between them and the light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.\n\nAnd last of all there trickles down that third and darker thought, the thought of the things themselves, the confused half-conscious mutter of men who are black and whitened, crying Liberty, Freedom, Opportunity-vouchsafe to us, O boastful World, the chance of living men! To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought: suppose, after all the World is right and we are less than men? Suppose this mad impulse within is all wrong, some mock mirages from the untrue?\n\nSo here we stand among thoughts of human unity, even through conquest and slavery; the inferiority of black men, even if forced by fraud; a shriek in the night for the freedom of men who themselves are not yet sure of their right to demand it. This is the tangle of thought and afterthought wherein we are called to solve the problem of training men for life.\n\nBehind all its curiousness, so attractive alike to sage and dilettante, lie its dim dangers, throwing across us shadows at once grotesque and awful. Plain it is to us that what the world seeks through desert and wild we have within our threshold, - a stalwart laboring force, suited to the semi-tropics; if, deaf to the voice of the Zeitgeist, we refuse to use and develop these men, we risk poverty and loss. If, on the other hand, seized by the brutal afterthought, we debauch the race thus caught in our talons, selfishly sucking their blood and brains in the future as in the past, what shall save us from national decadence? Only that saner selfishness which, Education teaches men, can find the rights of all in the whirl of work.\n\nAgain, we may decry the color prejudice of the South, yet it remains a heavy fact. Such curious kinks of the human mind exist and must be reckoned with soberly. They cannot be laughed away, nor always successfully stormed at, nor easily abolished by act of legislature. And yet they cannot be encouraged by being let alone. They must be recognized as facts, but unpleasant facts; things that stand in the way of civilization and religion and common decency. They can be met in but one way: by the breadth and broadening of human reason, by catholicity of taste and culture. And so, too, the native ambition and aspiration of men, even though they be black, backward, and ungraceful, must not lightly be dealt with. To stimulate wildly weak and untrained minds is to play with mighty fires; to flout their striving idly is to welcome a harvest of brutish crime and shameless lethargy in our very laps. The guiding of thought and the deft coordination of deed is at once the path of honor and humanity.\n\nAnd so, in this great question of reconciling three vast and partially contradictory streams of thought, the one panacea of Education leaps to the lips of all: such human training as will best use the labor of all men without enslaving or brutalizing; such training as will give us poise to encourage the prejudices that bulwark society, and stamp out those that in sheer barbarity deafen us to the wail of prisoned souls within the Veil, and the mounting fury of shackled men.\n\nBut when we have vaguely said Education will set this tangle straight, what have we uttered but a truism? Training for life teaches living; but what training for the profitable living together of black men and white? Two hundred years ago our task would have seemed easier. Then Dr. Johnson blandly assured us that education was needful solely for the embellishments of life, and was useless for ordinary vermin. To-day we have climbed to heights where we would open at least the outer courts of knowledge to all, display its treasures to many, and select the few to whom its mystery of Truth is revealed, not wholly by truth or the accidents of the stock market, but at least in part according to deftness and aim, talent and character. This programme, however, we are sorely puzzled in carrying out through that part of the land where the blight of slavery fell hardest, and where we are dealing with two backward peoples. To make here in human education that ever necessary combination of the permanent and the contingent-of the ideal and the practical in workable equilibrium-has been there, as it ever must in every age and place, a matter of infinite experiment and frequent mistakes.\n\nIn rough approximation we may point out four varying decades of work in Southern education since the Civil War. From the close of the war until 1876 was the period of uncertain groping and temporary relief. There were army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau in chaotic disarrangement, seeking system and coöperation. Then followed ten years of constructive definite effort toward the building of complete school systems in the South. Normal schools and colleges were founded for the freedmen, and teachers trained there to man the public schools. There was the inevitable tendency of war to underestimate the prejudices of the master and the ignorance of the slave, and all seemed clear sailing out of the wreckage of the storm. Meantime, starting in this decade yet especially developing from 1885 to 1895, began the industrial revolution of the South. The land saw glimpses of a new destiny and the stirring of new ideals. The educational system striving to complete itself saw new obstacles and a field of work ever broader and deeper. The Negro colleges, hurriedly founded, were inadequately equipped, illogically distributed, and of varying efficiency and grade; the normal and high schools were doing little more than common school work, and the common schools were training but a third of the children who ought to be in them, and training these too often poorly. At the same time the white south, by reason of its sudden conversion from the slavery ideal, by so much the more became set and strengthened in its racial prejudice, and crystallized it into harsh law and harsher custom; while the marvelous pushing forward of the poor white daily threatened to take even bread and butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped sons of the freedmen. In the midst, then, of the larger problem of Negro education sprang up the more practical question of work, the inevitable economic quandary that faces a people in the transition from slavery to freedom, and especially those who make that change amid hate and prejudice, lawlessness and ruthless competition.\n\nThe industrial school springing to notice in this decade, but coming to full recognition in the decade beginning with 1895, was the proffered answer to this combined educational and economic crisis, and an answer of singular wisdom and timeliness. From the very first in nearly all the schools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but now was this training first raised to a dignity that brought it in direct touch with the South's magnificent industrial development, and given an emphasis which reminded black folk that before the Temple of Knowledge swing the Gates of Toil.\n\nYet after all they are but gates, and when turning our eyes from the temporary and the contingent in the Negro problem to the broader question of the permanent uplifting and civilization of black men in America, we have a right to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material advancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is the final and sufficient answer in the training of the Negro race; and to ask gently, but in all sincerity, the ever recurring query of the ages, Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment? And men ask this to-day all the more eagerly because of sinister signs in recent educational movements. The tendency is here, born of slavery and quickened to renewed life by the crazy imperialism of the day, to regard human beings as among the material resources of a land to be trained with an eye single to future dividends. Race prejudices, which keep brown and black men in their \"places,\" we are coming to regard as useful allies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the ambition and sicken the hearts of struggling human beings. And above all, we daily hear that an education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning, is the privilege of white men and the danger and delusion of black.\n\nEspecially has criticism been directed against the former educational efforts to aid the Negro. In the four periods I have mentioned, we find first, boundless, planless enthusiasm and sacrifice; then the preparation of teachers for a vast public school system; then the launching and expansion of that school system amid increasing difficulties; and finally the training of workmen for the new and growing industries. This development has been sharply ridiculed as a logical anomaly and flat reversal of nature. Soothly we have been told that first industrial and manual training should have taught the Negro to work, then simple schools should have taught him to read and write, and finally, after years, high and normal schools could have completed the system, as intelligence and wealth demanded.\n\nThat a system logically so complete was historically impossible, it needs but a little thought to prove. Progress in human affairs is more often a pull than a push, surging forward of the exceptional man, and the lifting of his duller brethren slowly and painfully to his vantage ground. Thus it was no accident that gave birth to universities centuries before the common schools, that made fair Harvard the first flower of our wilderness. So in the South: the mass of the freedmen at the end of the war lacked the intelligence so necessary to modern workingmen. They must first have the common school to teach them to read, write, and cipher. The white teachers who flocked South went to establish such a common school system. They had no idea of founding colleges; they themselves at first would have laughed at the idea. But they faced, as all men since them have faced, that central paradox of the South, the social separation of the races. Then it was the sudden volcanic rupture of nearly all relations between black and white, in work and government and family life. Since then a new adjustment of relations in economic and political affairs has grown up-an adjustment subtle and difficult to grasp, yet singularly ingenious, which leaves still that frightful chasm as the color line across which men pass at their peril. Thus, then and now, there stand in the South two separate worlds; and separate not simply in the higher realms of social intercourse, but also in church and school, on railway and street car, in hotels and theatres, in streets and city sections, in books and newspapers, in asylums and jails, in hospitals and graveyards. There is still enough of contact for large economic and group coöperation, but the separation is so thorough and deep, that it absolutely precludes for the present between the races anything like that sympathetic and effective group training and leadership of the one by the other, such as the American Negro and all backward peoples must have for effectual progress.\n\nThis the missionaries of '68 soon saw; and if effective industrial and trade schools were impractical before the establishment of a common school system, just as certainly no adequate common schools could be founded until there were teachers to teach them. Southern whites would not teach them; Northern whites in sufficient numbers could not be had. If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself, and the most effective help that could be given him was the establishment of schools to train Negro teachers. This conclusion was slowly but surely reached by every student of the situation until simultaneously, in widely separated regions, without consultation or systematic plan, there arose a series of institutions designed to furnish teachers for the untaught. Above the sneers of critics at the obvious defects of this procedure must ever stand its one crushing rejoinder: in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South; they wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible.\n\nSuch higher training schools tended naturally to deepen broader development: at first they were common and grammar schools, then some became high schools. And finally, by 1900, some thirty-four had one year or more of studies of college grade. This development was reached with different degrees of speed in different institutions: Hampton is still a high school, while Fisk University started her college in 1871, and Spelman Seminary about 1896. In all cases the aim was identical: to maintain the standards of the lower training by giving teachers and leaders the best practicable training; and above all to furnish the black world with adequate standards of human culture and lofty ideals of life. It was not enough that the teachers of teachers should be trained in technical normal methods; they must also, so far as possible, be broad-minded, cultured men and women, to scatter civilizations among a people whose ignorance was not simply of letters, but of life itself.\n\nIt can thus be seen that the work of education in the South began with higher institutions of training, which threw off as their foliage common schools, and later industrial schools, and at the same time strove to shoot their roots ever deeper toward college and university training. That this was an inevitable and necessary development, sooner or later, goes without saying; but there has been, and still is, a question in many minds if the natural growth was not forced, and if the higher training was not either overdone or done with cheap and unsound methods. Among white Southerners this feeling is widespread and positive. A prominent Southern journal voiced this in a recent editorial:\n\n\"The experiment that has been made to give the colored students classical training has not been satisfactory. Even though many were able to pursue the course, most of them did so in a parrot-like way, learning what was taught, but not seeming to appropriate the truth and import of their instruction, and graduating without sensible aim or valuable occupation for their future. The whole scheme has proved a waste of time, efforts, and the money of the state.\"\n\nWhile most fair-minded men would recognize this as extreme and overdrawn, still without doubt many are asking, Are there a sufficient number of Negroes ready for college training to warrant the undertaking? Are not too many students prematurely forced into this work? Does it not have the effect of dissatisfying the young Negro with his environment? And do these graduates succeed in real life? Such natural questions cannot be evaded, nor on the other hand must a nation naturally skeptical as to Negro ability assume an unfavorable answer without careful inquiry and patient openness to conviction. We must not forget that most American answer all queries regarding the Negro a priori , and that the least that human courtesy can do is to listen to evidence.\n\nThe advocates of the higher education of the Negro would be the last to deny the incompleteness and glaring defects of the present system: too many institutions have attempted to do college work, the work in some cases has not been thoroughly done, and quantity rather than quality has sometimes been sought. But all this can be said of higher education throughout the land; it is the almost inevitable incident of educational growth, and leaves the deeper question of the legitimate demand for the higher training of Negroes untouched. And this latter question can be settled in but one way-by a first-hand study of the facts. If we leave out of view all institutions which have not actually graduated students from a course higher than that of a New England high school, even though they be called colleges; if then we take the thirty-four remaining institutions, we may clear up many misapprehensions by asking searchingly, What kind of institutions are they, what do they teach and what sort of men do they graduate?\n\nAnd first we may say that this type of college, including Atlanta, Fisk and Howard, Wilberforce and Lincoln, Biddle, Shaw, and the rest, is peculiar, almost unique. Through the shining trees that whisper before me as I write, I catch glimpses of a boulder of New England, granite, covering a grave, which graduates of Atlanta University have placed there: -\n\nIn grateful memory of their former teacher and friend and of the unselfish life he lived, and the noble work he wrought; that they, their children, and their children's children might be blessed.\n\nThis was the gift of New England to the freed Negro: not alms, but a friend; not cash, but character. It was not and is not money these seething millions want, but love and sympathy, the pulse of hearts beating with red blood; a gift which to-day only their own kindred and race can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls brought to their favored children in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing in American history, and one of the few things untainted by sordid greed and cheap vainglory. The teachers in these institutions came not to keep the Negroes in their place, but to raise them out of their places where the filth of slavery had wallowed them. The colleges they founded were social settlements; homes where the best of the sons of the freedmen came in close and sympathetic touch with the best traditions of New England. They lived and ate together, studied and worked, hoped and harkened in the dawning light. In actual formal content their curriculum was doubtless old-fashioned, but in educational power it was supreme, for it was the contact of living souls.\n\nFrom such schools about two thousand Negroes have gone forth with the bachelor's degree. The number in itself is enough to put at rest the argument that too large a proportion of Negroes are receiving higher training. If the ratio to population of all Negro students throughout the land, in both college and secondary training, be counted, Commissioner Harris assures us \"it must be increased to five times its present average\" to equal the average of the land.\n\nFifty years ago the ability of Negro students in any appreciable numbers to master a modern college course would have been difficult to prove. To-day it is proved by the fact that four hundred negroes, many of whom have been reported as brilliant students, have received the bachelor's degree from Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, and seventy other leading colleges. Here we have, then, nearly twenty-five hundred Negro graduates, of whom the crucial query must be made, How far did their training fit them for life? It is of course extremely difficult to collect satisfactory data on such a point, - difficult to reach the men, to get trustworthy testimony, and to gauge that testimony by any generally acceptable criterion of success. In 1900, the Conference at Atlanta University undertook to study these graduates, and published the results. First they sought to know what these graduates were doing, and succeeded in getting answers from nearly two thirds of the living. The direct testimony was in almost all cases corroborated by the reports of the colleges where they graduated, so that in the main the reports were worthy of credence. Fifty-three per cent of these graduates were teachers, - presidents of institutions, heads of normal schools, principals of city school systems, and the like. Seventeen per cent were clergymen; another seventeen per cent were in the professions, chiefly as physicians. Over six per cent were merchants, farmers, and artisans, and four per cent were in the government civil service. Granting even that a considerable proportion of the third unheard from are unsuccessful, this is a record of usefulness. Personally I know many hundreds of these graduates, and have corresponded with more than a thousand; through others I have followed carefully the life-work of scores; I have taught some of them and some of the pupils whom they have taught, lived in homes which they have builded, and looked at life through their eyes. Comparing them as a class with my fellow students in New England and in Europe, I cannot hesitate in saying that nowhere have I met men and women with a broader spirit of helpfulness, with deeper devotion to their life-work, or with more consecrated determination to succeed in the face of bitter difficulties than among Negro college-bred men. They have, to be sure, their proportion of ne'er-do-weels, their pedants and lettered fools, but they have a surprisingly small proportion of them; they have not that culture of manner which we instinctively associate with university men, forgetting that in reality it is the heritage from cultured homes, and that no people a generation removed from slavery can escape a certain unpleasant rawness and gaucherie , despite the best of training.\n\nWith all their larger vision and deeper sensibility, these men have usually been conservative, careful leaders. They have seldom been agitators, have withstood the temptation to head the mob, and have worked steadily and faithfully in a thousand communities in the South. As teachers they have given the South a commendable system of city schools and large numbers of private normal schools and academies. Colored college-bred men have worked side by side with white college graduates at Hampton; almost from the beginning the backbone of Tuskegee's teaching force has been formed of graduates from Fisk and Atlanta. And to-day the institute is filled with college graduates, from the energetic wife of the principal down to the teacher of agriculture, including nearly half of the executive council and a majority of the heads of departments. In the professions, college men are slowly but surely leavening the Negro church, are healing and preventing the devastations of disease, and beginning to furnish legal protection for the liberty and property of the toiling masses. All this is needful work. Who would do it if Negroes did not? How could Negroes do it if they were not trained carefully for it? If white people need colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black people need nothing of the sort?\n\nIf it be true that there are an appreciable number of Negro youth in the land capable by character and talent to receive that higher training, the end of which is culture, and if the two and a half thousand who have had something of this training in the past have in the main proved themselves useful to their race and generation, the question then comes. What place in the future development of the South ought the negro college and college-bred man to occupy? That the present social separation and acute race sensitiveness must eventually yield to the influences of culture as the South grows civilized is clear. But such transformation calls for singular wisdom and patience. If, while the healing of this vast sore is progressing, the races are to live for many years side by side, united in economic effort, obeying a common government, sensitive to mutual thought and feeling, yet subtly and silently separate in many matters of deeper human intimacy-if this unusual and dangerous development is to progress amid peace and order, mutual respect and growing intelligence, it will call for social surgery at once the delicatest and nicest in modern history. It will demand broad-minded, upright men both white and black, and in its final accomplishment American civilization will triumph. So far as white men are concerned, this fact is to-day being recognized in the South, and a happy renaissance of university education seems imminent. But the very voices that cry Hail! to this good work are, strange to relate, largely silent or antagonistic to the higher education of the Negro.\n\nStrange to relate! for this is certain, no secure civilization can be built in the South with the Negro as an ignorant, turbulent proletariat. Suppose we seek to remedy this by making them laborers and nothing more: they are not fools, they have tasted of the Tree of Life, and they will not cease to think, will not cease attempting to read the riddle of the world. By taking away their best equipped teachers and leaders, by slamming the door of opportunity in the faces of their bolder and brighter minds, will you make them satisfied with their lot? or will you not rather transfer their leading from the hands of men taught to think to the hands of untrained demagogues? We ought not to forget that despite the pressure of poverty, and despite the active discouragement and even ridicule of friends, the demand for higher training steadily increases among Negro youth: there were, in the years from 1875 to 1880, twenty-two Negro graduates from Northern colleges; from 1885 to 1890 there were forty-three, and from 1895 to 1900, nearly 100 graduates. From Southern Negro colleges there were, in the same three periods, 143, 413, and over 500 graduates. Here, then, is the plain thirst for training; by refusing to give this Talented Tenth the key to knowledge can any sane man imagine that they will lightly lay aside their yearning and contentedly become hewers of wood and drawers of water?\n\nNo. The dangerously clear logic of the Negro's position will more and more loudly assert itself in that day when increasing wealth and more intricate social organization preclude the south from being, as it so largely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk. Such waste of energy cannot be spared it the south is to catch up with civilization. And as the black third of the land grows in thrift and skill, unless skillfully guided in its larger philosophy, it must more and more brood over the red past and the creeping, crooked present, until it grasps a gospel of revolt and revenge and throws its new-found energies athwart the current of advance. Even to-day the masses of the Negroes see all too clearly the anomalies of their position and the moral crookedness of yours. You may marshal strong indictments against them, but their counter-cries, lacking though they be in formal logic, have burning truths within them which you may not wholly ignore, O Southern Gentlemen! If you deplore their presence here, they ask, Who brought us? When you shriek, Deliver us from the vision of intermarriage, they answer, that legal marriage is infinitely better than systematic concubinage and prostitution. And if in just fury you accuse their vagabonds of violating women, they also in fury quite as just may wail: the rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless black women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two millions of mulattoes, and written in infeffaceable blood. And finally, when you fasten crime upon this race as its peculiar trait, they answer that slavery was the arch-crime, and lynching and lawlessness its twin abortion; that color and race are not crimes, and yet they it is which in this land receive most unceasing condemnation, North, East, South, and West.\n\nI will not say such arguments are wholly justified-I will not insist that there is no other side to the shield; but I do say that of the nine millions of Negroes in this nation, there is scarcely one out of the cradle to whom these arguments do not daily present themselves in the guise of terrible truth. I insist that the question of the future is how best to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs of the past and the difficulties of the present, so that all their energies may be bent toward a cheerful striving and coöperation with their white neighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future. That one wise method of doing this lies in the closer knitting of the Negro to the great industrial possibilities of the South is a great truth. And this the common schools and the manual training and trade schools are working to accomplish. But these alone are not enough. The foundations of knowledge in this race, as in others, must be sunk deep in the college and university if we would build a solid, permanent structure. Internal problems of social advance must inevitably come, - problems of work and wages, of families and homes, of morals and the true valuing of the things of life; and all these and other inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself, by reason of his isolation; and can there be any possible solution other than by study and thought and an appeal to the rich experience of the past? Is there not, with such a group and in such a crisis, infinitely more anger to be apprehended from half-trained minds and shallow thinking than from over-education and over-refinement? Surely we have wit enough to found a Negro college so manned and equipped as to steer successfully between the dilettante and the fool. We shall hardly induce black men to believe that if their bellies be full it matters little about their brains. They already dimly perceive that the paths of peace winding between honest toil and dignified manhood call for the guidance of skilled thinkers, the loving reverent comradeship between the black lowly and black men emancipated by training and culture.\n\nThe function of the Negro college then is clear: it must maintain the standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and coöperation. And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men. Above our modern socialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must persist and evolve that higher individualism which the centres of culture protect; there must come a loftier respect for the sovereign human soul that seeks to know itself and the world about it; that seeks a freedom for expansion and self-development; that will love and hate and labor in its own way, untrammeled alike by old and new. Such souls aforetime have inspired and guided worlds, and if we be not wholly bewitched by our Rhine-gold, they shall again. Herein the longing of black men must have respect: the rich and bitter depth of their experience, the unknown treasures of their inner life, the strange rendings of nature they have seen, may give the world new points of view and make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human hearts. And to themselves in these the days that try their souls the chance to soar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer spirits above the smoke is to their finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black.\n\n* * *\n\nI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not. Across the color line I move arm in arm with Balzac and Dumas, where smiling men and welcoming women glide in gilded halls. From out the caves of Evening that swing between the strong-limbed earth and the tracery of the stars, I summon Aristotle and Aurelius and what soul I will, and they come all graciously with no scorn nor condescension. So, wed with Truth, I dwell above the Veil. Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly America? Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia? Are you so afraid lest peering from this high Pisgah, between Philistine and Amalekite, we sight the Promised Land?"

With a majority of children from households led by single mothers, Johnson said, the men were inspired to show some extra support.\n\n\"The way America portrays black men in this country in these past few months, past year, has been horrible,\" Johnson said. \"We're looked at as a problem. So for these kids to walk into school, to see well-dressed doctors, lawyers, business owners, judges, politicians-all African-Americans-it's important. It makes a difference.\"\n\nAnd they had support in droves. On the morning of Aug. 25, just over 100 men arrived, decked out in suits, and high-fived and encouraged the kids from the parking lot all the way to the front door.\n\n(Related article: \"My Research Shows That Black Men Are Not Dangerous\" )\n\nPhotos by Keith Claytor , a Hartford resident who has a three-year-old son."

      "text": "The Life of a Little Black Boy in America\n\nThe joys and vulnerabilities of a Black childhood, as seen from a father's gaze\n\nPhotographs by Rashod Taylor\n\nRashod Taylor , a fine-art photographer based in Bloomington, Illinois, has been documenting Black American life for years. His ongoing analog photo series Little Black Boy is an intimate and weighty record of his son's childhood. It began in 2015, when his son was born. This year, after the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protest movement that followed, Taylor's black-and-white family portraits acquired even more gravity. We recently talked about how fatherhood, patriotism, and Blackness coalesce, in both joyous and uneasy ways, in his project.\n\nTaylor's reflections from our interview have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a difference between a little white boy growing up in America and a little Black boy. In my photo Deep Sleep , it looks like my son is sleeping, and it's beautiful. But for me, the image also has this postmortem look. It reveals my fears of him not coming home one day and having to bury him, like so many other Black parents have. There are things I am already teaching him that other kids his age are not thinking of. Like, Hey, we probably shouldn't wear a hoodie at night . At the same time, he's just a little boy in the United States.\n\nThat's also what I want to show: the love and tenderness of growing up Black. As a family, we are just living our lives, like everybody else. My son is 5. I started to photograph him the day he was born. Over time, as I looked at the images I was making, I noticed they were going deeper than just the standard dad snapshots. They began to represent not only documentary, but also a commentary on the Black experience. What happened this year was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted racism still present in our country. However, there seems to be a raised awareness and consciousness of what Black people go through. For me, it reiterated the importance of the perspectives brought forth by my photographs.\n\nWhen I was younger, I would hear my dad talk about his travels. Seeing other cultures and other people was great, but he would always come back home and say, \"I am really happy to live in America. I feel proud to be Black and a U.S. citizen.\" As I get older, I have found that I feel the same way. But there's also this duality. Because I love America, but America doesn't love me back. It's a weight I am bearing for my son before he can handle it on his own.\n\nI got interested in photography through family albums. If you look at the history of photography, you probably won't find too many examples of fathers photographing their sons. There are some prominent women, like Sally Mann, who photographed their children. But not a lot of men-particularly Black men. This record of the relationship between my son and me shows vulnerability. I want him to grow up knowing that he doesn't have to be tough all the time. It's okay to be sensitive. It's okay to have a picture cuddling up with your dad.\n\nMy son has always been an integral collaborator in the art-making process of this series. At the beginning, he was always happy to pose for me. In the last year or so, it's turned into more of a negotiation. But the thing is, once he sees the pictures, he loves them. He's like, Oh, wow. That's me ."

      "text": "'Educated' Black Men Appear 'Whiter' in Memory\n\nProof: The human mind has some awful tendencies.\n\nReading an academic paper on racism is like reading an alien's take on the human species.\n\nIn their summary of the way humans think, these aliens describe racism as \"phenotypic features associated with the social categorization of racial groups [that] have been strongly linked to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.\" Don't those humans know those \"phenotypic features\" (i.e., genetic factors) that form race only account for 6 to 10 percent of the genetic differences between humans? Silly humans. Often this stereotyping manifests itself in what's called \"skin tone memory bias,\" or, in the common tongue, racism.\n\nFor all their academic euphemisms, the psychologists on a new study in the Journal Sage Open , are not aliens. But they do coolly describe the way subjects implicitly associate \"ignorance\" with dark skin tone, and \"education\" with light skin tone.\n\nThe students tested at San Francisco State University were shown words like \"ignorant\" and \"educated\" for 33 milliseconds. These subliminal prompts are part of a phenomenon known as priming, a manipulation by researchers that preps participants' minds for a given experiment. After the subliminal word, they saw a picture of a black man.\n\nPriming is a powerful tool for psychologists. Basically, simple words or cues activate semantic networks in the brain and make the ideas connected to that semantic network easier to access. The effect is commonly illustrated by a simple experiment: When a researcher hands a person a cup of warm water, they're more likely to describe someone as being warm or friendly. In flashing the word \"ignorance\" before their participant's eyes, the psychologists make everything with an \"ignorance\" association in their participant's mind all the more accessible.\n\nWhat they found was this: The students primed with \"educated\" were more likely to rate the black man's skin tone as lighter on a memory test later. \"Black individuals who defy social stereotypes might not challenge social norms sufficiently but rather may be remembered as lighter, perpetuating status quo beliefs,\" the authors summarize. That is, when primed to think of a \"black person\" and \"educated\" in the same mental space, the black person becomes whiter. The stereotype distorts the memory.\n\nThe researchers elaborate:\n\nWhereas encountering a Black individual after being primed with the word educated might pose a challenge to existing beliefs, encountering a Black individual after being primed with the word ignorant would likely not require resolution or a misremembering of skin tone to align with these beliefs.\n\nThe effects of skin bias have real consequences: The \"more black\" a person appears, the more they are likely to be sentenced to death ( in an experiment ). In the real world, darker-skinned women were found to spend more time in jail .\n\nNow, it's unfair to label this study's participants as outright racists. Just because a subliminal cue changes their perceptions of a person doesn't mean those perceptions change the way they might engage with or treat that person in the real world. What the study does show is that these connections exist, and they can subtly change our behavior without us ever knowing it."

      "text": "Herschel Walker Is an American Tragedy\n\nBlack bodies, white agendas\n\nCommodity. Chattel. Contraband. Capital. What is a Black body in the South? What is a Black southern man, carted out to work a white-owned field?\n\nIt's impossible today to talk about Black men and white agendas without talking about Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate for Senate in the runoff election in Georgia. But in order to talk about Walker, I've got to start in what may be his actual state of residence, Texas.\n\nJemele Hill: Herschel Walker's candidacy is just insulting\n\nI watched the film version of Friday Night Lights almost obsessively during my senior year of high school. My father had just died. He was a diplomat, a businessman, and the general counsel of the U.S. Army, and he loved conservative optics and southern spaces and all manner of iconic Americana, for good or ill. So the movie connected me to him, or something-offered me catharsis, or something. The movie immersed me in all of the hard, strange things about the South, the questions about achievement and race and class and excellence and objectification, and what it can mean to lose or win or talk to God about any of it.\n\nBut there was one scene I hated to watch.\n\nCoach Gaines is getting ready for the start of the season, and attending a booster-club dinner with a table of wealthy white donors who presumably love God and football and Texas and not a whole lot else. It's a subtle scene, the dinner party spliced with distracting clips of the players at a raucous high-school party. A woman talks almost salaciously about the physicality of the young men she saw on the field during practice: \"What I saw was speed out there, but where's the beef, Coach? I saw me some small boys.\" The master's wife, perusing the auction block. Then a cut to more beer guzzling, more Run-D.M.C., more teenage hijinks. And then it's back to the elegant, sinister dining room.\n\nQuietly, the woman worried about how small the players are this year offers Gaines some advice. \"You know what you should do?\" she says. \"You should play Boobie Miles [on] defense. Work him both ways.\"\n\nCoach doesn't quite see it that way-you don't risk your prize thoroughbred on a recreational outing. \"Well, see, the problem with that is,\" he replies, \"I don't want to get him hurt. We need him to score touchdowns.\"\n\nThe woman doesn't miss a beat. And her reply is seared forever on my brain. \"Bullshit. That big nigger ain't gonna break. You wanna beat Midland Lee, you play him middle linebacker.\"\n\nThat big nigger ain't gonna break . Every time I watch one of these smug, jowly, dangerous Republicans sitting next to Herschel Walker, wheeling him out for their own designs, I see that dinner-table conversation in the background of my mind. Walker is a big, ball-carrying Black man, and these Republicans do not have an ounce of care for him. They are using him to advance their own Constitution-compromising agenda, the way conservative white people in this country have always used Black bodies when given half a chance.\n\nWalker stands up at podiums, and I feel shame and sorrow and resentment. He is incoherent, bumbling, oily. He smiles with a swagger that does nothing to disguise his total ignorance of how blatantly he is being taken advantage of by a party that has never intended to serve people who look like him.\n\nWalker's candidacy is a fundamental assault by the Republican Party on the dignity of Black Americans. How dare they so cynically use this buffoon as a shield for their obvious failings to meet the needs and expectations of Black voters? They hold him up and say, \"See, our voters don't mind his race. We're not a racist party. We have Black people on our side too.\" Parading Walker at rallies like some kind of blue-ribbon livestock does not mean you have Black people on your side. What it means is that you are promoting a charlatan-a man morally and intellectually bereft enough, blithely egomaniacal enough, to sing and dance on the world stage against his own best interest. Is he in on the joke? Does he know they picked him to save money on boot black and burnt cork, this man who made his name by bringing the master glory on the master's field, who got comfortable eating from the master's table?\n\nFor the record, Coach Gaines did play Boobie Miles, and Boobie Miles suffered a career-ending injury. And the team carried on. They left him and his broken Black body behind. His dreams, nothing to them. His legacy, utterly compromised.\n\nDevin Gordon: America ruined college football. Now college football is ruining America.\n\nWhether Walker wins or loses, whatever was good or valuable or worthy about his prior professional legacy has been utterly compromised. His many trophies are now and forever eclipsed by the humiliating spectacle of his political foray. He is ruined, and the party that propped him up does not care.\n\nFrom where I sit, the election looks like a kind of grotesque minstrelsy. The Republican Party is saying that it wants power more than decency. It's saying that race is a joke. We must all take note-it is willing to destroy a man to advance its cause. The party thinks he won't break. And if he does, well, he wasn't really one of them, anyway, was he?\n\nI grew up in Tennessee and still live here. Although it has become obscure, in the South, if you listen closely in the right (wrong) crowd, you will still hear the term ofe thrown around to describe a Black person. Not o-a-f . Ofe, spelled o-f-e . Obsolete Farm Equipment.\n\nI'll ask again: What does it mean to be a Black man in the South, working a white-owned field?\n\nI don't particularly care that Herschel Walker doesn't seem to know he's being used. I care that America let it get this far, that this country has been wildly careless with Black bodies, Black stories, Black truths. I care that I'm watching the news every day with the foot of bigotry on my back and the noose of regression tightening around my throat.\n\nWhoever wins today, Walker's candidacy is an American tragedy."

      "text": "The Familial Language of Black Grief\n\nBlack people feel the pain and loss of black life as if it were our very own blood that had been brutalized-because it easily could have been.\n\nI cracked a joke to break the tension. \"Everyone put on your seat belts, because the cops are definitely pulling us over tonight.\" Psychologists say that laughter relieves stress and reduces anxiety-I guess that's what I was going for in that moment. We were five black men sitting in a very nice car, a black Range Rover, about to go out for a night on the town. As I recall, we really tore it up at the local coffee shop with our lattes and pour-overs.\n\nIt was the autumn of 2015 and the phrase Black Lives Matter was then, as it is now, the subject of a national dialogue. We had seen a slew of videos showing police brutalizing or killing unarmed black people, and it was on all of our minds that evening, how quickly human beings could be reduced to hashtags. We all felt like we could be next. The police could easily stop us for no reason. They simply had to say that we \"fit the description.\"\n\nIf you asked each of us in that SUV, everyone could tell you about a horrifying encounter he'd had with the police during a routine traffic stop or a case of mistaken identity or presumed guilt. Patted down, hands on the car, faced with a drawn gun, cuffed, cussed at-different forms of the same terror that has characterized interactions between law-enforcement officers and black people for decades. It was this shared sense of danger that made us feel like more than friends-we were brothers.\n\nI thought of this unspoken understanding that black people share recently when I heard the former NBA player Stephen Jackson's speech about his friend, George Floyd, who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. At a rally in Floyd's honor he said, \"I'm here because they're not gonna demean the character of George Floyd, my twin ... You can't tell me that [the officer] didn't feel that it was his duty to murder my brother, and that he knew he was gonna get away with it.\" Jackson and Floyd had known each other for years. Shared experiences, laughter, and history made them friends. But when the officer killed Floyd, Jackson mourned his \"twin\" and his \"brother.\"\n\nRead: Minneapolis had this coming\n\nOne of the last things that the 46-year-old Floyd did as he was being killed was call out to his deceased mother. \"Mama ... I'm through,\" he can be heard saying in video that captured the incident. The protests that followed picked up that cry. One person carried a sign that read \"All mothers were summoned when George Floyd cried out for his mama.\"\n\nNotions of family saturate the black freedom struggle in all of its aspects, especially the threat of police brutality. Under the constant surveillance, suspicion, and violence of law enforcement in America, black people share a kinship of calamity. A brotherhood and sisterhood of suffering. Like any family, it is not something we choose. This sense of solidarity through hardship is forced on us by the oppression we endure in a white-supremacist society.\n\nEven with people we do not know or whom we barely know, black people can generally relate to the experience of being policed not just by law enforcement, but by anyone deemed white. Police brutality feels like a problem that is both very old and freshly personal every time it happens. We feel the pain and loss of black life as if it were our very own blood that had been brutalized-because it easily could have been.\n\nIn July 2013, shortly after a jury found Trayvon Martin's killer not guilty, President Barack Obama gave a speech in which he said: \"You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son.\"\n\nObama used the language of family to convey why, even as president of the United States, he felt the verdict so personally. Obama, along with countless other black people, mourned Martin's death and the acquittal of his killer as if Martin had been our own son or sibling.\n\nI remember the death of Philando Castile hitting me particularly hard. In 2016, a police officer killed Castile during a routine traffic stop. Castile told the officer that he had a lawfully registered gun in the car. In his testimony , the officer said he was \"in fear for my life\" when he fired seven bullets into the vehicle. Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, caught the aftermath on her cellphone camera, all while her 4-year-old daughter sat in the back seat.\n\nRead: The black women who paved the way for this moment\n\nI never met Castile, but hearing of his death hurt like losing a brother. I could picture myself in the same situation-pulled over with my partner and child in our family car, the definition of nonthreatening. Yet a police officer could still perceive my black body, like he did brother Castile's, as a menace that needed to be neutralized using deadly force.\n\nThis familial language is metaphorical, of course-I know that the pain I felt seeing Castile killed doesn't compare to what his loved ones felt. But it's the best metaphor black people have to express the grief that unites us.\n\nAnd like all families, this brotherhood and sisterhood of suffering is complicated. It's not the Brady Bunch. The movement for black lives has its arguments and animosities; people get estranged from one another. Sometimes black people reject relationships with their community. Some don't see issues such as police brutality as rooted in historic patterns of oppression. Some black people think the way to get ahead in a white-supremacist society is to get away from black folks. As we say, \"All skinfolk ain't kinfolk.\"\n\nRead: The first step is figuring out what the police are for\n\nBut when white supremacy takes its toll on these black people as well, which it almost always does, only one community will understand and gather around them, maybe with a hearty \"I told you so\" first.\n\nHowever families may fight, they tend to come together in a crisis. Right now the crisis of police brutality has once again given cause for black people around the country, and even the world, to gather in defense of one another."

      "text": "Of Course Black Men Are Drifting Toward Trump\n\nThese voters tend to be both more culturally conservative and more economically liberal than the current version of the Democratic Party.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nD onald Trump's history of racism is breathtaking. His track record of prejudice is so prodigious that keeping all of the incidents straight is difficult: There's the Central Park Five, the \"Muslim ban,\" his response to Charlottesville. \"Shithole\" countries and lamenting that Nigerian immigrants won't \"go back to their huts.\" The fabrications about Haitians eating pets. There's Sunday's horrifying Madison Square Garden rally , where Trump surrogates made racist comments about Harris and Puerto Rico. The list goes on. And grows. You would be hard-pressed to find a more brazenly racist major American politician on this side of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nFuture historians will therefore marvel at the fact that Trump has increased his support among African Americans since he was elected to the presidency in 2016. No serious person expects Trump to win anything close to a majority of Black voters in this year's election. But months upon months of polls-from a welter of different pollsters-predict Trump substantially growing his share of those voters, particularly young Black men . In a recent poll of Black voters, 58 percent of Black men said they'd support Vice President Kamala Harris if the election were held today, and 26 percent said they'd vote for Trump-a percentage that would represent record-setting support for a Republican candidate.\n\nOther forms of evidence- shoe-leather reporting , first-person testimony , 16 years of declining Black male support for Democratic presidential candidates, the presence of the Black manosphere -suggest that we are in the midst of a substantial racial realignment . If Democratic candidates have long benefited from Black magic-the near-universal support of African Americans-the spell has been broken for a growing share of Black men. Now Democrats, including the Harris campaign, are trying to figure out how to cast a new one. But the chances of stopping the realignment appear slim, because Black voters are both more culturally conservative and more economically liberal than the current version of the Democratic Party.\n\nRead: Why do Black people vote for Democrats?\n\nL auren Harper Pope , a political and communications strategist, told me politicians need to start thinking of Black men-in contrast to more reliably Democratic Black women-as politically independent. \"I've been telling people for months: Black men, Hispanic men, minority men are independent voters,\" she said. \"People need to look past the concept that if you're a Black man with a college degree, you're going to vote for a Democrat. No. Absolutely not. I've got plenty of Black friends who have college degrees who are from the South, not from the South, whatever, who are genuinely concerned about things the Democratic Party is doing.\"\n\nSharon Wright Austin, a political scientist at the University of Florida, also believes that some level of realignment is happening. \"I do think we have to take the polls seriously, because they are showing that Donald Trump is getting more support among Black men,\" she told me. \"I don't know if the numbers are going to be as high as the polls indicate. I do think there are going to be some African Americans who are going to vote for Trump because they find him to be a better candidate.\" Austin noted that the strength of the economy under Trump, as well as some Black men's discomfort with Democratic positions on cultural issues such as abortion , trans rights , and immigration , are likely driving some of this defection.\n\nOther political scientists who specialize in Black politics contest the idea that Black voting habits are meaningfully changing. Justin Zimmerman, a political-science professor at the University of Albany, said that the kind of frustration Black men are exhibiting isn't new. \"It's not so much that there's no Black political disenchantment with the Democratic Party,\" Zimmerman told me. \"That's always been there.\" He said that most rankled African Americans will likely hold their nose and vote for a candidate they may not be enthusiastic about, something Black voters have had to do throughout American history.\n\nChristopher Towler, who directs the Black Voter Project and is a partner at Black Insights Research, also dismissed the notion that African Americans are undergoing a meaningful transition away from the Democratic Party. He argues that polls frequently rely on small sample sizes of Black voters, which makes getting a representative cross-section of the Black community impossible.\n\n\"You have a sample that has [18 to19] percent support for Trump, but it has a nine-point margin of error,\" Towler told me. \"That means it could be as low as 10 or as high as 27 percent. That tells us absolutely nothing.\"\n\nAlthough this point about sample size is reasonable and was echoed by other political scientists I interviewed, it fails to explain why those sample-size errors would lead to polling consistently skewed in one direction. And, more important, it discounts historical trends: Democrats have been bleeding male Black voters for nearly two decades.\n\nSome degree of realignment was probably inevitable, given the widening mismatch between the worldview of many Black men and that of the Democratic Party. Many Black voters are quite conservative , especially culturally, and they may hold views on issues like abortion and gender that are more at home in the Republican Party. In June, the Pew Research Center released what is perhaps the most comprehensive recent survey of American opinions about fraught cultural issues. Conducted when Joe Biden was still the Democrats' presidential nominee, Pew's polling illustrates notable contrasts between the views of Black and white supporters of the Democratic candidate. On an array of cultural questions, Black Biden supporters were not simply more conservative than their white peers; they were more conservative than any other demographic group in the Democratic coalition.\n\nPew found that Black Biden supporters were the least likely to answer questions about immigrants favorably, trailing white supporters by double digits. Similarly, Black Biden voters were about twice as likely to say that \"an emphasis on marriage and family makes society better off\" compared with their white counterparts. And whereas only 32 percent of white Biden supporters agreed that \"gender is determined by a person's sex assigned at birth,\" 64 percent of Black Biden voters said they agreed. Black Biden voters were also much less likely than any other group of Biden voters to say they were comfortable with they / them pronouns. When the questions turned to religion, the differences were even more stark: 35 percent of Black Biden voters said \"government should support religious values\" and more than half-a higher percentage than among Trump supporters -said \"belief in God is needed for morality.\" Only 7 and 8 percent of white Biden supporters, respectively, said the same. A different Pew survey from the same period also found that majorities of Black men and Black women agreed that \"the government [promotes] birth control and abortion to keep the Black population small.\" Again, these polls were not conducted when Harris was the candidate, but there is little reason to believe that cultural attitudes among Black Democrats suddenly changed when she became the nominee.\n\nS ince Trump's rise , Democrats have seemed to assume that if they yell about his racism, misogyny, and authoritarian tendencies enough, African Americans will be scared or shamed into voting for Hillary Clinton, Biden, and now Harris. Eight years ago, the Clinton campaign dropped an ad tying Trump to Ku Klux Klan members; after she lost the election, she warned that Trump supporters wanted to take away the rights of Black Americans. For this year's presidential race, the Harris campaign has commissioned former President Barack Obama to scold Black men for allegedly being too sexist to vote for the first Black woman president. Harris is hammering messages about fascism, racism, and democracy in the campaign's final week even though polls have shown that these talking points are among the least popular with voters of all kinds-to say nothing of the fact that Black voters have been moving toward Trump despite nearly a decade of those messages being shouted from a bullhorn.\n\nDemocrats seem unwilling to believe that a small but significant portion of Black voters might be willing to overlook Trump's racism, and are even drawn to aspects of his nationalism, xenophobia, and traditionalism. When Biden won in 2020, many liberal talking heads cheered that \"Black voters saved democracy\" and heaped praise on Black \"superhero women\" as part of an outpouring of awkward gratitude that several Black pundits noted was a little fetishistic and traded in \"magical negro tropes.\" Some progressives seem to imagine minority voters as mythical beings, electoral angels who radiate light and virtue. In their minds, the Democratic Party is a Marvel movie coalition of Nice Whites and Saintly Blacks and Browns who team up every four years to try to save the country from the Bad Whites: the hodgepodge of unsavory working-class whites and car-dealership-owning whites and Christian-nationalist whites who make up Trump's coalition. But people of color are people, not saints or saintly monoliths, and the cost of this idealization has been a certain blindness in Democratic circles to the actual, rather than imagined, political landscape within minority communities. And it's not just African Americans: Other male minority voters are also generally less liberal than white Democrats. Recent polls found that 44 percent of young Latino men back Trump and more than half of Hispanic men support deportations of undocumented immigrants (51 percent) and building the border wall (52 percent). These men are more than twice as likely to say Trump, compared with Biden, helped them personally.\n\nThe question, then, is what to do about these growing tensions between the cultural views of Black Americans and other minority voters and those of the Democratic Party. Despite their competing views on realignment, the experts I spoke with largely agreed that Democrats tend to take Black voters for granted, and that the Harris campaign should have started doing targeted outreach to Black voters much sooner. \"What Black folks want is an identifiable, explicit agenda,\" the political scientist Sekou Franklin told me, one that appeals to their unique needs and interests. He added, \"That's what they're seeing with LGBTQ+ persons ... That's what they're seeing with women, so they want the same thing.\" Others said that some in the Black community think too much money is going to help foreign countries overseas, while Black Americans-especially Black men-struggle at home. Black Americans are among the least supportive of sending military aid to Ukraine and Israel .\n\nDaniel K. Williams: Democrats can't rely on the Black Church anymore\n\nWhat Harris has offered to combat these perceptions has been less than inspiring. Trying to court young Black men with policy proposals on crypto, weed legalization, and mentorship programs-the focus of a recent policy rollout-is both confusing and condescending . One ambitious proposal, handing out loans to Black Americans on the basis of race, is very possibly illegal , and thus likely an empty promise. And although Harris has moved to the right explicitly and implicitly on a number of cultural and economic issues , there is approximately zero chance that she can outflank Donald Trump on problems such as immigration, no matter how much she wants to expand the border wall . Anyone whose primary concern is the southern border is almost certainly going to vote for the former president. So if shifting right on cultural and social issues is unlikely to move the needle, what will?\n\nThe answer is staring Democrats in the face. If Black voters are perhaps the most culturally conservative wing of the Democratic coalition, they also tend to be among the most progressive on economic issues. A survey this summer found that Black voters are almost twice as likely as other racial demographics to say that \"the government should provide more assistance to people in need\" and also more likely than any other group to say that Social Security benefits should be expanded. And roughly two-thirds of African Americans say that the government should have a more active hand in solving problems. Another survey found that a majority of African Americans have critical views of the country's prison system (74 percent), courts (70 percent), policing (68 percent), big businesses (67 percent), economic system (65 percent), and health-care system (51 percent). These are issues that the Democratic Party can credibly claim to be better at addressing than Republicans.\n\nBlack voters' realignment seems less like a sea change than something akin to coastal erosion: a grinding process that can be stopped with concerted collective effort. Democrats cannot out-Republican the Republicans on cultural issues, and it would be a fool's errand to try. What they can do is spend the final days of the campaign playing to their strengths : loudly championing the kind of bold populist vision that is actually popular with voters, including African Americans ."

      "text": "More Black Men Went With Trump This Time. I Asked a Few of Them Why.\n\nThe number screamed at me and I actually wanted to yell back at The Washington Post exit poll, or, more specifically, those Minnesota Black male voters who comprised what, initially, looked like a glaring typo. In the state of George Floyd , which helped trigger yet another national awakening to the horror of police treatment of Blacks, 30 percent of Black male voters did the unthinkable. They voted for Donald Trump. It topped all the other states in the poll, with Nevada running second at 21 percent.\n\nI looked again, shaking my head. Then I rushed to google \"Black men in Minnesota.\"\n\nChris Fields, an office manager of a law firm in Minneapolis, is part of that apparent 30 percent. He applauds the figures in the exit poll as a good piece of news for Republicans amidst the long-shot hopes that the president might rescue this election from fraud. Yes, Fields, like many Trump supporters, believes there may be some validity to the president's claims of a stolen election, despite the mountain of credible sources and evidence that says otherwise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2011, Fields, a native New Yorker, settled in the state after retiring as a major in the Marines where he served four tours of duty in Iraq. A year later, he challenged Keith Ellison for his House seat, knowing that the incumbent would prevail in an overwhelmingly Democratic district. Fields merely sought to start a broader conversation locally about the need for Black bipartisanship. Since then, he continued mounting that message throughout the state. In 2020, he steered the focus on converting young Black voters to Trumpism and, for the first time, found a receptive audience.\n\n\"My parents' generation would not hear of voting for a Republican,\" Fields told me. \"Younger generations, mine, my nephews, they are open to hearing a different message. They are more tolerant of listening to different ideas. If you see 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Ice Cube, all those guys do is they give people permission, if you will, to say 'I'll rethink this.'\"\n\nOverall, Biden won 87 percent of the Black vote. However, Trump also increased his share of the Black vote in notable ways. Nationwide, Trump won 19 percent of the Black male vote, up from 13 percent in 2016, and 9 percent of the Black female vote, up from 3 percent four years ago, according to exit polls.\n\nThe rising Black support for Trump in Minnesota could signal growing Black impatience with the perceived failures of white liberalism to rectify racial inequities. Minnesota's entrenched liberal tradition runs deep. It was the one state-along with the District of Columbia-that Walter Mondale won against Ronald Reagan in the Republican landslide in 1984. However the dominance of the Democratic Party lives alongside the state's notorious Black-white gaps in income and education. In Minneapolis, the median Black income in 2018 was $38,000 against $87,000 for whites. This $47,000 gap between the two was one of the largest in the country-second only to Milwaukee. A 2019 Federal Reserve Bank of Minnesota study found the state had one of the worst achievement gaps between Black and white students when it comes to college readiness.\n\nEven Minnesotans who are not Trump fans and voted for Biden comprehend why there was a movement to Trump among some Blacks in the state. \"Let me be clear, there is hard evidence about the incredibly damaging set of policies that Donald Trump has catalyzed in this country,\" says Rose Brewer, a professor of Sociology and African American Studies at the University of Minnesota. \"That can't be rationalized away. However people make sense out of the world in the conditions that they are confronted with. And when you dig very deeply, you see that white liberalism has not been able to unearth the really institutionalized structures of racism here.\"\n\nThe racial disparities helped drive Cecily Davis, who voted for Obama in 2008, to the Republican side in 2012. \"We have to decide what part of this pie do I want and why am I not getting it,\" says Davis, who now chairs Minnesota's chapter of Blexit, the Republican social media campaign geared toward converting Black Democrats to the GOP. \"This causes you to lay down all of the emotion, and ask who's in leadership? Why are we not getting our slice of the pie, and who's in charge of that? That falls on the Democratic side and so it causes you to go to the other side to at least try something different.\"\n\nThabity Willis, director of Africana Studies at Carleton College in Northfield, says when Black voters leave the Democratic Party out of frustration, they enter the GOP with lower expectations. \"There are so many ways that the Democrats don't do what people imagine they should do,\" Willis says. \"Or at least what the establishment does. So in some ways, you can make an argument that people are more critical of the Democrats than they are of the Republicans because they have a higher expectation of the Democrats to begin with.\"\n\nWillis says when Democrats fail to meet the expectations of Black voters, the GOP is ripe as a refuge with an \"anti-status quo\" figure like Trump. \"Like white male Trump supporters,\" he says, \"some Black men might also find something attractive in Trump's anti intellectualism, which resonates with extreme forms of toxic masculinity.\"\n\nThe questions of how and why the minority of Black voters supporting a Republican presidential candidate grew in 2020 resonates beyond Minnesota. Is this just a fluke, or are the hopes of Fields and Davis unfolding into something that will threaten the Democratic lock on the Black vote? The answer to that may lie beyond Trump and be more about Biden and Harris. Will their pivots to broaden their appeals lead to sending the kinds of political gestures to whites or conservative Democrats in ways that alienates Blacks?\n\nVincent Hopkins, an entrepreneur who owns his own insurance and staffing businesses in Washington, D.C., sees Biden and Harris heading toward a \"please everybody\" route that will only produce failure. The result will continue, he believes, to erase some of the loneliness he feels being Black and an avid supporter of Trump and the GOP.\n\nHopkins actually has a lot in common with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. They were classmates at Howard University. Like Harris, he glows with excitement when describing the Howard experience. Yet Hopkins grew in a totally different direction from Harris at Howard, where his attachment to the Republican Party was born. It was then that he realized, he says, that he was the product of parents with conservative values that they abandoned in the voting booth. At Howard, he felt the freedom in the classrooms to argue with his professors that abortion is not just murder: \"It is killing Black babies.\"\n\nToday, he and his wife, Maria, a captain now serving in Iraq as a physician, have a 3-year-old son, Colin, named after General Powell. If they have a daughter, they plan to name her Condoleezza. He thinks many of his good friends suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. \"It means that no matter what Trump does, they hate him,\" says Hopkins. \"Even if he did something good, they hate him. There's nothing he can say or do that they would say good job or I agree with that. I mean it's almost a fanaticism.\"\n\nHopkins concedes he can't escape a tinge of pride in seeing his classmate, Harris, become vice president, but that feeling is far from enough to convert him. And, despite his strong support for Trump, he expects it will be easier for Republicans to make their case to Blacks with someone like Nikki Haley, one of his favorites, on the ticket in 2024.\n\nUnlike Hopkins, Mark Cameron, 54, who lives on the New Jersey shore and manages the service desk at an automobile dealership, is a registered Democrat and relative newcomer to voting for a Republican for president. He sees himself as an independent and moderate Democrat who voted for President Obama in both elections, \"not because he was a Democrat, not because he was Black, but because he was the best man for the job.\" He says that the same criteria-the best candidate running-led him to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 and again in 2020. \"I didn't think that he would be as eloquent and as classy as Barack Obama,\" says Cameron. \"He wasn't going to be a guy who I loved to hear speak. But I didn't vote for him for that. I've always been interested to see what would happen if we took the country out of the hands of a politician and put it in the hands of a businessman. Trump represented to me a possibility.\"\n\nCameron says he voted for Trump in 2020 to see him fulfill his agenda and because Biden and Harris were turnoffs. \"Though I'm a Democrat, I'm not really all that liberal. And quite frankly, there were some statements Biden made that I found a little surprising and could be interpreted as a little racist. He made an analogy about being in chains as an African American male in the United States today. I listened to the full statement and I know what he meant. But I still wouldn't expect any white guy to say that. Kind of turned me off. And then the statement about 'you're not Black if you don't vote for me.' That's not a statement that I would expect a white candidate to say when you're talking to the minority community. I almost feel, from my standpoint, that he's taken the Black vote for granted.\"\n\nBack in Minnesota, some Black voters clearly rejected the notion that Trump bore any responsibility for the discord after the murder of George Floyd by police. \"Policing is a local issue,\" Fields says. \"The Democrats have nationalized it as if Donald Trump can make a phone call and anything in that police department can change.\"\n\nFields even goes a step further and blames Democrats for the longevity of the careers of the officers responsible for Floyd's death, such as Derek Chauvin. \"The person who decided not to prosecute three of them was our own senator, Amy Klobuchar, when she was the Hennepin County District Attorney,\" Fields says. \"What I would say here is that the Democrats showed their true colors then and in allowing neighborhoods to be burned, and by allowing that precinct to be burned. They're not interested in protecting us.\"\n\nThe resistance to seeing the relationship between racism and Trumpism also appears to shape the perceptions of Trump supporters in Minnesota's large community of African immigrants. Minnesota has the largest Somalian community in the nation, in addition to more than 10,000 Ethiopian immigrants in the Minneapolis-St Paul area. While the exit polls did not differentiate between immigrants and native-born African Americans, both professors Brewer and Willis suspect that the Black immigrant population may play a role in the spike of Black voters for Trump. \"It is harder for them to understand institutional racism,\" says Professor Willis, \"And oftentimes they have consumed global media and the negative depictions of African Americans as well before coming here.  They have a distance with other Black and minority communities. To some degree, the gospel of the Republican center and right, the rugged individualism and bootstrapism, resonates with them because of their experience of picking up and transporting themselves here.\"\n\nAyano Jiru, a Trump-backing Ethiopian immigrant in Minneapolis, says he was the lone voter for Trump in 2016 among his family of 21, which includes his siblings, parents, cousins, and uncles. He has spent the last four years promoting Trump in his family and community. In the family group chat on election day this year, he discovered the results of his lobbying-16 of the 21 family members voted for Trump.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "CDC: Half of Gay Black Men Will Get HIV\n\nHalf of gay and bisexual black men and a quarter of gay and bisexual Hispanic men will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetimes, the Centers for Disease Control announced in a first-of-its-kind study on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the lifetime risk of a positive HIV diagnosis has fallen from 1 in 78 Americans overall in 2005 to 1 in 99 today, the decline has not been distributed equally among the U.S. population. For the foreseeable future, the CDC estimates that gay, bisexual, black and Hispanic people will continue to bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic. The new study is the first time that the CDC has estimated lifetime HIV risk based on race.\n\nOverall, the CDC projected that one in 64 men and one in 227 women in the United States will be diagnosed with HIV at current rates. For black and Hispanic people, however, that risk increases dramatically.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRegardless of sexual orientation, one in 20 black men and one in 48 black women will be diagnosed with the virus that causes AIDS in their lifetimes, according to the CDC. For Hispanic men and women, the risks are one in 48 and one in 227, respectively.\n\nWhite people have the lowest chance of an HIV diagnosis, with an overall lifetime risk of less than one percent. Gay and bisexual white men still have a lifetime risk of one in 11, though.\n\nThe CDC's projections are based on data about HIV diagnoses and death rates collected from 2009 to 2013, and they assume that rates of new diagnoses remain constant. If that's the case, one in six men who have sex with other men will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetimes.\n\n\"These estimates are a sobering reminder that gay and bisexual men face an unacceptably high risk for HIV-and of the urgent need for action,\" said Dr. Eugene McCray, director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. \"If we work to ensure that every American has access to the prevention tools we know work, we can avoid the outcomes projected in this study.\"\n\nFor Hispanic people living in the United States, the CDC has already outlined an array of factors behind the alarming rate of new infections: a high prevalence of HIV, poverty and lack of health insurance coverage, \"machismo\" that can encourage men to engage in risky sexual behavior as a show of strength, and reluctance to access prevention services for fear of revealing one's immigration status.\n\nIn South Florida , for example, an already high prevalence of HIV has combined with low awareness of the virus and social stigma to produce the highest rate of new infections in the U.S., driven largely by new infections among young Hispanic men .\n\nFor black people, CDC resources show, prevention challenges are similar : poverty, stigma, barriers to health care access, and too few people knowing their status. Risk in black communities is especially high, the CDC notes, because \"African Americans tend to have sex with partners of the same race/ethnicity mean[ing] that [they] face a greater risk of HIV infection with each new sexual encounter.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC's new projections, all of the states with the highest lifetime risk for HIV are in the South, with the exceptions of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and the District of Columbia. All of these states and the South tend to have large black and Hispanic populations, higher rates of poverty, and less health-insurance coverage.\n\nThe CDC estimates that HIV risk is highest in Maryland, Georgia, Louisiana, and Florida, with about 2 percent of these states' populations believed to test HIV positive eventually.\n\nNo single area may be worst-hit than Washington, D.C., which is nearly 50 percent black and 10 percent Latino. According to the CDC's projections, a staggering one in 13 D.C. residents will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetimes.\n\nBut the CDC doesn't want its projections to be interpreted as a death sentence.\n\n\"As alarming as these lifetime risk estimates are, they are not a foregone conclusion. They are a call to action,\" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention.\n\nIf the U.S. can reduce new infections, those lifetime risk numbers will go down, too. The CDC's current prevention approach emphasizes HIV testing, condom use, treatment for those who have already been diagnosed, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily medication that has been shown to reduce risk by more than 90 percent when used correctly.\n\n\"The prevention and care strategies we have at our disposal today provide a promising outlook for future reductions of HIV infections and disparities in the U.S.,\" said Dr. Mermin, \"but hundreds of thousands of people will be diagnosed in their lifetime if we don't scale up efforts now.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How the Well Dressed Movement Demolished Black Stereotypes\n\nI met Kwame Phipps five years ago, at the end of his junior year in high school, through a Harlem-based youth development organization to help him apply to college. He was always neatly dressed and attentive to his grooming. So I am not surprised he would become a founder of the Well Dressed Movement at Syracuse University to promote better dress habits among his peers.\n\nOne reason I volunteered to mentor students like Kwame is that media portrayals of young black men have burdened them with numerous disquieting stereotypes . Like many stereotypes people affix to particular groups, they are highly simplistic and often neglect larger societal issues that produce and perpetuate misperceptions. Such perceptions prove harmful to nearly all black men. Young men like Phipps are often overlooked in such generalizations, so he and his friends have taken conscious steps to dispel negative myths.\n\nPhipps, a 2016 Syracuse graduate, and his roommates, Joshua Collins and Elijah Biggins, started the Well Dressed Movement as a direct effort to counter some misperceptions. In 2014, their sophomore year, each had dressed up one day, but Phipps said, \"It was random. I had an internship, Josh had a job interview, and Eli had a class presentation.\" Unaware each had dressed up, \"we left our apartment at different times and met later at the library for a social. Everyone saw us and asked why we were dressed up. We pretended it was intentional and said it was \"Well Dressed Wednesday.\" From there, they decided to make a Wednesday tradition of dressing up and enlisted their friends to join them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey began the Well Dressed Movement in the wake of high profile killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown , and college campuses were rife with discussion about race. Syracuse was no different. Phipps said there was extensive racist dialogue in online articles in the school newspaper, The Daily Orange , and on Yik Yak , a location-based social media platform popular on college campuses.\n\n\"My friends and I are from inner city Philadelphia, Paterson (New Jersey), and New York City,\" and they felt the sting of such commentary. Dressing up was a constructive response to address perceptions others might have about them. They took inspiration from earlier black pioneers who tackled social justice issues. The group's motto, When you look good, you feel good, facilitated engagement with their peers. Their movement took hold and spread to other campuses, including Binghamton, Cornell, Howard, and Pace universities and Utica College, which validated their efforts.\n\nLooking good takes money, however.

      "text": "'If Beale Street Could Talk' Director Barry Jenkins on America's Ugly History of 'Preying on Young Black Men'\n\nBarry Jenkins is in a good mood-this despite the blustery weather and endless shuffle of bodies swarming around the JW Marriott Essex House in Manhattan. It's early December and he's in the midst of a major media blitz. The bustle of a late-in-the-year press run-up to Oscar season is not for the faint of heart or those with short attention spans, and Jenkins has faced the media gauntlet over the past few weeks. But his enthusiasm is palpable, and when we sit down to discuss critical buzz, Baldwin and Beale Street , he sounds like a man who is fully immersed in what he has done and what he is doing.\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk , his gorgeous adaptation of James Baldwin's 1974 novel, has received widespread acclaim. It centers on Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny ( Stephan James ), two lovebirds in 1970s Harlem. When Fonny is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, a pregnant Tish does everything in her power to clear his name. The film's arrived two years after his Oscar-winning drama Moonlight , which announced Jenkins as one of the defining filmmakers of our time.\n\nJenkins' propensity for depicting the vulnerability of Black manhood stands out, and he recognizes the power of allowing Black men to be whole-to show the love and the warmth that defines so much of our experiences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It is important for me,\" he states. \"It's not my choice; both of these last two films are adaptations. Tarell Alvin McCraney has chosen to present black men in their full humanity, and James Baldwin has chosen to present Black men in their full humanity. Those things were gifted to me, and it is important to show that this is a feature, not a bug. I'm very keen on saying 'that's not the point.' This is one of the points. It was a point in Moonlight , it's definitely a point in Beale Street . If you're continually ingesting all of this imagery of Black men where they're denied their full humanity, then you start to believe, 'Are Black men human? Do they feel things the way everyone else feel things?' I think it's very important, and to be brutally honest, I think when the actors walk onto the sets it's important to them, also.\"\n\nThat clarity of vision binds his two most well-known projects, as well as his indie debut Medicine for Melancholy ; he offers a richly nuanced approach to intimacy, and a commitment to expressive Blackness onscreen.\n\n\"It felt like that was a function of the [ Beale Street ] novel, too,\" he explains, \"almost how by presenting the [relationship] between the joy and the suffering. But I do think the presentation of one does not necessarily mean the absence of the other, and I think in Beale Street , in particular, the joy between Tish and Fonny is almost in defiance of the despair and the suffering they experience. And I think whatever reason, in the art that we've been presented that's made it into the commercial realm or the public zeitgeist, there has always been one or the other. There hasn't been this very grounded depiction of both and there have been few grounded depictions of both where there isn't this direct corollary between one or the other.\"\n\n\"I feel like in our adaptation, we wanted to build an aesthetic contract where the joy could exist on its own and it could be grounded in a reality and not have any direct relation to the more miserable or despaired or tortuous aspects of the story, as well.\"\n\nIt's not a bad time to be Barry Jenkins. The 39-year old filmmaker has one of the year's most praised films. That he finds himself alongside a generation of Black filmmakers who are reshaping mainstream American cinema is something in which the director takes a specific pride.\n\n\"I'm not the first person to do these things, certainly-that would be hella disrespectful to the work Spike [Lee] has done over the last two-and-a-half decades,\" Jenkins acknowledges. \"But the films I've made have somehow found themselves in the public zeitgeist, they found themselves in the commercial zeitgeist and in the critical zeitgeist. Because of that, people are actually seeing these men. I've been trying to understand how and why that's happened. But I think that through the work of people like Ava [DuVernay], Jordan [Peele], Spike, and websites like Shadow and Act, Blavity-there are just so many of these places where people are gathering and go, 'Yeah, we're not going to accept anything less than the full depiction, the full humanity.'\"\n\nA Black creative operating within the mainstream has to be aware of the potential double-edged sword that can come from establishment adulation. Whatever cynicism expressed is often justified; there have been those who were upheld as \"the voice\" for Black cinema in the past, only to find their opportunities dwindling and their stature diminished once gatekeepers move on to the hot new voice. But Jenkins isn't preoccupied with any bubble bursting or any lofty appraisals by tastemakers.\n\n\"I had it before with Medicine ,\" he admits. \"And I did nothing with it. [ Laughs ] Not that I did nothing , but the more I listened to the buzz, the more I got away from myself-thus, it was eight years between [my first and second] films. So I just take it off the table. I'm just a guy telling stories.\"\n\n\"And here's the thing: back then in 2008, it was a whole different landscape. Now? It's like 'Black critical darling ?' Like, singular? What does that mean? There's like eight thousand of us now! So this need for a Black critical darling, to me, doesn't exist. So let's take it off the table and continue to make great work.\"\n\nJenkins is happy to stand among the aforementioned filmmakers and others who have made waves in recent years. From the popcorn blockbuster ( Black Panther ) to the historical drama ( Selma ) to the topical thriller ( Get Out ) and action-suspense ( Widows ), there has been a widening that feels long overdue. There is no unicorn of Black cinema currently, and Jenkins believes that's been the goal all along: a broader palette of creative voices being seen and heard on the most visible platforms.\n\n\"I'm extremely encouraged,\" he says. \"I think about it from the top to the bottom. At the top, you have a movie with a ninety-percent Black cast that grossed 8.5 bajillion dollars! And then way down low, you have this young woman named Nijla Mu'min, who used to be a critic. I knew her as an up-and-coming filmmaker who had a film breakout at SXSW. A small film called Jinn . Whenever it's not just at the top, but you can go through the entire strata and see people doing interesting work in their own voices, hell yeah , that's encouraging. And it's not just me, someone who is within the system, who can see all of these things; I think audience can see it as well, which, to be honest, is even more important.\"\n\nThe moviegoing audience of 2018 is more connected and vocal than 25 years ago, and just as those factors have led to some of the changes we've seen, there is also a recognition that people being more aware means that these changes can and should run much deeper.\n\n\"There were moments where there were clusters around Spike, but you go back over the past 30 years, he's the one constant,\" Jenkins says. \"I think for Spike it must be gratifying and I think he should be proud that all the weight he carried for those decades-it wasn't for naught. Now I'm sure he looks around like, 'Oh shit-twenty years from now all of these muthafuckas are gonna still be working, still telling their stories!' Maybe twenty years ago, he couldn't look around and say the same thing.\"\n\nLike so much of his work, Baldwin's story of young lovers offers an indictment of American culture-how far any semblance of actual \"justice\" seems when one is fixed within a racist American system. To call Beale Street \"timely\" would ignore how its themes have played continuously for Black folks in America.\n\n\"I think the real question is, if the book were set in 1954, then what would it be?\" Jenkins offers. \"It's horrific in its 'present' setting of the early '70s. Can you imagine? What are we talking about? Then we're talking about Emmett Till. When are we going to do something about this? And what I mean is, when are we going to really take the legalization of preying on young Black men-as far as sentencing codes, due process, public defenders-when are we going to really take a look at how these things operate?\"\n\nKiKi Layne and Stephan James star in 'If Beale Street Could Talk'\n\n\"Maybe things are beginning to change. I just saw that the officer who murdered Botham Jean will actually be tried for murder. So maybe there is progress, because five years ago I don't know if that would be the case. Five years ago, we're talking about Trayvon Martin. We're talking about Tamir Rice.\"\n\nThose tragedies and a litany of others were catalysts that sparked a call to action for a generation coming into itself. Alongside the social unrest and presidential shift from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, there has been a wave of topical Black art and entertainment-much of it by voices that have risen to the fore telling stories of what's happening and what has happened in the Black American experience.\n\nJenkins believes that his work has found its way into peoples' consciousness-and that is the ultimate goal of any storyteller. They want you to see the world they've created through their characters' eyes, and so often Black experience has been depicted through an outside lens, or heavily influenced by outside perspectives. Jenkins has found a wide audience by drawing you into a world that exists within itself and showing that world's wide array of textures. It's why he's become such a favorite-but it's also why he thinks this is bigger than accolades. That his work resonates in a way that connects our experiences is what matters.\n\n\"I'm always surprised-not necessarily when people respond positively, because that's something I can't control, but when the audience is experiencing the film through the perspective that you hoped they would, which is through our main characters, when they're actually empathizing and identifying with what they're going through,\" Jenkins concedes when asked about all the love his films have received. \"That, to me, is always a pleasant surprise. So for me, it's been very heartening, because at the very least what I see in it is this was all about harnessing the power and energy of James Baldwin and giving it to the audience. And I think from top to bottom, that was our chief hope.\"\n\nThat hope has been realized via the compelling art Jenkins creates. His greatest successes have been cinematic interpretations of existing works: Baldwin's Beale Street and Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue , and both works served to illuminate the humanity of Black love, pain and identity. In Jenkins' Beale Street , he highlights the family's reaction to 19-year-old Tish announcing that she's expecting a baby with her incarcerated boyfriend Fonny in a way that is illustrative of how Berry Jenkins sees that humanity.\n\n\"I thought it was important to introduce the circumstances of Tish and Fonny's human situation before introducing the 'weight of the world,' in a certain way,\" he explains. \"There's different kinds of weight. Even if he's not awaiting trial, the announcement of this baby would still be a seismic act. What you're watching in the first 30 minutes is what should be the family drama, but the system of this entrapment and this damn officer, now this places an extra burden. Life is difficult in and of itself, and imagine being a young Black man who an extremely empowered cop has decided, 'You know what? You .' So to me it's like, let's just set up in the first 30 minutes the dynamics of this love and this family and this life and that would be enough drama to sustain a whole narrative. And then imagine now you gotta deal with this shit. That's what it's like to be Black in America.\"\n\nstereowilliams@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Harris Pledges to Help Black Men by Legalizing Marijuana\n\nVice President Kamala Harris promised to legalize recreational marijuana use at the federal level if elected president, her campaign announced as part of a slate of new policy promises Monday.\n\nRecreational cannabis is currently legal in 24 states, but has remained illegal federally, often leading to a contentious clash between overlapping laws.\n\nThe announcement was made alongside new policies the Harris campaign said form an \"Opportunity Agenda\" for Black men, and are designed to appeal to the important voting bloc that traditionally votes overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the case of marijuana legalization, Black Americans have long been disproportionately arrested, targeted and punished by law enforcement and the judiciary for marijuana and other drug-related offenses.\n\nAccording to FBI data , U.S. law enforcement agencies made roughly 217,000 arrests for marijuana-related offenses last year. Black Americans, who make up 13.7 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 29 percent of drug arrests, according to the same data. Research also shows Black Americans are convicted at higher rates, and given longer sentences, in criminal cases.\n\n\"Vice President Harris will break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back by legalizing marijuana nationally, working with Congress to ensure that the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana is the law of the land,\" said the Harris campaign, in a press release.\n\nThe campaign added that Harris will \"fight to ensure that as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.\" Notably, data has shown that Black entrepreneurs and workers have frequently been shut out of the cannabis industry as it has emerged across the country as it has become legalized.\n\nThe vice president is expected to detail the legalization plan alongside other policies in Erie, Pennsylvania Monday.\n\nOther announcements made as part of the appeal to Black men include one million fully forgivable loans up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs, training and mentorship programs to help Black men enter \"high-demand\" industries, financial support to Black ranchers and farmers including those who were discriminated against by banks and federal loan programs, and a national initiative focused on health issues that disproportionately impact Black men, such as prostate cancer and sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile Harris maintains a commanding lead among Black voters, recent polls have shown her lagging behind historic numbers.\n\nA New York Times/Siena poll found Harris had the support of 78 percent of Black voters. In past elections, Democratic candidates for president have won over 90 percent support from Black voters, including President Joe Biden who received 92 percent in 2020.\n\nWhile in office, former president Donald Trump , Harris' Republican opponent in the election, threatened a crackdown on states that had legalized marijuana before backing down. He has since softened his stance on weed, and supports a ballot measure that would legalize recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How the Well Dressed Movement Demolished Black Stereotypes\n\nI met Kwame Phipps five years ago, at the end of his junior year in high school, through a Harlem-based youth development organization to help him apply to college. He was always neatly dressed and attentive to his grooming. So I am not surprised he would become a founder of the Well Dressed Movement at Syracuse University to promote better dress habits among his peers.\n\nOne reason I volunteered to mentor students like Kwame is that media portrayals of young black men have burdened them with numerous disquieting stereotypes . Like many stereotypes people affix to particular groups, they are highly simplistic and often neglect larger societal issues that produce and perpetuate misperceptions. Such perceptions prove harmful to nearly all black men. Young men like Phipps are often overlooked in such generalizations, so he and his friends have taken conscious steps to dispel negative myths.\n\nPhipps, a 2016 Syracuse graduate, and his roommates, Joshua Collins and Elijah Biggins, started the Well Dressed Movement as a direct effort to counter some misperceptions. In 2014, their sophomore year, each had dressed up one day, but Phipps said, \"It was random. I had an internship, Josh had a job interview, and Eli had a class presentation.\" Unaware each had dressed up, \"we left our apartment at different times and met later at the library for a social. Everyone saw us and asked why we were dressed up. We pretended it was intentional and said it was \"Well Dressed Wednesday.\" From there, they decided to make a Wednesday tradition of dressing up and enlisted their friends to join them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey began the Well Dressed Movement in the wake of high profile killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown , and college campuses were rife with discussion about race. Syracuse was no different. Phipps said there was extensive racist dialogue in online articles in the school newspaper, The Daily Orange , and on Yik Yak , a location-based social media platform popular on college campuses.\n\n\"My friends and I are from inner city Philadelphia, Paterson (New Jersey), and New York City,\" and they felt the sting of such commentary. Dressing up was a constructive response to address perceptions others might have about them. They took inspiration from earlier black pioneers who tackled social justice issues. The group's motto, When you look good, you feel good, facilitated engagement with their peers. Their movement took hold and spread to other campuses, including Binghamton, Cornell, Howard, and Pace universities and Utica College, which validated their efforts.\n\nLooking good takes money, however. As budget-conscious millennials, they shopped at H&M, Zara, local thrift stores, and they tracked sale items at Macy's. It was worth the effort. Phipps said dressing up without a specific purpose elicited positive responses from those with whom he interacted, and it instilled a professional mindset in him.\n\n\"Dressing up on campus prepped me for interviews,\" he said. \"I already had the pieces, so I didn't have to think about it too much.

      "text": "Will America's Fear of Black Men Ever Go Away?\n\nThis weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, Jonathan Ferrell was shot to death by law enforcement while looking for help after a car accident.\n\nFerrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M football player, crashed his car early Saturday morning. After climbing out, he ran to a nearby home for help. The resident, a woman waiting for her husband, opened the door and-realizing it wasn't him-closed it. She then called 911 to report a man trying to break into her home. Three officers arrived and found Ferrell about a block from the house. During the encounter, according to the police report, Ferrell ran toward them and at least one opened fire, killing him.\n\nFerrell joins a long, tragic list. This March, for instance, Kimani Gray was shot to death by officers in Brooklyn, New York, after he was confronted for \"suspicious behavior.\" A year before, in New Orleans, Wendell Allen, 20, was killed in his home by police executing a search warrant for marijuana. And Kendrec McDade, 19, was killed while running from police in Pasadena, California, after he was falsely accused of attempted theft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, it's tempting to say race has nothing to do with this-that it was a tragic accident, borne of fear and misunderstanding. After all, there's no evidence of intentional bias; just a young man in the wrong place, at the wrong time. But racism is a cultural force as much as it is a series of beliefs, and as such, it bears on our subconscious as much as it does our actions. For Americans, race has a strong pull on our sense of fear and our perceptions of aggression , a fact that has more to do with the legacy of slavery and our long history of racial demonization than it does any particular set of crime statistics. And in particular, according to a range of surveys and implicit association tests-which measure unconscious bias by flashing faces and soliciting responses-white Americans are more afraid of black men than any other group in the country.\n\nIn one such test ( PDF ), researchers found that black males elicited the most negative reactions from white subjects-simply seeing them was enough to make participants feel uncomfortable. And in a 2009 survey on the question of blacks and violence , drawn from a nationally representative sample of white Americans, more than 30 percent said that blacks were more violent than whites. Respondents were also asked specifically about violence among black men versus white men, black women, and white women. The results? More than 40 percent said that \"many\" or \"almost all\" black men were violent, compared to less than 20 percent who said the same of black women or white men, and less than 10 percent who said the same of white women.\n\nNo doubt these conscious biases are fed by stories such as that of Aaron Alexis, the man suspected of killing 11 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.\n\nWith all of this in mind, let's return to the Ferrell shooting, with the reality of unconscious bias in mind. When Ferrell knocked on the door, asking for help, did the woman see an injured young man, dazed and confused from a car accident? Or did she see someone who would harm her if she didn't take action? Judging from her decision to call the police and report the incident as an attempted burglary, my guess is the latter. It's one thing to ask for police assistance-there's a good chance I would have done the same-it's something else to assume malign intent. Likewise, when the police confronted Ferrell, did they see someone who needed assistance, or did they assume-instinctively-that the young black man coming towards them was a threat to be neutralized?\n\nI think we know the answer.\n\nNone of this is to say that the men and women responsible for Ferrell's death are racists . There's no way to know what lives in their hearts, but my guess is that they aren't the reincarnations of Bull Connor. They don't have to be; this is just how racism works. The idea that African Americans are prone to violence has a long pedigree, from antebellum fears of slave revolts, to the 1890s , when white supremacist scholars took crime statistics and twisted them into \"proof\" of inherent black criminality.\n\nWhich is to say that, in writing about Jonathan Ferrell, I've tried to imagine a situation that doesn't end with his death. I can't. Fear of black men has a tremendous hold on the American subconscious, and it mixes with our perceptions in ways that guarantee tragedy. As a nation, it's one of our deadliest problems, and I'm not sure we can fix it.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

As black as I am.\" The script is based on interviews with hundreds of gay and bisexual men from Jackson, Mississippi , and Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe production-a collaboration between Harley & Co, a NYC-based creative studio, and ViiV Healthcare-uses neon lights and sprinkles of glitter to amplify emotion and exaggerate reality. Each scene shifts in color to create new moods and places. The bedroom is a rich, warm yellow-amber, depicting where characters feel safest. In contrast, the clinic is an icy blue, because characters face stigma regarding their health status at the doctor's office.\n\nBlack gay and bisexual men are more affected by HIV and face more disparities in treatment than any group in the United States , according to the CDC . In the south, the stakes are even higher. Nearly 44 percent of all people living with an HIV diagnosis in the U.S. live in the south.\n\nSouthern black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted, the CDC reports . African-American men make up at least 54 percent of new HIV diagnoses. The CDC reports that general discomfort around queer sexuality in the south, along with socioeconomic factors like poverty and income inequality, play a role in whether people will seek preventative treatment.\n\nHall said in pop culture black people with HIV are often regulated to the past.\n\n\"It looks at what happened 10 or 20 years ago,\" Hall said. \"I think that's misleading, potentially for audiences and doesn't communicate how present it is and how immediate it is.\" She added, \"Also, in many of those shows the actors are white or are not black.\"\n\n\"From the beginning, it's been hidden and silenced more so in the black community-and it shouldn't be. It should be equal attention and visibility.\"\n\nThe play began from a startling CDC statistic. Three years ago, the CDC revealed that if infection rates don't change by 2020, one in two black men who have sex with men in America will be infected with HIV in their lifetime.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic hits close to home for Hall. When she was a child, her uncle died with the disease.\n\n\"I remember it very vividly him being sick and how scary it was,\" she said. \"He was my guardian angel. He helped me go to school in New York, which ended up being theater school and that's how I connected to the people who are part of the production.\"\n\nIn honor of her late relative, the actors say her uncle's name \"Chuck\" in the show.\n\n\"Had he been alive he would have been devastated by what's happening,\" Hall said. \"He would have wanted to fight for all men who are part of the community.\"\n\nActor Jason Veasey, who plays the pastor, said the production acts as a form of outreach.\n\n\"I know so many people in my life who are HIV positive,\" Veasey said. \"We know how people can contract the virus, but I don't think we pay enough attention to stigma and shame. That can directly affect how someone takes care of themselves.\"\n\n\"We cannot have these statistics where black gay men are having this level of infection given the standard of care that is available,\" Hall said. \"We have to support black gay men.\" She added, \"There is no reason that the shame and stigma that exists should be persistent.\"\n\n\"You might be a straight white man who comes to the show, but you can understand how challenging it is to negotiate intimacy with a partner and how power dynamics can be very complicated,\" Hall said. \"That can be a way to say, 'I understand and have felt these things too.'\"\n\nAs Much As I Can is at Joe's Pub, NYC, Sept. 12 to 16.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Here's How Black Men Have Already Won the 2024 Election\n\nMy entire adult life-much of which I've spent covering politics-I've wondered what it must feel like to be one of those voters candidates try desperately to win over. As a Black woman I've never experienced this, because both major parties just assume I'm voting for a Democrat. After this election, however, that may no longer be the case. And that's thanks to Black men.\n\nBefore liberal Twitter melts down, yes, I know Democrats have spent billions of dollars targeting Black voters over the years. But those dollars are usually focused on \"turnout.\" The thinking goes: everyone knows who Black Americans vote for; the only question mark is how many of them will show up at the polls. No one treats the white working class that way. Political operatives spend countless hours trying to find ways to appeal to \"Reagan Democrats\" and their heir apparent, \"Obama-turned-Trump voters.\" Then there's always those \"soccer moms\" in the burbs who we're told can sway an election.\n\nBut guess who can sway an election too?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBlack Americans. We've just rarely been treated that way-until now. After this election, we should be, thanks to polling and predictions that Donald Trump will win more Black votes than previous GOP candidates, and more Black men's votes in particular.\n\nFor all of the outrage directed at Barack Obama over his comments chastising lackluster Black male support for Kamala Harris , more should be directed at the Democratic Party as a whole . Democrats would never have the audacity to say to any other group, \"I don't have to tell you what we'll do for you. All I have to tell you is that I'm not the other guy and that should be enough. Okay?\" And yet this has long been considered an acceptable strategy for Black voter outreach-particularly if Black candidates are running.\n\nThat strategy has hit a speed bump this election cycle for a few reasons. The most obvious one is that, despite dire warnings about Donald Trump's racist past -whether in his treatment of Black tenants , his campaign against the Central Park Five or even his non-plussed, \"lovefest\" response to the rhetoric at this past weekend's rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden-it turned out his first term as president was not the second coming of Reconstruction. Trump nominated conservative Supreme Court justices hostile to civil rights measures, but we also know that any Republican president have done the same. He continued to make racially offensive comments, but the truth is if you're a minority, you know some powerful people say horrible things about people like you. They just usually have the decorum and intelligence to hide it.\n\nIn essence, Trump turned out not to be the Klan hood-wearing bogeyman that I and many others had feared-rather, just a regular conservative bogeyman.\n\nSo while many voters-and many Black voters-will look at Trump and see a bad man, the fact is that if no one voted for bad, or women, the halls of Congress would be sparse.\n\nWhat seems to be unnerving Democrats is that Black Americans are beginning to focus on issues that matter to them as individuals, not simply issues they have been told should matter to everyone who looks like them. Democrats know this is bad because a number of the issues Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz are struggling to connect with voters on are ones that impact Black people more than others.\n\nIt's hard to channel rage about someone's rhetoric, no matter how crass, if you are having trouble putting food on the table or gas in the car due to inflation. Illegal immigration strains resources in cities with large Black communities; furor over trans athletes' inclusion in collegiate sports (and the silencing by liberals of even reasonable queries on this issue) has the potential to impact Black Americans who rely on athletic scholarships as a pathway to higher education-and the middle class. People already struggling to hang on to a lower rung of the economic ladder don't implicitly hate others trying to get on the ladder themselves. They simply fear that at some point the ladder will break-because it will.\n\nBlack Americans have a complicated history with political labels. For decades, many identified as Republicans since that was the party of Lincoln, and his role in ending slavery was a pretty solid reason to inspire loyalty. But Southern Democrats who broke ranks in the Civil Rights era and joined the GOP establishment resulted in a seismic shift in Black Americans' party allegiance. People like my parents, who grew up under segregation, had good reason to trust the party of LBJ over what became the party of Strom Thurmond.\n\nDecades later, research on younger Black voters conducted with famed pollster (and my former professor) David Paleologos, for my 2008 book, Party Crashing , found nearly a third of younger Black voters identified as Independents. But then Obama ran for President. So it's possible we are not seeing a shift inspired by Trump, but one that has been brewing for a long time-Obama just slowed it. Why wouldn't he? You'd be hard-pressed to find a more perfect presidential candidate. He's one of the most gifted speakers, and speechwriters, to grace the Oval Office. He had a compelling personal narrative that connected with Black elites and the white working class. Most of all, he had his wife. Michelle Obama is who many Black women want to be-and who many Black men want by their side, because she's the kind of woman whose own greatness can inspire a community organizer to become President.\n\nKamala Harris does not have the above going for her. She's an adequate candidate, but no Obama-nor is she Ketanji Brown Jackson , who is on the Supreme Court because she's practically perfect. And as far as we have come as a society, we are not far enough that imperfect women and racial minorities get the same benefit of the doubt that men like Trump and Bill Clinton do.\n\nAll of this brings me to why we should be applauding Black men this election cycle instead of condemning them. They are voting on what matters to them-not simply out of fear, like a lot of Black Americans, myself included, have been conditioned to. In my opinion, this is what true freedom looks like.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

We speak with Jacqueline Olive, director of \"Always in Season,\" a documentary that examines the history of lynchings through the story of Lennon Lacy, an African American teenager who was found hanged from a swing set in 2014. \"They deserve a full investigation,\" Olive says of the recent hangings, \"and given the context of this history ... that we look at them more than three days, and then that they are looked at as a whole.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman. Amidst mass protests against racism and police brutality across the country, at least five men - four Black and one Latinx - have been found hanging in public across the United States in recent weeks. All five deaths were initially deemed suicides, but community advocates, scholars and those all too familiar with America's racist history say there's another possibility: lynching.\n\nIn Palmdale, California, authorities are investigating the death of 24-year-old Robert Fuller, a Black man who was found dead, hanged from a tree near the community's City Hall earlier this month. City officials said he died by suicide, suggesting the cause was due to mental anguish related to the coronavirus pandemic. But Fuller's loved ones believe he was lynched, and the community has been holding protests calling for justice. A week after Fuller was found hanged, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot and killed his brother, Terron Boone, in what authorities described as a shootout in a desert town near Palmdale.\n\nRobert Fuller's death came 10 days after another Black man, 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch, was found hanged from a tree about 50 miles away, in Victorville, California, May 31st. After calling for further investigation, Malcolm Harsch's family said over the weekend that his death was in fact a suicide and that they had reviewed video footage the police provided. Community activists are still asking why it took so long for a thorough investigation into his death.\n\nIn New York, the New York Police Department is investigating the death of Dominique Alexander, a 27-year-old Black man who was found hanged in a Manhattan park two weeks ago. The local Medical Examiner's Office ruled the cause of his death suicide.\n\nAnd in Texas, Congressmember Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston is calling for an investigation after two recent hangings. Last week, police found a 17-year-old Black boy hanging from a tree in an elementary school playground in Spring, Texas. Earlier that week, a Latinx man was found hanged in Houston.\n\nThis all comes as a noose was found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace, the only African American driver in NASCAR's elite Cup Series. Wallace recently led a successful campaign to get NASCAR to ban displays of Confederate flags from its events.\n\nWell, for more on this topic, we're going to Durham, North Carolina, to speak with Jacqueline Olive, director of a film called Always in Season . It's a devastating documentary that examines the history of lynchings in the United States through the story of Lennon Lacy, an African American teenager who was found hanged from a swing set in 2014. His mother, Claudia Lacy, believes he was lynched. Always in Season premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2019. Well, we're going to go to Jacqueline in a minute, but first, this is the film's trailer. A warning to our audience: This clip contains violent and racist imagery.\n\n911 DISPATCHER : You said there's a male suspect hanging from a swing?\n\nCALLER : It's a Black male subject.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : I think they hung him up to make it look like a suicide.\n\nPIERRE LACY : It looked like a \"back in the day\" lynching.\n\nDANNY GLOVER : His body would be hung in the courthouse square for all to see. All white folks are invited to the party.\n\nSHERRILYN IFILL : Lynching was a message crime. They happened in places where the body would be seen. And it's the public nature of lynching that really condemns the white community, because the idea that people didn't know - they did know.\n\nHEATHER RATTELADE : As I started researching Black males committing suicide in public over the last few years, I became quite concerned that there may be a bigger, surreptitious movement at play here.\n\nREPORTER : The caption: \"Last night pic before the game.\"\n\nCLAUDIA LACY : That does not sound like a person that was planning on killing himself.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was the trailer for Always in Season .\n\nJacqueline Olive, we welcome you back to Democracy Now! , under horrible circumstances of one death after another, young African American men hanging from trees in the United States, not 100 or 200 years ago, but in these last weeks. Can you talk about the significance of this? Now, again, family members are not saying absolutely they know what happened in each case, as was the case in the particular hanging you looked at in Always in Season , but they are demanding answers and serious investigations. Can you start off with the Palmdale hanging in California?\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : Absolutely. So, these hangings really come out of a climate in the White House in which there is intense vitriol and hatred that's being messaged, and people are being energized and activated around those messages. You have militia groups that are activated in increasing numbers. You have increasing numbers of noose incidents, including the one that was found in Oakland, California, last week, incidents in which people are being threatened - Black people are being threatened with nooses.\n\nAnd so, as this climate escalates and you have these hanging deaths that are incredibly alarming, then the first question that Black folks often have is whether or not there was lynching involved. And so, it is really important that when local officials come out to investigate these cases, that they frame their investigation and they frame their look at the evidence in this history, with historic lynchings, but also around the racial violence and division that's going on currently.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you have Robert Fuller, who was found hanged outside of City Hall in Palmdale. And then you have Malcolm Harsch, like 60 miles away, found hung near the public library in Victorville.\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, the police departments in both these cases immediately closed the investigations and said that it was suicide. It took enormous pressure from activists in Victorville and the family to finally actually see video that the police had, that showed, in fact, Malcolm Harsch, it did look like he had taken his own life. That isn't the case for Robert Fuller at this point. We don't know what's happened. And then you have these latest hangings of Black and Brown people: Wednesday, police found 17-year-old African American teen hanging from a tree, elementary school playground in Spring, Texas; on Monday, a Latinx man found hanged in Houston. And then one here in New York City. So, talk further about how people can know what police assume and what the history is.\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : Sure. Well, typical of this case, and it was certainly the case with Lennon Lacy, that I researched really thoroughly as we filmed, is that the police generally show up, and they show up within three days or so, and they've made their conclusion of suicide. What they don't take into account is this history or the family's concerns deeply enough that there might have been a lynching and that their family member may have met violence.\n\nAnd so, it was the case with Lennon Lacy, is that the police, within - his body was found on August 29th, 20 days after the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, following the murder of Mike Brown - August 29, 2014, on a Friday. And the police station was closed over the weekend because there was a holiday, and so they didn't come to investigate anything until Tuesday, when they approached Claudia, Lennon's mother. And they didn't look through his phone, and they didn't look for evidence of anything beyond a suicide, but were really insistent that that was the case. And I found that this is happening again and again. And so, families are really calling for there to be a deeper investigation and for justice.\n\nAnd you had mentioned that the family members of Malcolm Harsch have conceded that he committed suicide. One of the interesting things, as I was reading - two points that they made, one of which is that the police didn't really investigate his case. Even though it was a suicide - it ended up being a suicide - it's important that they show up and that they investigate it thoroughly, and they didn't do that until there was press attention.\n\nThe other comment that was made around the case is that it's a relief that that wasn't a lynching. I think it's equally as important that in these cases of suicide, that we look closely at that.\n\nAnd so, in my research, as I was researching for Always in Season , I found that there were dozens of cases of Black people found hanging publicly since 2000 - since 1995, actually. I started looking at the case of Antwan Sedgwick, who was found hanging in Hampton, Virginia, hours after the O.J. Simpson verdict. And that case was ruled a suicide. And so, there have been dozens of deaths, and there, unfortunately, sadly, are not exact numbers. There's a CDC report that I've been looking at that says that there have been 79 unsolved hangings of Blacks and that they've all been males, in this report, 79 hangings that are unsolved between 2000 and 2016.\n\nAnd so, you have all of these cases in the midst of violence we know that's not being acknowledged. If it weren't for the outcry, the public outcry, around Ahmaud Arbery's murder, for example, then the McDaniels, Travis and Gregory McDaniel, and the accomplice would not have been held accountable.\n\nAnd so, there is a justified outcry. Even when the result is a suicide, there's a justified outcry that comes out of the Black community, but by anyone who's paying attention and concerned, that these might be lynchings.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about the case of \"Tete\" Gulley, a Black transgender woman experiencing homelessness who was found hanging in Portland, Oregon. It got a lot of attention recently, and, in fact, it got so much attention that a lot of people, including us, thought it had just happened in May of this year, but it was actually a year ago. The local medical examiner ruled her death to be a suicide, but her family believes she may have been killed. Now it's getting renewed attention as a result of the hangings in California, Texas and New York have gained national attention. So, as you point out, it is not only Black men in these cases. And talk about the significance of the renewed interest in finding out what happened, investigating \"Tete\" Gulley's death.\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : Yeah. I think it's important to look at. I also thought that the death happened on May 27th of this year, but, in fact, it was May 27, 2019. And part of that reason is because the case, the story, was dropped by the press in 2019 and then kicked up with these more recent hanging deaths. And so, this kind of invisibility that goes with these hanging cases, in general, is even greater with trans women, trans people, like \"Tete\" Gulley, for whom the family still believes that she didn't commit suicide. And the last news reports I saw on the case were from 2019, until very recently.\n\nAnd so, that's just an example of how, when we look - one is, when we look at these cases individually, we're not giving the issues the attention that's merited, the issue about collectively what's going on, beyond just dropping in on one case and then out when the police decide that they've figured out or that they've investigated enough, is that it's important for journalists, in particular, to look at all of it comprehensively and in the context of historic lynching terrorism. And so, just as with historic lynchings, certainly Black men were the primary victims of lynching, but women and children were also the victims of lynching.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about how these hangings are often after some kind of horrific event, like the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014? Lennon Lacy, the case you looked at, at Always in Season , that happened right after that. And then, of course, you have the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the police uprising, and then these subsequent hangings.\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : And they also come after touchstones that are racialized. And so, there was an upsurge in noose incidents, threats by noose, when President Obama campaigned for the very first time. Between 2005 and 2008, there was an upsurge that was reported by the Southern Poverty Law Center. And so, there are these points in which there is some momentum by the Black community, a bit of progress, that's met with backlash. And there's also these points in which there's this signaling from leadership that violence is OK.\n\nAnd so, you have, out of this, all of this violence that we see, and particularly Black people and Brown people are really tuned into, in ways that the mainstream doesn't necessarily acknowledge. We see it. We understand that there are connections between what happens when police shoot Oscar Brown in the back, when they murder George Floyd on video, and these hangings, and that there could possibly be a connection. And so, the outcry, even when there's a suicide, is out of this sense of urgency that all of these things, including the noose incidents and all of these ways that Black lives are threatened and minimized, they could very easily result in lynching.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You also have the case in 2018 of the son of a prominent Ferguson activist, Melissa McKinnies, her son found hanging behind the family home in Ferguson. He was 24 years old. She says he was lynched. So, in all of these cases, what are you demanding happens now, Jacqueline?\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : I think that they deserve a full investigation, and that they - and given the context of this history and given what people in communities understand about the racial divisions in these communities and the families' concern, that we look at them more than three days, that they are - and then that they are looked at as a whole, because whether or not these are lynchings or whether or not they're suicides, is there - the question's around: Is there this new trend for Black people to hang themselves publicly? There's been historically the stigma for Black people about hanging, and certainly hanging publicly and hanging from trees. But if these are suicides, then that's information that's really important to understand, in addition to understanding what are the issues around structural racism that can increase depression and increase anxiety and the suicide rate for Black people. Those are all really important to understand.\n\nSo, you have, for example, Malcolm Harsch, who was found hanging, and even though the investigation hasn't concluded yet because of toxicology reports, you have him found hanging at a homeless encampment. And so there are issues about housing instability and insecurity for Black people, in particular, that are important to look at.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jacqueline Olive, I want to thank you for being with us. And again, thank you for your remarkable film, Always in Season -\n\nJACQUELINE OLIVE : Thank you, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - a documentary about the history of lynchings in America. That does it for our show. I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us. Stay safe.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

We speak with Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker about how, on January 24, six deputies in Braxton, Mississippi, raided the home they were staying in and attacked them, and how they are speaking out to demand justice. Meanwhile, the deputies have been linked to at least four violent attacks on Black men since 2019, in which two of the men died. We also speak with civil rights attorney Malik Shabazz, who is representing Jenkins and Parker in a federal lawsuit against the Rankin County Sheriff's Department. Shabazz asserts that the majority-white Rankin County, which is 20 miles away from majority-Black Jackson, Mississippi, is \"infested with white supremacists\" who \"have decided 'Rankin County is for whites'\" and seek to enforce it through state-sanctioned violence and torture, overseen and covered up by Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey. \"We demand that Bryan Bailey step down,\" says Shabazz.

Some of the officers face life in prison.\n\nOn January 24th, court records show the deputies raided a home in Braxton, Mississippi, after a white neighbor of one of the officers called in to complain there were Black men staying there. The officer texted the others, quote, \"Are y'all available for a mission?\"\n\nThat night, without a warrant, the officers burst into the home, handcuffed, beat, tasered the two men, Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker, also sexually abused them with a sex toy while shouting racial slurs. One of the officers put a gun in Jenkins' mouth for a \"mock execution\" and pulled the trigger. The bullet lacerated Jenkins' tongue, broke his jaw, exited through his neck.\n\nThis is U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca last week announcing federal charges against the former officers for the attack.\n\nDARREN LAMARCA : But not only did they brazenly commit these acts, but after inflicting serious bodily injury by firing a shot through one of the victims' mouths, they left him lying in a pool of blood, gathered on the porch of the house to discuss how to cover it up. What indifference. What disregard for life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After the attack, Michael Corey Jenkins was actually charged with a felony, based on methamphetamine the officers said they found in the raid. But records show that was a lie, and the charge was dropped. In fact, the deputies planted drugs to devise an excuse for the raid and also stole surveillance video from the house. Their body cameras were off.\n\nCourt documents said the officers used the name Goon Squad, quote, \"because of their willingness to use excessive force and not to report it.\" The Associated Press found the deputies were linked to at least four violent attacks on Black men since 2019 - two of the men died.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker, as well as Malik Shabazz, a civil rights attorney with Black Lawyers for Justice, who's representing them.\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Malik, let's begin with you. Can you talk about how this case was exposed, how we saw these officers charged, and what you understand about their background, this not being the first vicious attack?\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ : OK. Thank you for having us on. I want to say, before we get started, that Michael and Eddie will only be speaking - that they cannot speak about the specific details of what happened in that house that night, but they can talk about their reactions to the guilty verdicts and to their pain and suffering. And Michael is suffering, because half of his face is numb. And we have sentencing coming up, so we're under certain sensitive legal guidelines. But we're happy to be on with such a progressive audience.\n\nThis case was brought to light through the determination of Black Lawyers for Justice, of myself as the attorney for Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, and Mississippi counsel Trent Walker. From early January, we have advocated strongly and vigorously in every way, and we have worked with community activists in Mississippi and throughout the country, in order to bring the truth that is coming to light today, that these defendants - Hunter Elward, Christian Dedmon, Brett McAlpin, Middleton, Opdyke and Joshua Hartfield - that they're called the Rankin County \"Goon Squad.\" They're known in the community as the Rankin County \"death squad.\" This has been occurring for a long time under the leadership of Sheriff Bryan Bailey, who is a - should be the subject of criminal investigation also. And they have been getting away with this so long that they felt emboldened to act in such a radical and callous way on that night of January 24th, 2023. But it's through persistence, it's through intense legal advocacy, with us advocating to the U.S. Justice Department, collecting evidence and applying legal pressure and all kinds of pressure, to bring about what is now historic.\n\nLast Thursday, these six defendants pled guilty to 14 federal criminal charges. They will plead guilty to more state charges Monday. This is the first time, Democracy Now! This is the first time that a white Mississippi police officer has ever been held criminally responsible for harming a Black person. And we know that plenty of police brutality has occurred, not only in Rankin County under Bryan Bailey, but throughout the state of Mississippi. This is a history-making moment. I'm just so sorry it had to come on the backs of the pain and the suffering, the torture and the shooting and the abuse and waterboarding of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, our clients.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I can't bear to go to Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, meeting you in this way, for what you went through that horrific January night. But I'm wondering if each of you could respond to the guilty plea of these officers and what it means to you that some of them may be facing life in prison. Michael Jenkins, let's begin with you.\n\nMICHAEL JENKINS : I feel - I feel great that we're finally getting justice, after months. You know, at first, they didn't even believe us. For a while, l didn't think they was going to even get a slap on the wrist or anything. But I feel great about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I know it's difficult for you to talk, with the gun in your mouth - the police shot you through your mouth, lacerating your tongue. It went through to your neck, shredding that area of your neck. I am only glad that you can be with us today. Did you think you were going to survive that night, Michael?\n\nMICHAEL JENKINS : No, ma'am. No, ma'am. I'm still going through pain right now, my whole face numb, my mouth hurting right now, as we speak.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Eddie, Eddie Parker, if you can talk about your response to this plea deal?\n\nEDDIE PARKER : It's a long time coming. It's some - I say this is also history, too, you know, coming from a long way of going through this situation with the same police officers. And pretty much, you steer clear, you know, stay out the way, so you wouldn't end up in this situation, but ended up in this situation with a part of me, you know, staying clear. So, I'm astounded. I'm real happy that it's finally come to a point where they're getting a feeling of what they dish out to people, you know, day in, day out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I really misspoke, because it's not a deal. They have pled guilty. The idea that they call themselves, Eddie Parker, that they call themselves the \"Goon Squad,\" your thoughts?\n\nEDDIE PARKER : That's the Goon Squad. That seems to be a crime organization, as well. They were - I guess they were paid to go out and, you know, to stop, but they became that theirself. I believe police and the public, you know, go hand in hand. I mean, they're people, just like us. You know, they want to be held accountable for everything they do. They want to get, you know, this certain, I guess you say, the end-of-the-stick treatment as being the golden ones. But they're not. They're people, just like us. I mean, they go out, and they do, you know, the opposite of what they're getting paid to do. I think it's very horrendous how they can call theirself, you know, Goon Squad and still put on a badge and say they're protecting people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Malik Shabazz, your lawsuit also mentions other times Rankin County sheriff deputies used excessive force. I want to ask you about Damien Cameron, who died in 2021 after being taken into custody by the same Rankin County sheriff's deputies who later attacked Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker. This is a clip from a WAPT news report featuring [Cameron's] mother, Monica Lee.\n\nERIN PICKENS : A news release from the Rankin County Sheriff's Office says deputies got a call about a burglary and vandalism. When they arrived, Damien was identified as the suspect. The release says as a deputy approached him, he began to fight and resist arrest. They were able to eventually get him into custody and into a patrol car.\n\nMONICA LEE : And I'm thinking they're taking my son to jail, so I go outside to tell my son goodbye and I love him, and I'll be up there tomorrow. At that point, when I got to the side of the truck, my son was laying on the ground, unresponsive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Monica Lee has said she believes if the sheriff had taken action against the deputies involved in her son's death, maybe they would not have gone on to attack Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker. The lawsuit also holds Sheriff Bailey responsible for failing to properly train the deputies involved in these incidents. This is Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey speaking last week about the charges his former deputies pled guilty to.\n\nSHERIFF BRYAN BAILEY : Based on the facts and the guilty pleas, all of the former deputies lied to me that night of this incident in January. We have cooperated fully with all outside investigating agencies to uncover the truth and bring justice to the victims. We've also sought assistance from outside agencies and consultants to help us in repairing our trust with the community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that was Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey speaking last week. Malik Shabazz, the civil rights attorney who has brought the lawsuit on behalf of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, if you can respond to the sheriff and to this previous case?\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ : Yes. First of all, I want to give honors to Ms. Monica Lee, who is the mother of Damien Cameron. Attorney Trent Walker and myself, we represent Ms. Monica Lee for the death of Damien Cameron, which occurred at the hands of the Rankin County Sheriff's Department and its officers, including Hunter Elward, the shooter, who didn't just shoot Michael Jenkins in his mouth. He placed the gun inside Michael Jenkins' mouth and held it for an extended period of time, almost up to a minute, before he intentionally shot Michael Jenkins in his mouth, attempting to kill him.\n\nYes, Ms. Lee is correct: If they would not have participated in a cover-up around Damien Cameron's death - Damien Cameron's death is analogous and very similar to George Floyd's death. It was Hunter Elward and Luke Stickman who put the knees on Damien Cameron's back and on his neck, causing trauma to his neck and causing hemorrhages in both Damien Cameron's eyes, meaning that the compression on his neck is what led to asphyxiation and his actual cause of death. But the autopsy, mysteriously, was ruled undetermined. With all of the evidence that I'm saying and all of the gruesome photos of the neck injuries and the hemorrhages of the eyes bulging out of his head, the autopsy finding was mysteriously undetermined. The autopsy itself is missing certain information, and therefore, myself and Black Lawyers for Justice, we have our own forensic pathologists who are coming forth shortly to show you that this was homicide, and that Rankin County and Bryan Bailey refused to provide the state medical examiner with information to reach a proper conclusion, because they were all protecting the officers from criminal prosecution. Therefore, the autopsy is suspicious. The autopsy and the efforts to have a genuine autopsy, it was covered up by Rankin County. And Bryan Bailey has been a part of this. Ms. Lee is correct: If they hadn't been trying to cover up, if Bailey hadn't been trying to justify his officers - no, he didn't just not train them. He has participated in acts of excessive force with his department, according to the courts. When Hunter Elward shot Pierre Woods in Rankin County on the ground, and he gunned him - and he shot him nine times with his rifle, and the man was no threat to him, Sheriff Bailey was on the scene, and a federal judge ruled that Bailey could not have qualified immunity, because he ratified and watched it all go on in person.\n\nAnd so, the truth is coming out about the death of Damien Cameron and how they had the knees on his neck, like his mother has testified by affidavit to, and they had the knees on his neck that crushed the life out of Damien Cameron, and they did nothing about it. They've lied to us, but we're going to bring that case. That case is coming back to life.\n\nRankin County is infested with white supremacists, Ku Klux Klan. They infiltrated the sheriff's department. Bryan Bailey has known about this. Many of these criminals were on duty up until June 1st. Only through the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Department of Justice leader Kristen Clarke and her Southern District in Mississippi, who have done a great job - only through their efforts has Bryan Bailey, sheriff, trying to come to some remorse. He has not even apologized to the victims. We demand that Bryan Bailey step down now. He's a part of a pattern, a practice and a culture and a custom of terrorism by his department. We have Blacks, whites, rich, poor. They have been beaten by his officers. He has known this all along.\n\nAnd the struggle continues in this case for compensation for these two suffering victims, Jenkins and Parker, but for all of the victims of Rankin County terrorism. It's the number one county for terrorism and white supremacist infiltration. Case in point before I close, Christian Dedmon, he has - it's coming out he has family members that have pled guilty in Mississippi to hate crimes. I mean, a lot more is going to come out about this. Rankin County is infested with white supremacists, Ku Klux Klan, and it's in the police department.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Malik Shabazz, can you place Rankin County for us in two ways, in history and also just geographically? It's right near Jackson, the capital?\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ : Yes. Attorney Trent Walker says - who grew up in Rankin County, my partner, attorney Trent Walker, states that this was customary in Rankin County. They beat first, and they don't ask questions later. They beat you, they kill you, and you are ordered not to say anything about it.\n\nHunter Elward, the shooter, actually pled guilty in federal court to another crime he had committed, which contained a similar fact to what he did in the home of Jenkins and Parker. When these deputies busted in to begin this torture session, Hunter Elward shot his gun off as an intimidation against Jenkins and Parker. Before he shot Michael later, he shot his gun off. Well, he pled guilty in federal court to doing the same thing to another person in Rankin County, just shooting his gun off like that.\n\nSo, what we're saying, ma'am, is that all of these truths are going to come to light. Rankin County has done this for a long time. It's near Jackson, Mississippi. Jackson, Mississippi - and I believe the county is sort of a reaction to Jackson. Jackson is in Hinds County. It's majority Black, and there's hostility towards Jackson. And Rankin is like a white enclave that is next to Jackson, and it's set up almost like a political, social antithesis against Jackson. And so, they're clearing Rankin, just 20 minutes away from Jackson, Mississippi, just like these deputies said. They didn't want any Black men living in the area. The mere fact that there were Black men in this area, that they were going to carry out this mission and let them know that they were not welcome, and they were going to violate all laws and break in. It's because they have determined - I believe these deputies and others in that county have determined that Rankin County is for whites, and Hinds County is for Blacks. And they're going to enforce it, under the color of law, through violence and torture.\n\nNot to mention, especially on this program, we cannot forget waterboarding. Waterboarding was where the United States military was condemned for using these techniques at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in the Iraq War. The military denounced this. But in 2023, incredibly, in Rankin County, these deputies - Elward, McAlpin, Dedmon, Opdyke, Middleton, Hartsfield - they actually waterboarded the two men you see now. They had them on their backs. They had them in handcuffs. They had them intimidated. And they were pouring milk, liquids and grease all over their faces in this insane interrogation and intimidation act.\n\nThen, after they did all this - can you imagine law enforcement with dildos and sexual devices in their possession, attempting and putting it in the mouths - I hate to say this, that happened to the brothers, but we've got to know their pain and suffering - to take a dildo and to shove it in the mouths of handcuffed and bound men, and then - and waterboard them like that on the ground, and then hurl eggs at them, and then make them strip naked in the shower to try to clean this mess up, strip these men naked in front of these criminals? You know, it just never fails to ignite my passion, and therefore, tactically and strategically, we are after Rankin County, and we won't let up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to end with the voices of Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker. How you have lived through the aftermath of this, the trauma that you have experienced, and what you want to come out of this? I mean, it looks like you are exposing an entire sheriff's department in Mississippi. Let's begin with Eddie Parker.\n\nEDDIE PARKER : Well, we want justice. We want justice for everyone that has gone through this with Rankin County or gone through this because of Rankin County. We want justice for the ones that were afraid to speak up, you know, justice for the ones that can't speak up. We want, you know, something new and better, you know, in the claim to come out of this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Michael Jenkins?\n\nMICHAEL JENKINS : Basically the same thing, to make sure that nobody never goes through what we went through again. You know, animals don't get treated like this. You know, I ain't never seen no animal get treated like this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well -\n\nMICHAEL JENKINS : Just to make sure -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I just want to thank you, Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker, for your bravery in coming forward and telling your stories, and also I want to thank Malik Shabazz, the civil rights attorney with Black Lawyers for Justice.\n\nComing up, we're going to Detroit to talk to a woman who was falsely arrested and jailed while eight months pregnant, due to faulty AI facial recognition technology. She's the first woman to be arrested for this. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Hunter Elward received a 20-year prison sentence; Jeffrey Middleton was sentenced to 17-and-a-half years. Both pleaded guilty to multiple felony federal and state charges last August, along with four other former law enforcement officers. The six men burst into a home and then beat, handcuffed, waterboarded and tasered Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker. The officers also sexually abused them with a sex toy while shouting racial slurs. One of the officers put a gun in Jenkins's mouth for a \"mock execution\" and pulled the trigger. The bullet lacerated Jenkins's tongue, broke his jaw and exited through his neck. The officers then planted drugs at the scene in an attempt to cover up their act. One of the officers, Hunter Elward, was also sentenced for his role in a separate assault, just two weeks earlier, when another member of the \"Goon Squad\" repeatedly tased a man and pressed his genitals against him."

      "text": "'It's like we're seen as animals': black men on their vulnerability and resilience\n\nAmerican black men have historically been depicted as violent, and the racist fear that has resulted means they're actually constantly at risk and deeply fragile\n\nI n the fall of 2013, very shortly after moving to Detroit, I covered the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Renisha McBride. It was a disturbingly grim story. McBride, a 19-year-old black woman from Detroit, had crashed her car in the middle of the night in the white suburb of Dearborn Heights. Seeking help, she ventured to nearby homes and banged on the door of a white middle-aged man, Theodore Wafer. He responded by shooting her dead through his unopened screen door.\n\nThe day I got my brief from editors in New York, I was due to meet with my family friend Justin, a Detroit native who, at the time, was working in the lines at Ford. Feeling a responsibility for me, and knowing me to be so far from home, Justin had quickly taken on a brotherly role with me. I liked to refer to him as my fairy godmother.\n\nWe made for an eclectic pair. Justin is 6ft 5in, weighs 300lb and looks like he could be a former American football player. He is black. I am a medium-sized white woman, with peroxide hair and a very British accent. He offered to drive me around as I spoke to neighbors of the shooter, community members, the police and activists.\n\nBut as we entered Dearborn Heights, a white suburb, I noticed Justin would let me out of the car but never come with me. When we got to the police station, he shrunk in his car. We had lunch together, and the white waitress scowled when we declared we would share the soup.\n\n\"What you don't see, Rose,\" he said to me, \"is that I am in danger here.\"\n\nIt turns out, despite working down the road, Dearborn Heights was a place Justin made sure to never come through. Driving through carried the threat of being pulled over, at the very least. Citing a history of housing discrimination, Justin said he knew he wasn't welcome there. Detroit activists later referred to Dearborn Heights as a \" sundown town \" - a place black people would historically know they shouldn't get caught after dark. Little had changed, they said.\n\nAt the police station, white officers welcomed me with open arms. They laughed and made jokes when I told then I lived in the heart of Detroit, a city as overwhelmingly black as their suburb was overwhelmingly white. Was I safe there? they asked me.\n\nThere I was, a single young white woman, and everyone near and far was concerned for my safety. But it was the 300lb man next to me, Justin, who was constantly shrinking, silently modifying his behavior to remain safe. To protect his life. He was the body that was unsafe. Constructs and prejudice meant that black and male was a dangerous combination for him.\n\nThe killings last week of two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, at the hands of police, reminded me of the lessons from that day.\n\nIn America, black men have historically been depicted as aggressive, hypersexual and violent - to be controlled, to be exploited, to be tamed. The result of that construct and the accompanying racist fear and forced subjugation it justifies has been counterintuitive: black men in America are in fact deeply fragile and constantly at risk.\n\n\"The emotional connection I have [to the news] is that it could be me at any time, any day it could be me,\" says William Jones, a 22-year-old New Yorker who works in high-end retail.\n\nEvery single black man I spoke to for the purpose of this article echoed Jones's feelings.\n\n\"Every day, I live and operate with that feeling of fragility, that feeling that I could be taken out at any time. I am a chokehold away from being Eric Garner,\" says Ben Saunders, a 37-year-old professor of psychology at Long Island University.\n\nUp until now, Saunders says that he has been vigilant with himself in public. He makes sure to avoid causing a fuss, even if a fuss is warranted. He suppresses any strong feelings of anger. He doesn't speak up. His white wife sometimes wonders why not. \"Black people have been killed for saying less than that,\" he says he responds to her.\n\nThe consequence of having to modify his behavior in such a way? \"A loss of dignity,\" he says.\n\nJoshua Lott, a 37-year-old industry-renowned photojournalist who has traveled across the United States on assignment for the world's biggest news organizations, says that experience has taught him to always be on edge when he arrives in a new place to work.\n\n\"I am extremely cautious, especially when I go into a place where there aren't many minorities. I know I am a potential target. I am a target because I am a journalist, because I am a black man, I am tall and I wear colors.\"\n\nPeople have called the police on him while he has been on assignment, he says. He recalls sirens and police cars racing towards him in a quiet neighborhood in Arizona where he was covering the housing crisis. A woman had told him he didn't belong there and called 911.\n\nOn top of his usual press credentials, Lott always carries a copy of the New York Times with him, featuring one of his credited photos on the front page. It is a frustrating reality that he knows is a necessary one to keep him safe.\n\n\"I shouldn't have to keep newspapers to tell people what I am doing and what I am about.\"\n\nLott says he has had his fair share of unprovoked \"police encounters\", including one very bad case of police brutality that occurred while he was covering a demonstration in Chicago and that was settled out of court, but he considers himself lucky.\n\n\"I am extremely fortunate, the cops could have pulled a gun on me and killed me. They could have made up any old thing.\"\n\nMichael Oppenheimer, a 39-year-old public defender who has practiced in New York City, Washington DC and Baltimore, says that it is the norm in his job to meet a black or brown man who has just been arrested on a misdemeanor and has suffered a broken nose, stitches or a black eye at the hands of police.\n\nThere is little that can be done to seek justice for these men, he says. \"The three charges, especially in New York, that ring a bell are disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and assaulting of a police officer - that's code for the cops beat you up and now they have to figure out a way to justify it.\"\n\nOppenheimer says that part of what drew him to a career as a public defender is the knowledge that as a black man, however well educated or well dressed you can be, however well you behave, you can be mistreated. There is no escaping it.\n\n\"This is not black people saying we feel we are being discriminated against. It is statistical,\" he says, referring to data showing a disproportionate number of people killed or subjected to force by police are black.\n\nOppenheimer has had a policeman draw a gun on him while he was paying for a yellow cab in New York with his credit card after a night out at a restaurant. The policeman, after talking with the cab driver and realizing his mistake - that the lawyer was not in fact robbing the cabbie - told him \"you know how it is around here\" by way of explanation.\n\n\"His response was basically, you know what, black man, you should be used to this. My role in that instance is to shut up and take it. But I was freaked out. You don't know what's in other people's hearts. He could have fired a shot.\"\n\nEveryone has a story. It becomes almost like this perverse rite of passage for black men in America.\"\n\nSaunders, the psychology professor, says that in any given situation, he makes sure to always be aware of whether there is a police officer around. If one is around, he makes sure to modify his own behavior and be in tune with how he might be perceived at any given moment.\n\nWilliam Jones, the 22-year-old, is 6ft 6in. He says he knows he can be perceived as threatening. He says that is simply not fair. No one is born racist, he points out: racism is taught, and it should be untaught.\n\nJones knows his historical facts and informs me, sitting on a sidewalk in south Harlem, that not that many years ago I would not have been allowed to interview him. \"It's not just that we wouldn't have been able to talk, it's that I could be killed for you talking to me,\" Jones says, explaining that history is not that far away. In 1955, 14-year-old African American Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi after he interacted with a white woman in a grocery store.\n\n\"It's like we are seen as animals. Treated like animals. It's not easy.\"\n\nJones's words recall the way in which the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson who shot black teenager Michael Brown to death, described perceiving Brown as \"aggressive\", \"angry\" and like a \" demon \" just moments before he ended the 18-year-old's life.\n\nA psychology study from 2014 authored by Phillip Goff at the University of California found that black children were consistently perceived by police officers as older and less innocent than their white peers.\n\n\"We found evidence that overestimating age and culpability based on racial differences was linked to dehumanizing stereotypes,\" Goff said of the study.\n\n\"Stereotypes always undermine the experience of an individual, or of being in a group,\" Saunders, the psychology professor, says. This past week, as he has sought community and to make sense of the events in the news, he says he has witnessed many of his black male friends break down in tears.\n\n\"The reluctance to view black men as being fragile is something that has been projected on African American men through stereotyping and prejudice.\"\n\n\"People think about black men, they do not think of vulnerability. There is not even an opportunity for black men to show vulnerability,\" he continues.\n\nBut for Saunders, this moment marks a turning point.\n\nThe outrage and despair he feels have made him rethink his way of interacting with the world.\n\n\"Philando Castile was killed for cooperating. I realized you can be killed for cooperating. That was liberating because I don't need to focus on cooperating as much,\" he says, referring to the fact that Castile was shot by a police officer as he reached for his identification.\n\nReferring to a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar, Wearing The Mask, he says he is done with the wearing of a mask.\n\n\"Through having this unconscious cooperative mindset, I have built good credit with all these people, white people. They have thought of me as the good negro. I am ready to cash every chip that I have in this fight for social justice. Whether or not it means pushing people away. I am willing to cash it all in for this,\" he says.\n\n\"I always try and approach social justice issues from a place of cooperation, now I am approaching social justice issues from a place of demands.\""

      "text": "On mourning and manhood: the burdens we Black men must carry\n\nWe are taught to believe that breaking ourselves open reveals our weaknesses. But what about hope?\n\nA few hours ago, I turned off the camera on an early-morning work video chat during which we were asked to share what was in our hearts. I told my colleagues the truth. I'm broken by death. My insides are shaken by an overwhelming sense of dread magnified by the reality of being a Black man living in a country where Black people are exposed to old and new violences daily. The rise of fascism, should we be courageous enough to name it, is but one.\n\nI cancelled the rest of my meetings after that, and made myself a cocktail. I needed to disconnect from work and remain present with the other parts of my self that I wasn't attending to. Maybe what it means to be human is to accept that we might touch something akin to healing only after we accept that brokenness is the entry point into transformation. Black people know that we are not the problem in need of fixing. America is.\n\nIt feels irresponsible, though, to write about self-creation in a country that clings to lies - a country where the most vulnerable struggle to stay alive amid fears of Covid-19, of a police officer's gun or a racist militiaman's pickup truck.\n\nA friend wandered about the house while I reflected. He wanted to know why I returned to my bed after my call and remained there most of the day. The weight of denial made my tongue heavy. I refused to let him know that I felt trapped, and in a haze, and not because of the fiery smoke from historic wildfires choking the sky that have been politicized as an event of historic proportions, but sadness.\n\nI can't free myself from the sadness that results from systemic inequity or, rather, the systemic callousness that we cause. But because I am supposed to be productive even when I cannot, and because I am supposed to pretend I am well even when I am not, I end up saying nothing. I pulled myself out of the bed and walked downstairs where he was lounging and faked a smile, like real men do.\n\nT oday is my stepfather's birthday. He lived long after my biological father died. Two Black men - one of whom was taken too early by heart disease and another who is still alive, after having beaten prostate cancer. And now I write these words at the age of 44 - contemplative, sometimes worried about the length of my own life, heartened by my stepfather's resolve to keep living, but aware that Black men's fights to survive may not be enough to stave off the death-dealing grips of heritable diseases or police officers' hands. How quickly will some of us Black men succumb? And how determined are some of us to survive?\n\nI am no less aware of the many ways that Black men are prone to survive even as pathogens attempt to eat away at our hearts. And we sometimes eat away at our own hearts and the hearts of those we love. And we sometimes remember that we deserve to live a life with hearts wide open ready to give and receive love. Like most truths, that one is hard to sit with. As I write these words under the cover of a fire, as my neighbors and I breathe small amounts of smoke and ash, I am thinking about vulnerability and fear and longing and isolation and pain and life and death and joy and peace and fragility and masks and manhood and my pops. My heart is burning, too. Because I can't unsee white police officer Derek Chauvin's knee pinned to George Floyd's neck as he panted, \"I can't breathe.\" Because, closer to home, Dijon Kizzee was killed by the police. Because Breonna Taylor's face is stuck in my mind and the reality that the police officers who killed her walked free. Because white racists deputized themselves before they killed Ahmaud Arbery while he jogged. The sky is dreary and so is my mind. More than a few of the elders who have nurtured me have passed on. I am hurting because these times won't allow for the offering of a proper goodbye despite the fact that goodbyes are never easy to give or receive. It is especially hard to mourn as men. We are taught to believe that breaking ourselves open reveals our weaknesses. Goodbyes, like mourning, require us to sit in the break, in the liminal spaces that exist between our frail and shattered parts, such that we might piece back together a different self crafted out of ruins. It's personal. At this very moment, I am suffering the loss of a dear friend, a comrade, a Black woman who had fought cancer. She died at the age of 39 in the midst of the pandemic. We are living in a time when Black people are being snatched during a pandemic that has revealed the ways that nature and nurture conspire. A pandemic, for example, has been made worse because of the current US administration's woeful and willful incompetence; global climate change that has been quickened by the actions of humans has given way to exaggerated results like ceaseless wildfires; and here I am writing about a type of grief that men find ourselves grappling with from inside the bowels of isolation, whether that isolation surfaces as a result of a pandemic or a set of ideas shaped by our faith in male dominance. Men - like the United States - are thought to be exceptional. We tend to lie because we've been taught not to be honest about our vulnerabilities and failures. Men, like this country, often assert sole control in crises and everyday life even if the circumstances that we face require our reliance on others beside ourselves. In the US, that might look like a white-male-dominated presidential administration puffing out their chests on national television, without masks, while downplaying the severity of a pandemic during its height. It might also look like my refusal to feel.\n\nKnowing that, I try to force my way into feeling and out of hiding. So I turn on music. In the background I can hear Gregory Porter's voice riffing on a track titled Revival Song, and I think that it's fitting. From what state do we need to be rescued and revived? In the foreground, I struggle to tell my partner that I am gutted and to articulate the depths of the volcanic hurt bubbling inside.\n\nI grieve without tears. No desperate cries for release. Like most, I've gotten used to surviving a catastrophe. But when I leave the house I realize that throughout my life I've chosen to wear masks because it was easier than showing my frown, my grin, my truest self. It was easier than addressing what I had ignored or denied, what this country has ignored or denied.\n\nBut what about hope? Hope is a luxury afforded to those who are given the space to dream far beyond the limitations of their conditions. And yet, Black people hold on to hope despite the absence of hope's fulfillment.\n\nHope allows us to look forward. It allows us to vision ourselves on the other side of a pandemic. Hope allows us to break free from the cage that is patriarchy, but for many of us it is a cage that we experience as home. And if it is home, then we may choose the comfort of familiarity over the fear that surfaces because we don't yet know what may await us on the other side of freedom.\n\nThe beginning of freedom, however, is the ending of our denial. So I want to accept that I am not strong enough to lie about the grief that I feel. I am heavy because the world is - because inequity and white supremacy and the pandemic make it so. Yes, I believe that I will live through this pandemic. There is no hope to be found, though, in fires of our design, like the conceptions of manhood that have us believing that vulnerability and honesty are wrong. We find there only mourning, only senses of captivity and isolation that too many men feel but are afraid to admit.

      "text": "Harris reveals 'opportunity agenda for Black men' in efforts to shore up support\n\nPlan includes loan program and apprenticeships as worries grow that some Black voters aren't excited for Harris-Walz\n\nKamala Harris has revealed a plan to give Black men more economic opportunities, as anxiety mounts among her supporters that some in the Black community are less enthused by the Democratic presidential ticket than in recent elections, and may sit this one out - or support Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice-president's plan includes forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships, and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men. It also includes ensuring that Black men have more access to shaping a national cannabis industry and to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nHarris presented the so-called \"opportunity agenda for Black men\" on Monday, before speaking in the north-west corner of Erie, Pennsylvania , the country's largest battleground state. It will be Harris's 10th visit to Pennsylvania this election season.\n\nPolitical support among Black men for the Harris-Walz campaign has been wavering somewhat. Last week, Barack Obama suggested that some Black men \"aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president\".\n\nThe former president's comments were later condemned by the Florida Republican representative Byron Donalds and Texas's Wesley Hunt, members of Black Men for Trump, which posted a letter accusing Obama of being \"insulting\" and \"demeaning\".\n\n\"President Obama's recent call for Black men to support Kamala Harris based solely on her skin color, rather than her policies, is deeply insulting,\" the letter states. \"Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don't owe our votes to any candidate just because they 'look like us'.\"\n\nOver the weekend, the former president Bill Clinton was drafted in to speak to worshippers at a Zion Baptist church in Albany, Georgia, in support of Harris.\n\n\"Uniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,\" Clinton said. \"Blaming, dividing, demeaning - they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don't work.\"\n\nA poll in the New York Times placed Harris slightly behind Joe Biden among Black likely voters and showed one in five Black men support Trump. Despite alarm at the poll, the figures still show strong Black support for Democrats - but while the president won 87% of the Black vote in 2020, Harris's numbers are lower. Seventy-eight per cent of Black voters in key battleground states polled in September said they would support the Democrat.\n\nRaphael Warnock, a Democratic senator from Georgia, warned against overestimating the shift. \"Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers,\" he told CNN on Sunday. \"There will be some. We're not a monolith.\"\n\nWarnock predicted Black voters would remember that Trump had personally taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times in 1989 calling for the state to bring back the death penalty and to strengthen policing after the brutal beating and rape of a female jogger in Central Park.\n\nThe so-called \"Central Park Five\" - five Black teenagers - were falsely accused of the crime and imprisoned for several years, before finally being exonerated in 2002. \"Donald Trump has shown no deal of concern about what they went through, no deal, no bit of contrition about it,\" Warnock added.\n\nBut the South Carolina representative Jim Clyburn, who helped secure Biden's Democratic nomination in 2020, told the network he is \"concerned about the Black men staying home or voting for Trump\".\n\n\"Black men, like everybody else, want to know exactly what I can expect from a Harris administration. And I have been very direct with them. And I have also contrasted that with what they can expect from a Trump administration,\" Clyburn said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nDemocrats have previously been accused of taking the Black vote for granted. In 2020, Biden was forced to apologize for telling the popular radio host Charlamagne Tha God that if African Americans \"have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black\".\n\nTrump has sought to capitalize on wavering Black male support for Democrats who may sympathize with his \"America First\" policies around employment and immigration.\n\nAs well as Harris's new policy outreach to Black men, she is also reaching out to Hispanic men who might also be cool to her candidacy, via an \"Hombres con Harris\" outreach featuring ad buys and Hispanic celebrity events in battleground states.\n\nThree weeks out from polling day, there is some Democratic concern that Harris's support among men broadly needs attention. Polls have found that there is roughly a 60-40 split between men and women, with men favoring Republicans and women Democrats.\n\nA Pew Research Center study released last year asked Americans how important it is to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. It found that only 18% of US adults said this is extremely or very important to them, with some 64% saying it was not too important or not at all, or that the president's gender did not matter."

      "text": "'I'm rocking with Kamala': Black men defy faulty polling by showing up for Harris campaign\n\nSpecific results on her performance with Black voters aren't in yet, but recent calls suggest a Trump exodus is not true\n\nO n Monday night, more than 53,000 Black men joined a virtual conference, Win With Black Men, to rally behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. During the four-hour call, organizers said the group raised more than $1.3m for the Harris campaign and grassroots voter organizations focused on Black men.\n\nThe success of the call, which was inspired by the Win With Black Women call the night before , runs counter to the narrative shaped by recent election polling indicating that 30% of Black men are planning on voting for Donald Trump. \"Don't let anybody slow us down asking the question: 'Can a Black woman be elected president of the United States?'\" Raphael Warnock, who represents Georgia in the US Senate, said on the call. \"Kamala Harris can win. We just have to show up. History is watching us, and the future is waiting on us.\"\n\nBlack voters have consistently been a key voting bloc for Democrats , but experts say inaccurate polling about Black men in particular could be creating false narratives about their leanings this election cycle, mainly the idea that there is a mass shift of Black voters to the Republican party. Win With Black Men, which was hosted by the journalist Roland Martin, said it's working to dispel stereotypical notions about changes in Black male voting habits, their refusal to support a woman candidate and their unwillingness to mobilize politically.\n\n\"People are making a lot of conjectures without actually talking to a large enough sample of Black people to be able to say things with the precision that they're making it,\" Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said. \"You're not going to be able to detect what is likely to be no more [than] a one- to three-point swing in favor of Donald Trump based on changes in surveys where you're talking to 200 Black people at a time. I can't say with any statistical certainty that that three-point shift is real or not.\"\n\nUnrepresentative polls can also have an adverse effect on voter habits. People tend to vote if they perceive that an election is close, Gillespie said. So polls that suggest that Trump is going to win easily and that even Black people will vote in droves for him may distort people's understanding of reality. Ensuring that the public is aware of potential polling inaccuracies is key.\n\n\"These narratives are also used to kind of confuse Black voters themselves, which can in turn depress Black vote and drive down turnout,\" said Christopher Towler, founder of the Black Voter Project (BVP), a national polling initiative. \"It can be used as a mechanism of voter deterrence, knowing that Black voters will play a key role in this election.\"\n\nThough Gillespie said it will take a few days for new polling that specifically examines how Harris is performing with Black voters, recent mobilization around Harris suggests that narratives about a would-be exodus of this bloc from the Democratic party might have been premature.\n\nThe problem comes down to sample size. In surveys of 1,000 to 1,500 voters , sub-sample sizes of Black voters may be anywhere from 150 to 300. In some cases, all people of color are amalgamated into one demographic group. Surveys with such a small sample size create large margins of error.\n\n\"The issue is the level of precision with which we can make certain types of pronouncements when you're talking to that few people,\" Gillespie said. \"The number that comes out in the survey is the midpoint of a range of possible numbers that we think is in the real population because of statistical analysis.\"\n\nIf the sub-sample size is less than 100, she said, the margin of error is plus or minus 10. So if a survey says that 20% of Black voters are going for Trump, the real number based on the sub-sample is between 10% and 30%.\n\nTowler, of the Black Voter Project, said that he began noticing the issue of unrepresentative polling years ago. He started BVP to \"counteract the industry standard of taping on a couple hundred Black responses to a general survey\" and using that small sample size as a full picture.\n\n\"It's really unscientific,\" Towler said. \"So I've worked for years now to try and create data that is reliable, accurate and actually representative of the Black community.\"\n\nThis year, BVP released a large, multiwave, national public opinion survey focused on collecting representative data of Black Americans . Fielded from 29 March to 18 April, with 2,004 Black Americans interviewed, the survey collected a nationally representative sample of respondents from all 50 states. The BVP study found that 15% of respondents would vote for Trump if the election had been held at the time of the survey, a figure much lower than reported by other polls with smaller sample sizes. A survey on the BVP scale is important to garner an idea of what the Black population and Black voting population of the US actually looks like, Gillespie said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nBut mainstream beltway polling companies typically lack Black leadership, so accurate polling of Black communities is not a priority, said Towler. What's more, some pollsters do not see the value in spending more money to survey a population that they estimate will already vote staunchly Democratic.\n\nBlack and brown communities exist on the margins in American politics, said Emmitt Riley, president of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists. Mainstream political scientists' biases result in pollsters who are not adequately capturing the political behaviors and views of excluded groups.\n\n\"Many people who study race aren't considered to be mainstream political scholars,\" he said. \"This has profound consequences for the kind of reporting that's happening, the kind of news stories that are coming out, how you describe what's happening in these communities.\"\n\nTowler said that pollsters should create surveys that are culturally competent and that ask questions in ways that don't manufacture misleading opinions. \"It's important when looking at polling of Black people to, one, not only make sure you have polls designed to accurately measure Black opinion, but to also have pollsters who study and understand the Black community,\" he said.\n\nWhile polls continue to try to parse out where Black men will place their political support, groups like Win With Black Men and Black Men for Harris are making their loyalties clear.\n\n\"Let's protect Kamala. Let's be with her like she was there for us,\" Bakari Sellers, the former South Carolina representative, said on the call. \"We are going to disagree a lot. But let's put the petty bickering aside. Let's stand up and be the Black men who change this country. We built this country. I'm rocking with Kamala.\""

      "text": "US justice is built to humiliate and oppress black men. And it starts with the chokehold\n\nThe author of the acclaimed Chokehold: Policing Black Men writes on how the system treats African Americans with contempt: 'If police patrolled white areas as they do poor black neighborhoods, there would be a revolution'\n\nChokehold: a maneuver in which a person's neck is tightly gripped in a way that restrains breathing. A person left in a chokehold for more than a few seconds can die.\n\nThe former police chief of Los Angeles Daryl Gates once suggested that there is something about the anatomy of African Americans that makes them especially susceptible to serious injury from chokeholds, because their arteries do not open as fast as arteries do on \"normal people.\"\n\nThe truth is any human being will suffer distress when pressure on the carotid arteries interrupts the supply of blood from the heart to the brain. Many police departments in the United States have banned chokeholds, but this does not stop some officers from using them when they perceive a threat.\n\nThe United States supreme court decided a case about chokeholds that tells you everything you need to know about how criminal \"justice\" works for African American men.\n\nIn 1976, Adolph Lyons, a 24-year-old black man, was pulled over by four Los Angeles police officers for driving with a broken taillight. The cops exited their squad cars with their guns drawn, ordering Lyons to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head.\n\nAfter Lyons was frisked, he put his hands down, causing one cop to grab Lyons's hands and slam them against his head. Lyons had been holding his keys and he complained that he was in pain. The police officer tackled Lyons and placed him in a chokehold until he blacked out. When Lyons regained consciousness, he was lying facedown on the ground, had soiled his pants, and was spitting up blood and dirt. The cops gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way.\n\nLyons sued to make the LAPD stop putting people in chokeholds. He presented evidence that in recent years 16 people - including 12 black men - had died in LAPD custody after being placed in chokeholds. In City of Los Angeles v Lyons , the US supreme court denied his claim, holding that because Lyons could not prove that he would be subject to a chokehold in the future, he had no \"personal stake in the outcome\". Dissenting from the court's opinion, Thurgood Marshall, the first African American on the supreme court, wrote:\n\n\"It is undisputed that chokeholds pose a high and unpredictable risk of serious injury or death. Chokeholds are intended to bring a subject under control by causing pain and rendering him unconscious. Depending on the position of the officer's arm and the force applied, the victim's voluntary or involuntary reaction, and his state of health, an officer may inadvertently crush the victim's larynx, trachea, or hyoid. The result may be death caused by either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation. An LAPD officer described the reaction of a person to being choked as \"do[ing] the chicken\", in reference apparently to the reactions of a chicken when its neck is wrung.\"\n\nThe work of police is to preserve law and order, including the racial order. Hillary Clinton once asked a room full of white people to imagine how they would feel if police and judges treated them the way African Americans are treated. If the police patrolled white communities with the same violence that they patrol poor black neighborhoods, there would be a revolution.\n\nThe purpose of my book, Chokehold , is to inspire the same outrage about what the police do to African Americans, and the same revolution in response.\n\nA chokehold is a process of coercing submission that is self-reinforcing. A chokehold justifies additional pressure on the body because the body does not come into compliance, but the body cannot come into compliance because of the vise grip that is on it.\n\nThis is the black experience in the United States. This is how the process of law and order pushes African American men into the criminal system. This is how the system is broke on purpose.\n\nT here has never, not for one minute in American history, been peace between black people and the police. And nothing since slavery - not Jim Crow segregation, not lynching, not restrictive covenants in housing, not being shut out of New Deal programs like social security and the GI bill, not massive white resistance to school desegregation, not the ceaseless efforts to prevent blacks from voting - nothing has sparked the level of outrage among African Americans as when they have felt under violent attack by the police.\n\nMost of the times that African Americans have set aside traditional civil rights strategies like bringing court cases and marching peacefully and instead have rioted in the streets and attacked symbols of the state have been because of something the police have done. Watts in 1965, Newark in 1967, Miami in 1980, Los Angeles in 1992, Ferguson in 2015, Baltimore in 2016, Charlotte in 2016 - each of these cities went up in flames sparked by the police killing a black man.\n\nThe problem is the criminal process itself.\n\nCops routinely hurt and humiliate black people because that is what they are paid to do. Virtually every objective investigation of a US law enforcement agency finds that the police, as policy , treat African Americans with contempt.\n\nIn New York, Baltimore, Ferguson, Chicago, Los Angeles, Cleveland, San Francisco, and many other cities, the US justice department and federal courts have stated that the official practices of police departments include violating the rights of African Americans. The police kill, wound, pepper spray, beat up, detain, frisk, handcuff, and use dogs against blacks in circumstances in which they do not do the same to white people.\n\nIt is the moral responsibility of every American, when armed agents of the state are harming people in our names, to ask why.\n\nE very black man in America faces a symbolic chokehold every time he leaves his home. The sight of an unknown black man scares people, and the law responds with a set of harsh practices of surveillance, control and punishment designed to put down the threat.\n\nThe people who carry out the chokehold include cops, judges, and politicians. But it's not just about the government. It's also about you. People of all races and ethnicities make the most consequential and the most mundane decisions based on the chokehold. It impacts everything from the neighborhood you choose to live in and who you marry to where you look when you get on an elevator.\n\nI like hoodies, but I won't wear one, and it's not mainly because of the police. It's because when I put on a hoodie everybody turns into a neighborhood watch person. When the sight of a black man makes you walk quicker or check to see if your car door is locked, you are enforcing the chokehold.\n\nYou are not alone. As an African American man, I'm not only the target of the chokehold. I've also been one of its perpetrators. I've done so officially - as a prosecutor who sent a lot of black men to prison. I represented the government in criminal court and defended cops who had racially pro-led or used excessive force. Many of those prosecutions I now regret. I can't turn back time, but I can expose a morally bankrupt system. That's one reason I wrote this book.\n\nBut before I get too high and mighty, you should know that I've also enforced the chokehold outside my work as a prosecutor. I am a black man who at times is afraid of other black men. And then I get mad when people act afraid of me.\n\nOther times I have been more disgusted or angry with some of my brothers than scared. I read the news articles about \"black-on-black\" homicide in places like Chicago and Los Angeles. I listen to some hip-hop music that seems to celebrate thug life. And as a kid I got bullied by other black males. Sometimes I think if brothers would just do right, we would not have to worry about people being afraid of us. I have wondered if we have brought the chokehold on ourselves.\n\nIn my years as a prosecutor, I learned some inside information that I am now willing to share. Some of it will blow your mind, but I don't feel bad for telling tales out of school. I was on the front lines in carrying out the chokehold. Now I want to be on the front lines in helping to crush it.\n\nMy creds to write this book don't come just from my experience as a law enforcement officer, my legal training at Harvard, or the more than 20 years I have spent researching criminal justice. I learned as much as an African American man who got arrested for a crime I did not commit - during the time that I served as a federal prosecutor. I didn't beat my case because I was innocent, even though I was. I beat my case because I knew how to work the system.\n\nThe chokehold does not stem from hate of African Americans. Its anti-blackness is instrumental rather than emotional. As slaves built the White House, the chokehold builds the wealth of white elites. Discriminatory law enforcement practices such as stop and frisk, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs are key components of the political economy of the United States. After the civil rights movement of the 1960s stigmatized overt racism, the national economy, which from the founding has been premised on a racialized form of capitalism, still required black bodies to exploit. The chokehold evolved as a \"color-blind\" method of keeping African Americans down, and then blaming them for their own degradation. The rap group Public Enemy said: \"It takes a nation of millions to hold us back.\"\n\nActually all it takes is the chokehold. It is the invisible fist of the law.\n\nThe chokehold means that what happens in places like Ferguson, Missouri , and Baltimore, Maryland - where the police routinely harass and discriminate against African American - is not a flaw in the criminal justice system. Ferguson and Baltimore are examples of how the system is supposed to work. The problem is not bad-apple cops. The problem is police work itself. American cops are the enforcers of a criminal justice regime that targets black men and sets them up to fail.\n\nThe chokehold is how the police get away with shooting unarmed black people. Cops are rarely prosecuted because they are, literally, doing their jobs. This is why efforts to fix \"problems\" such as excessive force and racial profiling are doomed to fail. If it's not broke, you can't fix it. Police violence and selective enforcement are not so much flaws in American criminal justice as they are integral features of it. The chokehold is why, legally speaking, black lives don't matter as much as white lives.\n\nThe whole world knows that the United States faces a crisis in racial justice, but the focus on police and mass incarceration is too narrow. We might be able to fix those problems the way that we \" fixed\" slavery and segregation, but the chokehold's genius is its mutability. Throughout the existence of America, there have always been legal ways to keep black people down. Slavery bled into the old Jim Crow; the old Jim Crew bled into the new Jim Crow. In order to halt this wretched cycle we must not think of reform - we must think of transformation. The United States of America must be disrupted, and made anew. This book uses the experience of African American men to explain why.\n\nOne of the consequences of the chokehold is mass incarceration, famously described by Michelle Alexander as \"the new Jim Crow\". The chokehold also brings us police tactics such as stop and frisk, which are designed to humiliate African American males - to bring them into submission. The chokehold demands a certain kind of performance from a black man every time he leaves his home. He must affirmatively demonstrate - to the police and the public at large -that he is not a threat. Most African American men follow the script. Black men who are noncompliant suffer the consequences.\n\nThe chokehold is perfectly legal. Like all law, it promotes the interests of the rich and powerful. In any system marked by inequality, there are winners and losers. Because the chokehold imposes racial order, who wins and who loses is based on race.\n\nWhite people are the winners. What they win is not only material, like the cash money that arresting African Americans brings to cities all over the country in fines and court costs. The criminalizing of blackness also brings psychic rewards. American criminal justice enhances the property value of whiteness.\n\nAs the chokehold subordinates black men, it improves the status of white people. It works as an enforcement mechanism for keeping the black man in his place literally as well as figuratively. Oh the places African American men don't go because of the chokehold. It frees up urban space for coffeehouses and beer gardens.\n\nBut it's not just the five-dollar latte crowd that wins. The chokehold is something like an employment stimulus plan for working-class white people, who don't have to compete for jobs with all the black men who are locked up, or who are underground because they have outstanding arrest warrants, or who have criminal records that make obtaining legal employment exceedingly difficult. Poor white people are simply not locked up at rates similar to African Americans. These benefits make crushing the chokehold more difficult because if it ends, white people lose - at least in the short term.\n\nProgressives often lambast poor white people for voting for conservative Republicans like Donald Trump, suggesting that those votes are not in their best interests. But low-income white folks might have better sense than pundits give them credit for. A vote for a conservative is an investment in the property value of one's whiteness. The criminal process makes white privilege more than just a status symbol, and more than just a partial shield from the criminal process (as compared to African Americans). Black men are locked up at five times the rate of white men. There are more African Americans in the US criminal justice system than there were slaves in 1850.\n\nBy reducing competition for jobs, and by generating employment in law enforcement and corrections, especially in the mainly white rural areas where prisons are often located, the chokehold delivers cash money to many working-class white people.\n\nThe chokehold relegates black men to an inferior status of citizenship. We might care about that as a moral issue, or as an issue of racial justice. But honestly, many people will not give a damn for those reasons. African Americans have been second-class citizens since we were allowed - after the bloodiest war in US history and an amendment to the constitution - to become citizens at all.\n\nThe political scientist Lisa Miller has described the United States as a \"failed state\" for African Americans. Indeed some activists involved in the movement for black lives speak of their work as creating a \"Black Spring\", similar to the Arab Spring movements that attempted to bring democracy to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nWe face a crucial choice. Do we allow the chokehold to continue to strangle our democracy and risk the rebellion that always comes to police states? Or do we transform the United States of America into the true multiracial democracy that, at our best, we aspire to be? My book is about the urgency of transformation. All of the people will be free, or none of them will. \"All the way down, this time.\"\n\nCopyright © 2017 by Paul Butler.

      "text": "Democrats work to make sure Black men see their place in Harris's big tent\n\nBlack men remain reliably Democratic in presidential elections, yet talk of defection towards Trump persists\n\nT ravis Foreman, a Black attorney in metro Atlanta , says he's been everywhere on the political spectrum. \"I voted Democrat, I voted Republican, I voted independent, you know, I voted all over the map,\" he said. \"But I personally believe that this country is headed into a very dark place.\n\n\"I know a lot of people believe that Donald Trump is the reason for that dark place,\" he added, \"but I actually disagree.\"\n\nForeman's politics are at the center of a broad conversation about Black men voting for Trump. The only people in America who are less likely to vote for Trump than Black men are Black women. That is the history of Black voters and Democratic presidential candidates over the last 10 election cycles, from Ronald Reagan's second term to today.\n\nAnd yet, talk of defection by an unexpected number of Black male voters to Trump remains persistent. Obama himself has said he finds the focus on Black men and Trump support puzzling.\n\n\"[Harris's] message is directly focused on the challenges that we face as Black men, and that our communities face, and that America faces,\" he said on an organizing call Sunday hosted by Win With Black Men. \"Donald Trump has shown utter disrespect and disregard for our communities - and for Black men specifically - throughout his career.\"\n\nMedia reports citing polling data have suggested that Trump is capturing more Black male voters than previous election cycles. Many of those reports have relied on a statistical aberration in polling data - smaller sample sizes of Black voters within larger polls. As the election evolves in earnest, polls suggest Harris is suddenly recovering to the traditional baseline of Democratic support from Black voters.\n\n\"It's nonsense that Black men are not supporting the vice-president. We are supporting the vice-president. We actually have the data to prove that,\" said Quentin James, CEO of the Collective Pac, a political fundraising organization supporting Black candidates. His organization has been tracking turnout and conducting polling throughout the campaign, he said.\n\nJames noted that Black turnout was softer in Georgia and North Carolina than Democrats would like, particularly among younger voters. Though turnout overall is breaking records, Black voters compose only about 26% of the electorate so far in Georgia - about four points shy of what conventional wisdom in the state suggests is a Democratic win.\n\n\"So as Black men, we need you all to be surrogate fathers for the next nine days,\" he said. \"If you see a Black young person, they are your child, a child of our community. We need you to encourage them to show up and vote for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nRepublican policy objectives stand in stark contrast to the stated social and economic interests widely expressed by Black voters, with a conservative assault on diversity initiatives central to the Trump campaign. The last time Democrats nominated a Black candidate for the presidency, turnout among Black voters increased - proportionately exceeding white turnout in 2012 for the first time in American history. Barack Obama won about 93% of the Black vote.\n\nObama refrained from lecturing Black men for political backsliding on the Sunday call, as well as at a Harris rally in the heart of Atlanta's Black suburbs in Clarkston, Georgia , last week. The former president drew some criticism from a previous appearance in Pittsburgh this month, when he told Black men to get over their reluctance to vote for a woman. Some Black men \"just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, as you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that\", Obama said.\n\nFor Black men who are steadfast Democratic voters, though, the impulse to question the motivations of Black Trump voters looms large.\n\n\"Black men need to grow up,\" said Darryl Manning, a business consultant in Atlanta who cast his vote for Harris on the first day of early voting. \"Black men need to own their communities again. We don't have those leaders any more. We don't have the Malcolm X and the Martin Luther King and the Ralph David Abernathy and the John Lewises any more ... Black women held up, Black women stepped in, and Black women have led our communities.\"\n\nTrump won 12% of the Black vote in 2020. That is close to the high-water mark since the political realignments of the 1960s. Reagan maxed out Republican support among Black voters at 14% in 1980. With the exception of the Obama years, Republicans win a tight band of 8-12% of the Black vote.\n\nThat figure disguises a significant gender gap. Historically, about 15-20% of Black men vote for Republicans, compared with 5-9% of Black women.\n\nTrey Baker, a senior Harris adviser working on Black voter outreach, said it was on the campaign to bring in voters who may have sat out in recent years.\n\n\"We have to take that next step,\" he said. \"Go out and make sure that the disaffected voters, the people who didn't vote last time, the people who don't see themselves in some of these policies and some of these things, show them where they fit in.\""

      "text": "When the media misrepresents black men, the effects are felt in the real world\n\nWe need a nuanced narrative of African-American men, as well as black history, culture and life in America. We are individuals, not types\n\nT he lives of black men in the US have long been adversely affected by negative public perceptions. We are often turned away from jobs because we are not the \"right fit\". While on the streets, we are regularly treated by police as dangerous suspects. Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, described their alleged tussle by testifying: \"when I grabbed him, the only way I can describe it is I felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan,\" even though the two men had the same height.\n\nIn a 2011 study , Media Representations & Impact on the Lives of Black Men and Boys, conducted by The Opportunity Agenda, negative mass media portrayals were strongly linked with lower life expectations among black men. These portrayals, constantly reinforced in print media, on television, the internet, fiction shows, print advertising and video games, shape public views of and attitudes toward men of color. They not only help create barriers to advancement within our society, but also \"make these positions seem natural and inevitable\".\n\nNot much has changed since the 1970s when, as an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, I conducted a study of two metropolitan Detroit dailies' coverage of the 1967 urban riots. Pouring over those yellowing pages of archival newsprint, I discovered notable examples of blatant bias, misrepresentations of facts and poorly substantiated claims about particulars of acts of violence. In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders reviewed coverage of the 1967 riots and faulted many newspapers for their \"exaggeration of both mood and event\" and \"fail[ing] to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and on the under\u001flying problems of race relations.\" The report went on to say: \"They have not communicated to the majority of their audience - which is white - a sense of the degradation, misery and hopelessness of life in the ghetto.\"\n\nThe Opportunity Agenda study also shows that these media distortions are multi-faceted, especially relative to real-world facts. For example, there is an overall under-representation of black men as 'talking head' experts, users of luxury items in print ads and as reliable and relatable characters with fully developed backgrounds in fiction shows and films. Overwhelming evidence exists of exaggerated associations of African-American men to drug-related crime, unemployment and poverty. \"The idle black male on the street corner is not the 'true face' of poverty in America, but is the dominant one in the world as depicted by the media\", according to the study's executive summary. Too many stories associate black men with intractable problems.\n\nMen of color held in esteem by the media, while entirely worthy of praise, too often personify a circumscribed spectrum of human qualities. Prowess in sports, physical achievement in general and musicality are emphasized inordinately. Common role models depicted by the media such as rap or hip-hop stars and basketball players imply limited life choices. When is the last time you have seen a black college professor, doctor, lawyer or scientist selling a product? Many important dynamics that affect black lives, such as a history of economic disadvantage and a prevailing anti-black bias in society, don't often make it to the presses or the screens.\n\nThe Opportunity Agenda study, funded by the Open Society Foundation's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, also showed how these media misrepresentations create problematic attitudes in audiences, not the least of which being a persistent antagonism toward black men.\n\nWhat we are also seeing play out among both white and black people is a hyped view of black boys and men being coupled with criminality and violence, a lack of empathy for black men and boys in trouble, less attention being paid to the bigger picture of social and economic disparity and increased public support of more rigorous approaches to social ills, such as police aggression and longer jail sentences.\n\nIn 2012, professor of political science, Bas W van Doorn at the College of Wooster in Ohio, analyzed images that ran with about 474 domestic US poverty-related stories in Time, Newsweek and US News and World Report from 1992 to 2010. In the images that ran alongside those stories in print, black people were overrepresented, appearing in more than half of the images, despite the fact that they made up only a quarter of people existing below the poverty line during that time frame.\n\nMedia images and words are known, according to the Opportunity Agenda study, to have the greatest impact on the perceptions of people with less real-world experience. People who have never interacted with a black family in their communities more easily embrace what the media tells them. The most negative impact is upon black individuals themselves. Derogatory portrayals can demoralize and reduce self-esteem. In worst case scenarios, black boys and men actually internalize biases and stereotypes and, through their behavior, reinforce and even perpetuate the misrepresentations. They become victims of perception.\n\nNot only does the media's reluctance to provide more balanced perspectives of our African-American male population worsen cultural division among all people, it enables judges to hand out harsher sentences, companies to deny jobs, banks to decline loans and the police to shoot indiscriminately. The mass media is certainly aware of its vast power to shape popular ideas, opinions and attitudes. They should become equally cognizant of their role as a mechanism of social change for the better of all.\n\nLiberal sprinklings of black achievement are not enough to offset an uneven emphasis on the failure of black men. Besides working to eliminate obstacles to African-Americans entering newsroom and television positions, editors must start listening more closely to black constituencies, African-American TV and radio station managers, journalists, film producers and learning from their perspectives.\n\nAll media can and should choose words, images and news angles that give a fuller, more nuanced narrative of African-American men, as well as black history, culture and life in America, as a whole. People of color are individuals, not types."

      "text": "'I had to submit to being exoticised by white women. If I didn't, I was punished'\n\nI support the movement to address misogyny and patriarchy in our society, but it's time for an honest discussion about how some women use white privilege to oppress black men\n\nI 'm going to talk about something that, until now, I have largely kept to myself. It's odd, as I consider myself a writer of extreme honesty, and I try to carry that over into real life. And yet, even now, I'm hesitating, and I realise to some degree I have procrastinated even more than usual about the thinking, and writing, of this. The committing of a hidden life event to the written word. That's always a scary act.\n\nI used to wonder if my reluctance was driven by shame, or simply my incredulity at what took place all those years ago. Now, I think that it is those things mostly, but also a hell of a lot more. Over the last few years, particularly in the recent crosswinds of our racial and cultural political climate, this life event bubbled to the surface of my memory, never quite boiling over. I've talked about it to a few of my close male friends, but that's it. I almost never mention it to women.\n\nSo, OK. I'll stop stalling and try to be as straightforward as I can.\n\nA few decades ago, when I was just becoming a published author, I was discussing projects with various companies. In one, I dealt with a white male creative, and, when he left, I was assigned to someone else, a white woman. I was overjoyed to be taken seriously at last, a bit starry-eyed from the blitz of media and publishing parties, both of which I was unused to. My new contact, charming and jovial, was full of great ideas and encouragement. We hit it off, and got to work right away.\n\nI'd travel into the office several times a week, full of excitement. I was young and eager to change the world. We'd sit in a room together and thrash out story outlines. Almost right away, my editor began making personal comments that I found highly unprofessional. She had black female friends, she said, who would \"love\" me. She said I was cute, and, sometimes when we were sitting at a desk side by side, she would stare into my face when we were meant to be working. It was unnerving, and, while I appreciated the compliments, which would occur every time we worked together, I began to feel a little uncomfortable in her presence.\n\nThen she suffered a small injury. There was a meeting due, and she called me up, insisting that I come to her house. Given what had been going on in the office, I wasn't that keen, so I asked if we could meet in a public place. She refused. We went back and forth until the conversation ended with her screaming down the phone, swearing at me and insisting I came to her house. I refused. The following day, someone in the company rang me up to inform me I had lost the job.\n\nI tried to fight it, but there was nothing I could do. The whole deal collapsed. I knew what had happened to me was a commonplace occurrence for women, and I'd long felt outraged about that reality, but I quickly saw there was no outrage for me. When I spoke to anyone about what happened, there was a sympathetic shrug and a change of subject. So I responded the same way the majority of people would in this situation. I let it go.\n\nIt's clear to me that this incident is an example of white female privilege being used to dominate a young black man. I was perceived to have no recourse, no agency. I had to submit to being exoticised in accordance with the hypersexualised stereotype that black men are often framed by. When I refused to reciprocate, I was punished. It wasn't the first time I had seen this happen, and it wouldn't be the last opportunity I would lose because of something said about me by a white woman. My most recent loss was a university teaching post. The interventions of other students saved my professional reputation, but I lost the job anyway.\n\nMany years after, as the fallout from Harvey Weinstein's behaviour rippled and spread, and the #MeToo movement rose in its wake, I was reminded of my first experience in the media, of negative experiences involving white women from childhood to the present day and of events that happened to friends, or have occurred within the wider diasporic black community. And, although it's obvious that none of my personal experiences come anywhere close to the heinous crimes of rape and enforced sexual harassment committed globally by men, I have seen white privilege used by women as an oppressive tool far too many times to believe there should not be the same level of accountability.\n\nI'll hold my hands up and admit this is a complicated thing to tackle. I know this, and it has in part fuelled my hesitance. So, while I fully support any movement that seeks to address the rampant misogyny and patriarchy driving our society, which of course includes men of colour on too many occasions, I wonder if it's possible to have a conversation about the role white women play in the continual oppression of black men; to speak about this in a historical context, tracing the direct line from enslavement and colonisation to the present day. To have an honest discussion about the fact that white women, who obviously face a cis, white patriarchal system of oppression, also use that patriarchal system to oppress those perceived as lower on the racial and social hierarchy?\n\nI believe we must.\n\nOf course, I'm not writing to generalise a whole race and gender. Many white women do not use their privilege adversely. Many are allies, instrumental in standing beside us, even speaking on subjects such as this. They exist. We see them and acknowledge their presence. That much should be obvious, although I feel it must be stated here to avoid the very real chance of being misconstrued. Still, the fact remains that black men's relationship with white women is fraught with complexity and rarely addressed, except, sometimes, as an examination into the lengths some men go to mine sexual otherness, or exoticism: black men's appreciation sex clubs almost exclusively visited by white women, mock plantation orgies, \"beach boy\" holidays in Africa and the Caribbean. These examinations are usually from a feminine perspective. What's missing is any deep analysis of black male psychology. The mental displacement needed to attend those parties and become a \"bull\" for the night, or be paraded on the arm of a white woman in Hastings, Barbados. Is sex work less morally demeaning if a man is the sex worker and a woman the client? Why is this seen as less mentally destructive, or nuanced?\n\nSocial media is a slippery ally, on occasion doing as much to hinder as help the cause of social justice, but it has been exemplary at charting the numerous cases of white women caught in \"acts of oppression\". The Memphis property manager's insistence that a black man shouldn't wear socks in a swimming pool (she called the police when he refused to leave), for instance. Or the woman who rang 911 after seeing a group of black people barbecuing in a park in Oakland , California. Or the employees who called the police on black men \"loitering\" in a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a friend. And the woman who threatened to report an eight-year-old black girl selling water in San Francisco - and even a Hispanic woman sheltering from the rain in New York.\n\nAt the same time, I have often seen social media posts where black men are accused of having very little to complain about, other than whether white women \"like\" us; if a little thing such as our likability and racism in general were cleared up, black men would declare the problem solved. It's also disappointing how often these declarations are written, and intensely felt, by black women. It seems an odd conflict; on the one hand, social media proves that contact with certain types of white women can ruin your day, if not your life. On the other lies the argument that all black men have to fear is whether we're deemed sexually viable by said women.\n\nAll I can say at this point in time, as a solo writer putting one word after another, is a feeling: intense isolation, vulnerability, the wariness that comes from needing to trust in order to continue with our lives, yet having that trust broken time and again. The fear of being in close proximity with people who may become colleagues, family, lovers, assailants, accusers, abusers or harassers. The danger of loving someone who might possibly racially abuse you in the furious heat of a domestic argument. The confusing seesaw desire of wanting to be an ally for someone's struggle while not having your struggle recognised in return.\n\nAmong my lived experiences, I have had white women punch me for getting on the bus before them, say that I'm not good-looking enough to be a successful writer, rub against me on a packed tube train as if I wasn't even there, and, as I've said above, be instrumental in my losing two jobs that I know of, possibly more that I don't. After that second incident, I was left in freefall, jobless, with a child to raise and a mortgage to pay. Being liked wasn't the issue; my survival was. Something - dumb luck or the spirits of my long-deceased grandmothers - came through for me. I prefer to believe the latter. Throughout it all, and every incident before or since, I have tried to walk as good as I can muster, and live. That's all any black man wants really, to walk in a straight line and to live. Maybe one day we will.\n\nExtracted from Safe: On Black British Men Reclaiming Space, edited by Derek Owusu, published by Orion on 7 March .\n\nThis article was amended on 28 February 2019.

Police and prosecutors had claimed a teenager in a nine-second video in which drill music played was Adedeji, and that a blue bandana worn by the person indicated membership of a group they linked to a revenge plot.\n\nBut in January, after more than three years of being locked up, the court of appeal quashed Adedeji's conviction because the 21-year-old had been wrongly identified.\n\nKeir Monteith KC, who represented Adedeji at appeal, told the Guardian routine use of independent expert witnesses like academics - more typically used for medical or technical matters - could prevent \"racial stereotypes\" around clothing, music and memes being used to shore up prosecutions in which large groups of black defendants are disproportionately held \"collectively responsible\" for the actions of \"one or two\" offenders.\n\n\"In (Adedeji's) case we were able to demonstrate assumptions about the video were completely wrong - one, it isn't him, and two, the person who it was is of good character, with no gang connections.\n\n\"You can't just have barristers or a copper saying 'he's got a blue bandana on, there's drill, he's in a gang' - you need proper safeguards,\" Monteith said.\n\n\"If an expert looked at it, they would be able to say all these things that are factually wrong, these assertions don't fit with the life of this young man.\"\n\nThe law reform charity Justice, intervening in Adedeji's case, has called for new guidelines on the use of evidence, such as drill music, as well as independent expert witnesses.\n\nAdedeji was one of 10 young black men convicted at the same time and two co-defendants have had \"excessive\" sentences reduced.\n\nAt trial, jurors were told \"an interest in drill\" was a reason for involvement in \"gang culture\". While the judge told jurors gang membership and drill did not equal guilt, experts say the system blurs the lines all too often .\n\n\"Cultural evidence\", also used in far-right and religious extremist cases, is believed to be important in proving affiliation and intent by prosecutors.\n\nPatrick Williams, of Manchester Metropolitan University and a leading expert on racism in criminal justice , said that with symbols once associated with gangs - such as hand signs - becoming mainstream, presumption of innocence must be protected.\n\nSign up to The Long Wave\n\nNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"Being in a music video shouldn't be indicative of guilt of a violent conspiracy,\" he added. \"We can't just create a layer of experts who are going to argue for or against once the 'gang' narrative has already been set. There's a reliance on scraping social media to maximise convictions - the threshold for evidence needs to be higher.\"\n\nCalifornia restricted rap lyrics in evidence in 2022. American record executive Keven Liles, the former Def Jam Recordings president, supported Adedeji's appeal, saying the claim that an image of Adedeji holding cash to his ear indicated gang activity showed \"breathtaking\" ignorance of the \"moneyphone\" meme.\n\nDespite finding Adedeji's conviction unsafe, court of appeal judges said the trial judge was not wrong in law in allowing the video and photo in evidence, but said it was vital to avoid \"unfair stereotyping\".\n\nThe case against Adedeji, who was freed after a campaign led by the Manchester anti-racism activist group Kids of Colour , rested largely on 11 messages he sent in a group chat aged 17. He has a place at University of Birmingham to study law, was school head boy, and had addressed parliament before he was wrongly convicted.\n\nThe CPS has said it will change prosecutors' guidance to eliminate racial bias in decision-making, is reviewing how drill music is used, and \"implementing a full national joint enterprise monitoring scheme\". It follows Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, last year admitting \"there have been racial disparities in our legal decision-making\" and apologising."

      "text": "Majority of black people think racism played role in failure to test for prostate cancer\n\nSurvey findings are despite black men being twice as likely to develop the disease than overall population\n\nNearly two-thirds (62%) of black people in the UK believe racial discrimination has prevented them or a loved one from accessing a prostate cancer test, a survey has found, despite black men having twice the risk of developing the disease than the overall adult male population.\n\nA PSA test measures the level of the protein prostate-specific antigen in the blood, and may be able to detect prostate cancer in its early stages.\n\nBut according to a survey conducted by Prostate Cancer Research of 2,000 black adults in the UK, 24% of those who said that either they or a male loved one requested a PSA test in the past year did not have one. Asked why they were not able to access the test, 32% said it was because their GP either refused or said it was not necessary.\n\nScreening for prostate cancer is currently not recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice), which says routine PSA testing \"would generate too many false positives and false negatives ... resulting in potential unnecessary and invasive tests and/or unnecessary treatment\".\n\nThe survey - of 1,000 black women and 1,000 black men - found that just under half (47%) believe they will receive the same level of care from the NHS as a white person. Asked if they believed that racial discrimination had stopped them or a loved one from being routinely screened for prostate cancer, 62% of respondents said yes.\n\nThe report also found that 84% of black people believed there should be more medical research that included black people. A similar figure (83%) agreed that more black people should take part in medical research and 73% said things would only improve if that happened.\n\nBlack men in the UK are at a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than other men. One-quarter of black men will be diagnosed with the disease, compared with one-eighth of all men.\n\nMore than a million men worldwide are diagnosed with the disease each year. The chances of survival are relatively good - 78% of men survive 10 years or more after diagnosis, particularly if diagnosed early. Many can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with 55,100 new cases every year, according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nOliver Kemp, the chief executive of Prostate Cancer Research, said: \"These black and white figures are shocking, and an important call to action. It shouldn't be the community alone who has to fix this - just as we have seen members of the community come together around our Real Talk campaign, we are calling on government, the NHS, and other partners to come together and work with us to close this health gap.\n\n\"It is vital we raise awareness not only among the community, but also among healthcare professionals and policymakers. We are calling on GPs to be mindful of black men's greater risk when considering PSA testing, and on government to introduce screening for men in high risk groups - our data shows that 82% of black men would be willing to take part in such a programme, if it were rolled out. It is staggering to think of how many lives could be saved.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 27 September 2024. An earlier version said that the Prostate Cancer Research report had found that \"one in four black men in the UK\" had been \"refused a prostate cancer test by their GP\". This was not a finding supported by the underlying survey results and has been removed. Also, text has been amended to note that the report surveyed 1,000 black men and 1,000 black women, not \"2,000 black men\"; and to add additional context regarding the Nice guidelines on prostate cancer screening."

      "text": "Dear Black Men (From King To Underdog)\n\nSpiritually Discerned; Doctoral Candidate of Clinical Psychology; Black voice and Male decoder\n\nThe Black Man Is King!\n\nAt this time, I would like to recognize the most powerful and beautiful man on earth , the Black man. Much is said negatively about the Black man but how often do you hear how strong, resilient, intelligent , handsome, and creative that he is? I'll wait...... Exactly my point. Being that the oldest artifacts found were those which were discovered in East Africa, African is constituted as the motherland. Africa is the mother of all mankind . With that being said, it is only rightfully so to say that the first human beings to walk planet earth were BLACK people of African ancestry. This leads me to introduce you to the first woman on earth, Eve, aka, Lucy. The oldest artifacts discovered on planet earth, in the East African location was a woman. The woman being the barrier of civilization makes a great deal of sense. The Black man came from the first woman, who's artifacts were discovered, which makes him the first man to walk planet earth and the father of all mankind. The Black man is the aboriginal man of the planet. For this reason, he is king and he faces a lot of obstacles in life because of it. Many are intimidated by the Black man. White men are the most threatened by the Black man. I witness many cases where White men take the opportunities to try and tear down the Black man and or hate on his characteristics. Before being kidnapped and enslaved in North America, the Black man lived as King and was respected as King. Go to any place in the world and you will see a natural kinglinees embedded in the Black man. Black kings were strategically studied and their strengths were used against them to break down the democracy that was ingrained in them from the soils of the motherland. Due to slavery, racism, discrimination, racial profiling, and democracies created to keep the Black man from thriving, much psychological damage has occurred and the gang violence, thug behavior, theft, violence , etc that you sometimes see, is a result of the Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome that he has experienced. Do not be fooled. The negative image that is painted of the Black man in the media is not who he really is. Who he really is, is a King. Any Black man that is not conveying his kingliness with action is just one who is disconnected to his biological truth. It is in his biological DNA to be a king! For this reason even the most broken , damaged brothas still embodies swag, upright walking and an ego larger than life. Majority of Black men are strong , nice ,fun, brilliant, resilient , passionate, royal men. The media forgets to leave this out when they use countless methods to try and tear him down everyday. For every Black man that has a negative stereotype, I can point you in the direction of five Black men who are wonderfully made. Although Black men have the worst reputation on the planet and are hated by many , there are reasons for this and some of the reasons were listed above. No matter what he does, he is still your father and a son and daughter must respect and honor their parents and if anything, offer a helping hand if you see your parent stumbling. The Black man is your daddy, so respect that man and then just maybe the violence and criminal behavior displayed in some, who are lost will decrease.\n\nDear Black King:\n\nThis letter serves to address that you are indeed a king. However, please don't use this acknowledgment as a reason to have a chip on your shoulder. Please don't use this letter as an excuse to be arrogant, talk down to the sistahs, or believe that you are king dingaling and now you can do what you want and say what you want. Please do not use this letter as a pass to smash everything in sight. Please don't use this letter as a pass to not be chilvrous. Please don't be a time waster. Do not waste a ladies time. Be honest and intentional. Please do not be oversexualized like the media has planned for you to be, in order to keep you from your kingliness. Marry the woman you pursue for sex for a change. Court a woman; love a woman. If you love someone , tell her! Do not be afraid to show your emotions ,nor your heart. Do not play games. Do not be afraid to go after the woman of your dreams.

      "text": "A Woman's Response To 'Straight Black Men Are The White People Of Black People'\n\nBeliever in #blackgirlmagic, a Professor, and committed to all things wellness and self-love\n\n\"I was Black. I was female. And I was out - out - by any construct wherever the power lay.\" ― Audre Lorde\n\nTwo days ago Damon Young from Very Smart Brothas published a piece entitled \" Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People .\" As soon as I read the title, my brain was like. \"Yes, let's talk about it.\" After reading the piece, I thought Damon did an excellent job tackling a difficult and complicated issue, and I was happy that he used his male privilege to help tell our stories.\n\nBlack women have not been allowed to be both Black and female. Historically, we have had to choose our race over our gender, and we have not had the space to express the challenges we face as women. We have not talked about our pain in order to protect our Black men's dignity. We have not been able to be truly feminist, for fear that it disregards, or contradicts, our shared Blackness. We are so worried about the repercussions of discussing our issues with toxic masculinity that we ignore them. So when I saw this piece, I thought maybe, just maybe, that space was being created for Black women to be both Black and female. But my God, after reading the comments, I realized how far we still have to go. So, let me try to break some things down. Y'all know I like lists, so here we go:\n\nI disagree, this analogy is perfect. Absolutely perfect. And let's talk about white privilege for a minute, and I will let you draw your own conclusions. When we try to have conversations around white privilege, a few things happen. First, white people deflect, suggesting that talking about white privilege is separatist because we all have different privileges. Why call out white privilege? All lives matter, right? Second, they discuss struggles they have had as a white person. \"I grew up in a single-family home, I am poor, I was bullied as a kid.\" Somehow, they believe that experiencing adversity takes away their white privilege. And lastly, they say, \"Yes, I have privilege, but that isn't my fault. I didn't choose to be white, why do I have to pay the price? Why do I have to carry the burden of privilege?\" Now, go back above and replace \"white\" with \"male.\" Privilege is a special advantage available to a group of people. I hear our Black men giving the same excuses as white folks, and that is why this analogy works. We have all gotten these tired responses when discussing white privilege, and it is frustrating. So, do you see how ironic it is when you give us the same excuses? Do you see how you are being the \"white people\" of Black people? To push it a step further, I have even heard men say, \"Yes this is a problem, but this isn't the way to express it.\" What is the right way to express it then? Does this not sound eerily similar to white people's critique of the way in which people of color protest, appeal, and organize?\n\nYes, you absolutely do. And Damon made that clear in the beginning of the article. He writes that \"In America, we are near or at the bottom in every relevant metric determining quality of life. Our arrest and incarceration rates, our likelihood of dying a violent death, our likelihood of graduating high school and attending college, our employment rates, our average net worth, our likelihood of surviving past 70.\" We know this, we acknowledge this, and we fight for you. We march for you. We support you. We do not try to argue that this doesn't exist. However, we will not \"give you a break.\" You are not absolved of the responsibility of both acknowledging and uplifting your Black women. Black men have a heavy burden to bear, and you have been taught and conditioned that it is somehow acceptable to dump that burden on Black women. Black men have historically only had power over Black women, so you've made us suffer to help ease your pain. You have disrespected us, you have degraded us, you have silenced us. Yes, slavery, oppression, colonization, and dehumanization can take its toll on your psychological well-being. We get that you are in pain, we are too, and we want to support you. But being in pain is not an excuse to cause pain; we must stop the cycle of abuse.\n\nI am all for calling out propaganda when I see it. But this, beloved, is real. How I wish it was just propaganda. According to a 2017 CDC report, Black women are four times more likely to be murdered than white women. Homicides are the second leading cause of death and over 50 percent of female homicides are committed by intimate partners. In D.C., there has been a string of Black women getting murdered by Black men with no outcry from our Black brothers. But this is just one statistic. Black women are often harassed on the street by Black men who objectify our bodies, and we are taught to be polite and smile to ensure our safety from a young age. We are taught victim blaming, we internalize it, and we try to dress a certain way because only \"respectable\" women deserve respect. I am sorry, Damon's piece is not dividing Black men and women; Black men are dividing us with their own actions, of their own accord. They are doing that when they refuse to date Black women. They are doing it when they call us aggressive, argumentative, or a feminist (which is apparently a bad word) for talking about these issues. And they are doing it when they refuse to acknowledge the role they have played in creating a system that disregards Black women.\n\nYou are right, not all Black men are misogynists. Just like not all white people are racists. But despite this, we still exist in a system that is built on patriarchy, misogyny, and toxic masculinity. And you benefit from this system. So even if you are not engaging in harmful behaviors, if you are not calling them out, you are implicitly guilty. If this is hard for you to understand, think about how you explain a white ally's role in racism. You explain that they benefit from our racially unjust system, and simply not being overtly racist isn't enough. If they accept the benefits of the unjust system and do not try to dismantle it, then they are in turn part of the problem. Again, that is why this white analogy is so perfect.\n\nI would agree with this critique. He did not provide any solutions because it is complicated as hell. Black men were raised and benefit from a patriarchal structure. Dismantling this is going to be hard. But here are some things you can do. Listen to Black women and don't call us aggressive or combative when we tell you about our experiences. Acknowledge our pain, and use your privilege to help us dismantle it. Don't allow people to talk derogatorily about women in your presence. Treat people you date with dignity and respect. This means do not cheat, lie, or steal. Be honest and impeccable with your word. And check your friends when you see them slipping. Make sure you get consent before (and while) engaging in sex. When you see a Black woman being disrespected, defend her. When you hear a story of a Black man beating, cheating, or raping a Black woman, denounce him and his actions clearly. Show us that you support us. Be honest and not defensive. Do some self-evaluation and see how you may be playing out toxic masculinity, and stop. If every Black man made these commitments, we could collectively change this narrative.\n\nOriginally Published at www.DrKristianH.com\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Exploring The Inner Child Trauma of Black Men\n\nFounder & Executive Director of BEAM (Black Emotional & Mental Health Collective)\n\n\" When he would yell at my mother, I would start crying. I didn't know any better. I was only 6. As soon as I started sniffling he would turn around and scream \"Shut up Sean!! Don't be no f*cking punk!\" I was so scared. I was scared he would hate me like I thought he hated my mother. I learned from that to shut up whatever feeling I was goin through. Back then it was fighting other kids. As I got older I would drink, smoke, or just zone it out. Years later being with my own kids made me realize something was wrong. I was angry all the time. I started to see that I had been doing something that was pushing me away from people I cared about....\"*\n\nWhat happens to little Black boys, who learn to hate their feelings? Who do they become? What is the \"inner child\" and how is this all connected? The answers to these questions aren't easy to hear. Nor are they as one dimensional as we might imagine.\n\nThe \"inner child\" represents the emotionality and perceptions we learned as children that, if left un-engaged, we carry on as adults. For all Black children, our inner perceptions can be informed by a number of traumatic experiences . Despite this, African American Americans overall are not likely to access mental health services, much less Black men. This creates a considerable challenge: On one hand Black men and boys are traumatized constantly. But on the other hand, we are not given emotional tools to transform that pain. We are taught, like Sean, masculine norms that do not support mental health. The consequence of this is evident: climbing rates of suicide, abuse, and assault against ourselves, Black women and Black gender non-conforming individuals.\n\nTo explore this further, I spoke with Washington D.C based Therapist Douglas Gotel. Gotel has been working with African American men and boys for nearly 10 years and had much to say on how inner childhood trauma is playing a role in Black men's lives.\n\nAkili: How do you see child trauma impacting Black men and boys?\n\nGotel: Trauma literally changes the emotional map in the brain, it alters perception. Left unaddressed, these emotional imprints can negatively impact perceptions held by Black men (and any person); perceptions of self, others and circumstances that can cause problems in every relationship in a person's life. For men, it often manifests as anger or rage, a product of fear and powerlessness.\n\nAkili: How have you seen inner child trauma show up in working with adult African American men?\n\nGotel: I remember a time as an intern on a home visit, witnessing what unresolved inner child trauma looked like in vivo. I was visiting with a single father who was doing the best he could trying to raise his teenage son to keep him out of foster care. Their relationship was, in a word, combustible. As I look back on that home visit, what I witnessed were two people with unmet needs, two child states in conflict. A young man, who had been abandoned by his mother, his defiance fueled by competition with his father's girlfriend for his father's attention; a father, who could not read, conflicted with wanting nurturing and attention from his girlfriend and feeling his authority challenged by an acting-out teen. Both had childhood traumas of parental separation.\n\nThe young man had skipped school the day before and I arrived in the middle of an altercation between father and son. The father literally had a tantrum before me. He was jumping up and down, stomping, fists clinched, screaming at the young man saying, \"You don't appreciate anything I do for you!\" The best I could do in that moment was to create some space between them before it got physical. The father, with his own emotional needs, was not ready developmentally to parent. This is one way that unresolved childhood trauma can show can show up in relationships, explosive anger. When we are faced with unmet needs, particularly attachment needs of feeling safe, secure, comforted and validated from those with whom we have community, how we respond to those unmet needs is reflective of the degree that our inner child has been nurtured.\n\nAkili: What can we as adult Black men do to address and deal with our inner child trauma?\n\nGotel: One thing that Black men can do to help to resolve inner child trauma is to cultivate awareness of our systems of meaning. What I mean by that is the ability to recognize when behavior reactions to someone else's behavior are being seen through the lens of adverse childhood experiences. Awareness is the antidote to impulse. Awareness puts you in a position to choose-a different way of thinking, a different behavior. In order to heal, you have to open up the emotional baggage, suppressed material of past hurts and confront it. Feel it. Name it.\n\nAkili: What would you say to Black men who feel this work is not important?\n\nGotel: To Black men who feel this work is not important, I say watch the local evening news. The local headlines are rife with stories about felony crimes-domestic violence, murder- There is always a back story pointing back to a \"troubled childhood,\" unresolved childhood trauma. There has been a great cost to communities and families already when the emotional needs of Black men and men in general are disregarded and the emotional expression of Black men is stifled by messages such as \"be a man,\" \"man up,\" or \"big boys don't cry.\"\n\nAkili: What do we as people who love Black men, need to do to help Black men and boys grow emotionally and heal? What's the best way we can be supportive in creating a healing community?\n\nGotel: What we must do above all things is preserve childhood and ensure that parents across the spectrum of financial affluence have the tools and means to make home an extended learning environment for their kids; that Black boys and Black girls-all children-experience enough of the \"Crucial C's\" in childhood that build resilience and a healthy sense of self as they face life's challenges and changes.\n\nAll children need four interpersonal experiences regularly in childhood to develop a healthy sense of self. These are the four Crucial C's developed by psychologists Amy Lew and Betty Lou Bettner that I refer to often in my work.\n\nWe all need to feel Connection (I belong), Capable (I can do it), I Count (I matter, I can make a difference) and Courage (I can handle what comes). When children don't experience enough of the Crucial C ' s, they will act out in any of the four ways: Attention seeking, revenge, power/control or avoidance/withdrawal. When Black boys act out, the penalties and stigmatization is greater. We can ensure healthy social-emotional development of Black boys by providing experiences with Crucial C ' s.\n\nAkili: The message is clear: the little boys in all of us are begging to be reconciled with. Black boys in this country need our support in cultivating and maintaining emotional literacy. Black men need to get support in cultivating healthy emotional lives. This is a pressing priority for the wellness of the Black community. If national entities can build campaigns to support Black men and boys with ties, business suits and coding skills, then we can do the same with teaching emotional literacy that is informed by Black feminist and Womanist theory. Because all the other things are useless if they only serve to remake us into emotionally dead patriarchs who cannot nurture our families and communities. Our communities need black men, all Black men -gay, heterosexual, trans, disabled-to show up and be present, and be loving full adults. The inner child in you needs the same.\n\nAbout The Therapist:\n\nDouglas Gotel, LICSW, RPT is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and a Registered Play Therapist.\n\nHe maintains a private practice in Washington, D.C. and has extensive experience providing behavioral health services in school settings and community-based settings as both as a clinician and administrator.

      "text": "Black Man Gonna Be a Black Man - That's How They Do\n\nCoach, author, blogger, advocate\n\nAnd who could dispute Aunt Ruby's wisdom, her unassailable knowledge? Who was more worldly than this semi-literate, six foot two, big-chested dark brown Amazon of a woman, who'd escaped South Carolina's cotton fields at thirteen, migrated north during the depression, and reinvented herself as a respected (although still semi-illiterate) businesswoman at fifty? Who better than Aunt Ruby to mold my young questioning mind? If ever there was a stereotypical, quintessential African-American Big Mamma, all wise, all knowing, and then some, it was Aunt Ruby.\n\nFor years I took for granted her marginalized, archaic view of the black man, murmuring along with thousands upon thousands of my chocolate sisters nation-wide in condemnation of that despicable, but oh, so desirable, Mandingo.\n\nBut, is that really just how they do? I was torn, knowing instinctively that there were good black men out there and I needn't look any further than my father or my Uncle Jay, Aunt Ruby's husband who loved her more than life. What well-spring had birthed her Rubyisms? And, if the Black Man was so incredibly worthless, why did so many sisters yearn for him, jones for him like some bad habit, albeit berating themselves for being so vulnerable to his many charms? What was it about this enigmatic black man that generated love and loathing at the same time? That attracted a sister like fine, aged wine, yet simultaneously repelled a sister to the point of denouncing everything about him, from the way he walks (. . . struts really) to the way he talks (hmmm. . . more like a purr), to the way he performs sexually?\n\nAunt Ruby's views, tainted and malodorous, had been passed down, griot-style, as truth from one brokenhearted woman to the next, twisted with more fable than fact, demeaning and defining generations of black men on color alone, ignoring the fact that first and foremost, black men are simply men, prone to the same imaginings, strengths and weaknesses of every other race of men that walk this planet. Men, who have no monopoly on different or strange, but a shared history of oppression. A history, nevertheless, which does not nullify the fact that black men are, and will forever be, simply men. And as all women should understand by now, (but many sadly do not) most men think and act differently than women. They are not women with penises. They are men.\n\nMy journey into debunking Aunt Ruby's how they do's, came to these conclusions:\n\nBlack men don't listen to their women . Men really do listen, albeit seemingly in a nonchalant way. However, a barrage of b.s., accusations and put-downs is a universal turn-off, inclusive of all men. How, and when you show up determines a lot about how your man interacts with you. Consequently, don't interrupt a championship game in the last inning to talk about your feelings. \"We need to talk\" begets silence. Game over.\n\nBlack men cheat on their women. Any relationship not built upon trust, friendship, commitment, and a heavy dose of integrity leaves itself open to outside influences that can shipwreck it in a moment's notice. Both sexes in all races are known to fall short of total commitment. This accusation should not fall squarely on the black's man's shoulders. Black men don't take care of their families. . . . That's how they do . True, some don't, for numerous reasons and too little time to explain (try researching slavery's impact on disposable black families). The key question here, however, is whether or not your man has the potential to be a great husband and father. And, if you're with a man who shows any signs of being unable to adequately fulfill the role, why are you with him? The answer to this question is not, that's how all black men do. The answer is, \"I promise myself I'll pick and choose with utmost care.\" Black men want sex 24/7. All men love sex. Period. Black men, white men, Asian men, all men around the world. Men think of sex day in and day out; straight sex, gay sex, menage' a trois , and everything in between. Now that's how they do. Outside of working, eating and sports, men think of sex; (and sometimes while eating, working and playing sports). Men think of sex as much as women think of shoes, fashion and hairdos. Stereotypical? Yes, But don't fool yourself, women think of sex quite often, more than a lot of us are willing to admit.\n\nBlack men don't respect black women . Really? Most men respect their mammas, and while they may desire a freak in the bed, in public, they want a queen by their side. Respect is earned and gaining that depends upon how we carry ourselves. In other words, act like a slut, expect to be treated like one, and you'll never get to meet his mamma.\n\nBlack men are selfish lovers . Which begs the question, how many black men have you slept with to come to that conclusion? If the answer is \"enough\" then clearly it's time to examine why you're choosing selfish men. Remember, you picked him.\n\nAnd my personal favorite:\n\nBlack men will jump over ten black women to get to a white woman . Unfortunately, some brothers have viewed a Becky as a status symbol, but when marrying interracially, trends report that black men choose Asian and Hispanic women more so than white women, and these percentages are still low. Regardless, the percentage of interracial marriages, however, is approximately twelve percent. The fact remains that who we love and how we love are more personal choices than racial choices, and our choices, seem at times, to defy logic. The heart wants what the heart wants, and acts as an agent all on its own, answering to no one, making inexplicable choices that surprise even us. Lovelings, in this diverse, multi-cultural world we live in, love comes in whatever hue and color we find it.\n\nWhat a marvelous epiphany at the end of my musings. I finally realized Aunt Ruby's rambling disjointed list of the black man's how they do's were actually applicable to all men. . . everywhere. They were the protective wrappings we women clothed our hearts with, shielding us against the inevitable pain that can touch any relationship. He cheats? Well, that's how they do . . . Let's not examine the relationship to get to the core of the problem; He doesn't listen? Well, humph! That's how they do . This had nothing to do with race, and everything to do with our inability to connect to that special someone we choose to love; everything to do with longing and loving and hoping like hell that he loves to the extent we do; everything to do with butterflies in the pit of our stomachs and that inexplicable joining that moves from heart to loins. A feeling, so tantalizing, it takes your breath away. Because, ladies, that's how we do.\n\nMari's article was featured in \"The Dating GPS: Guys-Pricks-Sweethearts,\" one of Amazon's top-selling guides on relationships.

      "text": "My Response To 'Straight Black Men Are The White People of Black People'\n\nEducational Consultant and Cultural Critic & Curator\n\nThe two most insulting gibes you, as a Black person, can hurl at another are to talk about \"yo mama\" or call them White, especially if what you're saying is right. They are guaranteed fighting words in any corner of Black America. The receiver will vehemently lambast the offender to edify themselves and draw a wedge between their character and the quip. My Big Mama would simply say, \"a hit dog will holler.\" And, holler did dozens of Black men this week after reading Damon Young's VSB article Straight Black Men are the White People of Black People .\n\nBefore you continue reading, there are three facts with which you must be familiar and agree. Otherwise, you'd only be reading to feed your frustration and gain traffic for me.\n\nIf you know these facts to be true, then continue onward.\n\nFine AF Kofi just because\n\nWhen the article first stamped my timeline, I figured it was \"click bait;\" some spoof of our feelings. No one dared tell this truth, especially not a straight Black man. So, I kept it scrolling. It danced its way into my newsfeed again, this time shared multiple times by people whose opinion I respect. Finally, it was posted in a forum I manage specifically for Black women to focus on our complete healing and restoration. I immediately felt hopeful. I knew if it were there, in our sacred space, it had to be or lead to uplift for US all. (The big \"US,\" as in all Black folks.) That's not only the mission of our group, but the main rule of engagement.\n\nSo, I opened the link and cautiously expected to get my life. No doubt, anything presented in the article would have been voiced by Black women long before now, but now a man, a Black man, was saying it. This had to mean we were being heard. He was selected as the Black male delegate of the week to usher in a wave of honest and transparent dialogue to help us all do and be better! Kofi Siriboe was busy being fine. Michael Smith had just demonstrated his public support of us. Jay Z had all other relevant Black men busy screening life-changing mini documentaries as an appendix for 4:44. So, Damon Young was selected as tribute. Yes, this was it! Black men and Black women were about to \"call a thing a thing\" and heal ourselves. Bring it Beloved!\n\nI read, \"Intraracially, however, our relationship to and with black women is not unlike whiteness's relationship to us. In fact, it's eerily similar,\" and I fainted a little bit.\n\nQueen mother fainting\n\nThen he hit me with, \" But when black women share that we pose the same existential and literal danger to them that whiteness does to us;....their words are met with resistance and outright pushback.\" And, this was me:\n\nQueen Viola Davis\n\nFinally, a man, a Black man said everything we've whispered in our closets or prayed to be released from or suffered attacks for thinking aloud. There is now a concrete validation from one of our reflections that we are not evil or ignorant for voicing disdain when we are hurt by Black men, murdered by Black men, raped and assaulted by Black men, harassed by Black men, dismissed by Black men, overlooked (for White women) by Black men, antagonized by Black men, patronized by Black men, underpaid compared to Black men, unheard by Black men. This was a victory and a step towards our collective progress....I thought.\n\nThen, Black men, our kings, our confidantes, husbands (thankfully, not mine), sons we've raised singly in many cases, responded ready to fight. One brother said simply, \"it was offensive.\" I saw his offense and raised awareness to our murders, rapes, and assaults. Another angrily posted that it's not possible because Black men aren't free; as though oppression is not layered and you cannot experience privilege if you're also oppressed. Their sentiments were even echoed by some of our sisters. And, the collective deflation of Black women resonated through timelines and inboxes, private forums and chat rooms. A brother writes a piece critically assessing Black men's engagement with Black women. Black women raised their heads in awe that someone other than they \"gets it\" and feel this could move in the direction of healing, healthy dialogues, and progress. Black men responded overwhelmingly with discourse and, ironically, proved every assertion in said article correct. Black women got back to work on just themselves because we're still not ready to work together. Still.\n\n\"We all we got,\" was the refrain and it has come to mean that our internal critiques from which we are disallowed must be met with swift and venomous retort, else all the work we've done to pretend we are well in order to prevail will become undone. The responses read like a parody themselves. It has been surreal. Every response could've easily been scripted for a White person to say in response to being accused a racist. When I read them, I recited the internal dialogues Black women have been having for years that halts us from ever addressing Black men about their shortcomings:\n\nYou have to be gentle when talking to Black men or they'll be offended. You mean like White people?\n\nThey take offense to being called sexist, ignoring the basis for the assertion altogether.

      "text": "Don't Hate Me Because I'm Not Dating Other Black Men\n\nJournalist, blogger and author, 'Is It True What They Say About Black Men?'\n\nLeroy McClain and Charlie Barnett in The Happy Sad\n\n\"Never in my life have I read a book so filled with self-hatred. Can ' t believe I made it all the way through. The author ' s obsession with white men is troubling. \"\n\nOuch. That's a recent one-star review of my book Is It True What They Say About Black Men?: Tales of Love, Lust and Language Barriers on the Other Side of the World . You know what they say about criticism: A single scathing assessment stands out in one's mind more than a dozen glowing ones.\n\nThis one, though, didn't say anything new - nor did it make me second guess my work. He read the entire book. Clearly it's not my work he finds offensive. It's me.\n\nAlas, he's not alone. His commentary resonates like a broken record that's been on repeat as long as I've been writing about sexual racism : Apparently, as a black man, I owe it to myself and to black men everywhere to date inside my race only. Imagine the uproar that would ensue if a white person dared to utter such stick-with-your-own-kind nonsense to another white person. He or she would be nailed to the proverbial cross.\n\nFrankly, as a gay black man, I'm over the presumptions of self-hatred. Of all the things I would change about myself if I could, being gay and being black are not two of them. I consider both to be badges of honor . They've made me who I am, and I couldn't love me more. That said, there are nights when I go to bed and dream of waking up the next morning and experiencing 24 hours in which my race isn't a factor in pretty much every aspect of my gay life, from who hits on me to who doesn't.\n\nThat's right. It's not just about who doesn't want me. I write about sexual racism from the point of view of someone who is regularly pursued because of my skin color (sigh... here it comes again - more objectification and the dreaded big black fantasy) and has never been outright rejected because of it. Like people of every color, I have no control over who pursues me. If I dated black men only, many of my stories would be the same. I'd still regularly hear from tone-deaf non-white men who think \"I love black men\" is a personal compliment.\n\nBut then, if I dated black men only, I would have missed out on the Asian and Latino men I've dated and been with while living outside of the United States in countries where the miniscule black population would have made my options virtually non-existent. (Would anyone go to Argentina, Thailand, or Australia to \"obsess\" over black men?) Some of those Asian and Latino men probably wouldn't appreciate being lumped in with the white men I allegedly \"obsess\" over. One of them carried scars from being a darker-skinned South American and therefore, in the eyes of his family and community, inferior, to his more European-/white-looking brother.\n\nI've been loudly critical of people who adopt hierarchies of skin color and those who banish entire races and ethnicities from their dating and sexing pool. I stand by everything I've written. But that's different from telling people what color their boyfriends should be. Boyfriend shaming wasn't cool when Carrie Bradshaw's therapist did it (in the Sex and the City episode where the heroine hooked up with a hunk who looked a lot like Jon Bon Jovi), or when the sister of Samantha Jones's black beau did it (revisit her tirade in the video below), and it's even more infuriating when total strangers do it.\n\nFor the record, ruling in or ruling out someone based solely on race and putting it in writing on Grindr, or wherever, is racist. So is telling a black man that he's less of a person and full of self-hatred because he's not dating other black men.\n\nThe great irony here is that a white man who dates interracially will often be regarded as colorblind and progressive, whether it's by active choice or simply by chance. But where would they be without men of other races who would date them? If I must date in my own lane, does that mean whites, Asians, Latinos, Jews, Arabs, etc., need to as well? How is this brand of romantic segregation any more acceptable than other forms of racial segregation?\n\nFor those who think dating within your race will make you luckier in love, look around. Non-interracial couples don't necessarily stay together forever. And black men are not the ultimate romantic saviors, my mother and sister can attest to that. Dating them may change the racial dynamics of my relationships, but the racial dynamics of my relationships have been just fine.\n\nI've never been physically or mentally abused by a non-black boyfriend. The relationships may not have worked out, but race has never been a factor in any of my breaks-ups. And I do not buy the argument that black men will \"get me\" more than white men will. Yes, they may be able to better understand some of my experiences as a black man, but my experiences as a black man are not all there is to me. There's so much more to a healthy loving relationship than mutual understanding of what it's like to be a certain color.\n\nAnd there's no guarantee a black man would even understand my specific experiences with racism and discrimination, which, ironically enough, began not with white people but with black people. The first time I ever heard the N-word, in first grade, a black classmate was hurling it at me - and not in the \"N―-a\" sense. I instinctively knew it was something bad, and when I asked what he meant, he told me it was a word for tall people.\n\nDespite growing up in Kissimmee, Florida, a hotbed of racism in the '70s and '80s, it was the black kids, not the white kids, who picked on my siblings and me for years, routinely beating us up after school because of our strange Caribbean accents. (I was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands.) They said we talked funny, too proper, like we thought we was better than they were. We had to be put in our place.\n\nEvery time I read a critique slamming me because of my white dating history, I flash back to the black schoolyard bullies who, were they around today, would probably concur. Racism and discrimination against me by white people and by black people - especially by black people - defined my formative years. So excuse me if I don't feel a magical connection to black men just because they're black.\n\nThat doesn't mean I couldn't fall in love with one. I've been with black men, and while I've yet to give my heart to one, I'd never rule it out the way all those people on Grindr rule out Asians, citing \"preference.\" I must admit, though, that my past looms over my present. My experiences with black Americans changed considerably in college when I started regularly meeting black people my age who didn't give me side-eye and a fist, but damage had been done. Although I no longer harbor the fear I had when I was growing up, my early black-on-black experiences still affect me on some level. Today, I feel as much an outsider among black people as I do among white people. I'm not looking for black ripples in the white sea.\n\nDuring my high-school days, back when I was still facing off with black bullies, my brother and my sister had a big blow-out over the white girls he kept dating. My sister considered it an insult to her, to our mother, and to black women everywhere.\n\nFast forward decades. My brother has been happily married for more than 13 years to a woman, a black woman, with whom he shares three children. On the day of their wedding, my sister's longest and most successful relationship had been with a white man, a lovely guy who never broke her heart - unlike pretty much every black boyfriend preceding him.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "More Black Men Are Dying By Suicide. We Need To Address It.\n\nOn May 3, Lance Blanks , a retired NBA player who spent the rest of his career as an NBA executive and an analyst for an ESPN affiliate network, died by suicide . He was 56.\n\n\"But the fact is we will never truly know why. And we don't need to. All we need to do is remember him, honor him, celebrate him and pour our love into the family that made him happy,\" his daughter Riley Blanks Reed wrote in a tribute to him on ESPN . \"All we need to know is that, oftentimes, the people in the most pain are the giants in our lives.\"\n\nBlanks is highest-profile Black male celebrity to have died by suicide since dancer and frequent \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" contributor Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss, who died in December .\n\nI'm aware a lot of Black folks still harbor that woefully anachronistic \"suicide is for white folks\" mentality. But there have been several prominent Black male deaths by suicide in recent years: former NFL wide receiver Charles Johnson, former Hyattsville, Maryland, Mayor Kevin Ward and Ian King Jr., the son of Regina King.\n\nJohnson and Ward were 50 and 44, respectively, but the young people in our ranks appear to be in particular danger: Black youth have seen the fastest-rising suicide rates among any ethnic group in the last 20 years, with suicide among Black male youths rising 60% in that period.\n\nSuicides among Black Americans of all ages might also be extremely undercounted, for multiple reasons all connected to racism .\n\nBoss' suicide rocked many people who weren't even familiar with his work, mainly because it appeared on the surface that all was well: a loving wife, Allison Holker Boss (with whom he danced on Instagram Live a day before his death), three children and a gig that paid well and kept him in the public eye.\n\nTo understand suicide is to know that it doesn't much matter how people appear on the surface .\n\n\"No one had any inkling that he was low. He didn't want people to know,\" Allison Holker Boss told People earlier this month . \"He just wanted to be everyone's Superman and protector.\"\n\nThat, essentially, sums up the Black man's struggle with mental health. We're expected to ride for everyone else without looking out for ourselves.\n\nBlack men have a fraught relationship with mental health unlike that of any other ethnic or gender group . It starts with a health care industry that has historically mistreated all Black people and continues to demonstrate inequity in treatment today.\n\nThere's also the issue of men of all ethnicities placing mental health in the backseat of priorities. Even in 2023, with all that we know about the benefits of protecting our mental health, stoicism is still expected of men in lieu of expressing \"feminine\" emotions. (Do your job! Put Peg A into Slot B and don't cry about it!)\n\nThat unholy combination has left us with a bunch of Baby Boomer Black men who wouldn't think of dropping coins to talk to a stranger about their feelings. It's the living demographic that has probably experienced more potent racism in America than anyone else keeping emotions bottled in.\n\nHow do we deal with this problem? The very first thing is destigmatizing mental health and recognizing that suicide is not \"quitting.\" I'd argue this is one of the toughest issues for Americans to reconcile.\n\nNext is to understand and embrace that the seeds of the Black man's plight were planted centuries ago, and those trees have yet to be cut down. We remain far more likely to die or suffer the impacts from gun violence . We remain less likely to graduate college than even our Black female counterparts. We suffer a host of health maladies unique to us , and so on.\n\nThese aren't your fault, Black men.\n\nIt's also important to understand that, despite what a bunch of viral posts with 20-somethings adjudicating what constitutes \"masculine behavior\" have to say about the matter, we're still human beings who feel things. Look no further than the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna to remember how collective we were in our feelings.\n\nFinally, we need to understand the value of therapy. I know how tough it can be to step away from the compartmentalization that's a literal method of survival for some of us. But cracking your chest open to an impartial third party with the training to help you can pull you out of a hole - I'm living proof of this.\n\nIt's still tough to find licensed Black male therapists, but Psychology Today lets you narrow the search down . Depending on where you live, there are free nonprofit safe spaces designed specifically for Black men, like ones developed by therapist Femi Olukoya in Houston .\n\nI love seeing more famous Black men speaking out in support of therapy, including Will Smith and \" The Breakfast Club 's\" Charlamagne tha God. Jerrod Carmichael's 2022 stand-up special \" Rothaniel\" was more of a refreshing therapy session than a gut-busting comedy romp - I believe more of that energy will motivate us in the right direction.\n\nMost of us don't have Carmichael's platform of millions to get the monkey off our back, and even if we did, most of us wouldn't speak to the world about our issues. But speaking to someone is necessary if you're experiencing depression or suicidal ideation.

      "text": "Why Black Men Loving Black Men Is Still A Revolutionary, Suicidal Act\n\nAuthor, Theorist, BlaQueer Griot, Howard Law 2017\n\n\"Black Men Loving Black Men Is the Revolutionary Act of the 1980s\"\n\n-Joseph Beam\n\nThe first time I happened upon the quotation by the great Joseph Beam, it did a work on my spirit. I was just shy of 16 and almost delivered from the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), yet still an occasional, holy rollin' backslider; the oil was too strong. To my young soul, it illuminated the possibility of a self and communal love that didn't lead to the burning or gnashing of flesh, but instead to a fire that melted oppression, causing black men to spring forth clean and powerful as an onyx Phoenix. Just shy of 16, I was already grown, but Joey B gave me a new lease on life, I moving from closeted to confident. That was 2005. It's now 2016.\n\nIn the decade since, something in me has changed. I won't say I'm grown quite yet, but I have grown into a deeper understanding of self, sex and the practice of love. I have come to understand that to revolt, or to inspire revolution, means to act, live, love, think, fuck and die in opposition to an entrenched system while midwifing one of a liberatory nature-with the power to undo all that you think you are-all remaining true and whole to self, eschewing the notion of an \"other.\" Revolution will undo you. If it does not, you have not yet revolted within or, put simply, unbecome what hegemonic, white supremacist, capitalistic, heteropatriarchal society has branded upon your flesh and psyche. The iron is hot and it's markings are not easily removed. Therefore, internal revolution is nothing short of psychosocial laser removal treatment-from thought to flesh. For black men, this requires a role-reversal and an expertise in survival jujitsu and imaginative reconstruction.\n\nBlack Men Loving Black Men...\n\nThis quotation is recited at every black gay/sgl/bi/dl/_______ conference and is generally followed by snaps, smiles and a high/low chorus of YASSSSSS! But what is often heard, understood and practiced is fucking, not loving, or even lusting. If we look closely we can understand the complex relationship between black men as a collective practice of fucking; a rough, quick, thorough, sweaty and primal intercourse that offers short-term relief for a long term desire, repeated over time, in almost any space we enter. The relationship between our sociopolitical bodies, our selves, brother-to-brother become a practice of orientation. More often than not, we measure our masculinities, femininities, wealth, worth, humanity and desirability in opposition to those around us. We do so, acting as if the beauty and bounds of blackness are limited, and our preferred place in the imaginary spectrum of humanities can only be secured by the expulsion or demotion of another black brother. The thinking then goes, that there can only be so many \"good\" and \"worthy\" or \"real\" black men. To think otherwise strikes at intermingled notions of the children of capitalism-the exceptional negro/talented tenth mythology (ex: Barack/Oprah)-and white supremacy-the inherent/imputed deficiency of blackness (ex: controlling images: laziness, violence, hypersexuality).\n\nAnti-Blackness is a convenient, socially constructed covering of white supremacy, white anxiety and white violence.\n\nBlack men, like all male-bodied folks, are given situational power and privilege in relation to women and femmes of their racial location. It must be clearly noted that black men-across space, time, class and sexuality-have used this privilege and access to power, to both uplift and more often than not, decimate black women. This has been completed and articulated by the masses as black men accessing and appropriating (white) patriarchy. This is true. However, I posit that it is directly linked to the concept of racial inferiority-a child of white supremacy, a sibling of anti-blackness-that implicitly notes that in order for black men to access  \"humanity,\" we must first differentiate ourselves from other black people (read: women, womyn, queers, trans* folk, ect). Differentiating and othering in the United States is marked by power and power is understood through the demonstration of a marked inability to be oppressed and owned; while simultaneously, ruthlessly portraying that power, through the ability, desire and provision of oppression, ownership and propertying of the othered. Through this violent quest for power, and perhaps the illusion of freedom, black men as a group are marked as violent, hyper-sexual, immoral, criminal and in need of state-control/lashing. The prophecy, markings, and controlling images of white supremacy and anti-blackness become proven by the actions of black men, performing these lip synced lyrics and scripts from the master's tongue.\n\nViolence upon, and violations of/through, the black male body are the preferred redemptive practice of the 21st century.\n\nAside from black women―often learned through black/white male cisheteropatriarchy―black men are the primary target of black male patriarchy and power-lust. Sexism is well embedded in society, therefore, the greatest actual threat to a black man's access to (white supremacist) power in the black community is another black man. This conversation and theory is well fleshed out in bell hook's \"We Be Real Cool\" and Richard Majors and Janet Mancini Billson's \" Cool Pose : The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America.\" Both speak to the ways in which black men across age protect themselves-through violence, silence and other performances-against the indignities of white supremacy, anti-blackness, poverty, masculine anxiety and discrimination in their communities. We are taught to prove our worth through the devaluation and violation of other black men. In these practices of violence, distancing and differentiation we are positioned as distinct, if not circumcised, from the collective \"bad\" black body. We are the strong, the smart, the responsible, the tolerant, the feminist, the queer, the anti-racist, the well-read, the masculine, the christian...the last buffer against the highly contagious other. We are given purpose, we are given worth, we are given pseudo-whiteness, through our performance, perfection and articulation of anti-blackness and internalized white supremacies. To do otherwise-articulating or demonstrating a \"soft\" pose, or denunciation of this parasitic cycle-can leave a brother isolated, ostracized, bloodied and/or dead.\n\n...Is The Revolutionary...\n\nFlipping the script is both revolutionary and radical. It is a revolt against all that has been designated as \"blackness\" and radical-or grasping at the root-of the tenants of white supremacy and anti-blackness. Transgressing this ideology and ethic, with a practice of love is not only unheard of, but an unnatural practice in a white supremacist state. This is certainly true if we begin to use my dynamic conception of a critical love ethic : \"a practice of universal liberation from cyclical and systemic violence and oppression...we must look deeply and examine the oppressor within, dare to love those who we see as threats or \"other\" and question whether the threat is real, imagined or internal. This is a call for a human solidarity across and beyond racialized differences and an ethic of love that first acknowledges our shared humanity and endeavors to reify that shared notion.\" As I stated in earlier piece on love among black men, we must begin to reconstruct our notions of self, our relationship to others, brothers and sisters.\n\n\"The reactionary suicide is 'wise,' and the revolutionary suicide is a 'fool,' a fool for the revolution in the way Paul meant when he spoke of being a 'fool for Christ,' That foolishness can move mountains of oppression; it is our great leap and our commitment to the dead and the unborn.\"\n\n- Huey P. Newton, I Am We, or Revolutionary Suicide\n\nWe must engage in communal euthanasia of blackness as we've accepted it and come to practice and believe that:\n\n\"The tea is, blackness is the essence of creation, a potpourri of the creative ingredients of existence. Blackness, unbought, unbossed and unrestrained is the building block of color and from its presence, our presence, your presence, derives all things. ...\n\n....Flesh deep, varied and enduring as that of the earth on which we stand. Arms strong and versatile enough to hold masculinities, femininities and the journey of ancestors close. You are rhythmic, moving through the compounded obstacles of society step-by-step, death-dropping over stigma, tossing shade to the bright lights of white supremacy and sashaying truths of our over-comings through your very existences...\n\nYou are a soul ballad; stitching together the complex realities of our fraught existences with an in-articulable presence that commands and requires respect, resolve and r/evolution. You are a Cosmos; within you exists a constellation of brilliant expressions of perfect imperfections.\n\nYou are queer,str8, trans, gay, bi, same-gender-loving, undefined: simply you. You are father, son, brother, uncle, cousin, and homie. You are truth-seeker, griot, artist, scholar, activist, organizer, writer, singer, designer, athlete, lawyer, educator, trend-setter, and him. You are him. He who is sensitive yet indestructible, authentic yet ever-evolving, sexually breathtaking and intellectually stupefying.\n\nSimultaneously existing within and outside imputed markers and communities of race, gender, and sexuality, we trek on the path of our forefathers. We are called to speak with the urgency of Malcolm, the insight of Baldwin and the truth Essex. We must live with the fearlessness, strategic, acuity of Joseph Beam and Bayard Rustin; navigating the world with our eyes on holistic, comprehensive justice. We must create and we must love, with the fire and passion of Ru, Langston and Rotimi Fani-Kayode. From their shoulders and their pathways we are called and empowered to be all that we are; realizing and releasing the divine nature of our Blackness, Queerness & Flows of Survivance in honor of the crowns of our lineage, the proof of the present and the hope of our progeny. From transmisogyny to police violence, from femme-phobia to HIV criminalization, from poverty to sex-shaming, from heterosexisms to anti-black capitalism.. we are all we need to thrive. Indeed, we are all we've ever had.\"\n\n―\"A Love Letter To My BlaQueer Brothers,\" in Godless Circumcisions: A Recollecting & Remembering of Blackness, Queerness & Flows of Survivance.\n\nOur ancestors have done their work, gifting us with a bloody and loving legacy of overcoming and carrying-on, together.

      "text": "Black Men, We Need To Leave America\n\nCo-founder of Black & Abroad//Host of UNGENTRIFIED: The Podcast\n\nThis is not a piece about how foreign women will be docile and treat you like a king, sorry bro. This is about preservation of self. This is about saving your sanity. This is about living. You need to leave the United States for a couple of days (or weeks, or years), and you need to do it alone.\n\nLet's be honest, there are often times where you feel like a foreigner in your own home. No matter how accomplished you've become, your own country still looks at you like an anomaly, a glitch, an insult to the system designed to defeat me and you, your momma and your cousin too. As black men, we are constantly subjected to the idea of who we are, instead of our truths.\n\nAs lucky as I've been to travel the world pretty frequently, many would be surprised to learn my first international solo trip was this year. I've flown solo to destinations and met up with friends in different cities, but a trip where I was my only ally in another country hadn't happened just yet. Now that I've done it, I'm pissed I didn't take a solo journey earlier. I didn't know how badly I needed to be away. I didn't know how much I would gain from going alone. I didn't know until I came back. I needed a break from America.\n\nThe last few years have been a unique kind of purgatory for me as a black man, and I'm sure this is the truth for countless other black and brown men existing in America. Daily we are force fed examples of ourselves being taunted, harassed, and murdered, to the point where we too, experience a death of sorts. You slowly spiral downward, finding yourself in this twisted waiting room, counting the days until you become the hashtag. Every week you learn of a new way to die (playing your music loud, doing your job, asking for help when your car has stalled on the road, or reading a book in your car) with no new details on how to live. This dark space we're in right now, isn't living. This isn't supposed to be your black existence.\n\nBy this point, they've won. They've made you believe that this black hole of despair belongs to you. You've got to save yourself. It is because of this, that your next (or even your first) trip out of the country needs to be a solo trip. You, my friend, need a break. You need a moment away to recharge, reflect, and realign. You need to call out sick from America.\n\n\"And they say by 21 I was supposed to die, so I'm out here celebrating my post-demise.\" - Jay Z\n\nPower. @philwaukee is #blackandabroad at the Blue Lagoon in Grindavík, Iceland.

Traveling alone forces you to tap into these abilities and actually use skills you rarely get to flex when at home, such as being a social being and talking to strangers, accepting the challenge of critical thinking and problem solving to get where you want to go.\n\nMore importantly, it gives you the chance to be a carefree black man. Do things you wouldn't think of doing with your crew around because your boys might look at you funny. The only person you have to worry about making a fool of yourself in front of, is people you're likely to never see again, and if you do, they'll know you as that ridiculously confident guy who didn't care about what others thought. These are the kind of moments you need to realize that being you is the most lit thing you can do, a direct hit to the notion that being you is reason enough for death.\n\nThere's also the opportunities for these freeing moments of clarity that you just can't get while being surrounded by your normal atmosphere. Some of my best moments of reflection and healing (because yes, we as black men need space to heal from the litany of attacks upon our being) came from being away from all of the static of my day-to-day. You'd be surprised by how clear the mind becomes when it's away from home.\n\n\"When I discover who I am, I'll be free.\" - Ralph Ellison\n\nLife is short, make every moment count! #blackandabroad in St. Maarten, taking in the beauty of Maho Beach. #ExploreEmbraceEmpower\n\nA photo posted by Black & AbroadTM (@blackandabroad) on Aug 22, 2016 at 4:29am PDT\n\nBruh, just go. Stop waiting on your frat brothers to find the time off, stop waiting on someone to say your dream trip to Antartica is a dope idea, stop waiting for others to validate your decision to go somewhere. Just go. I've missed out on really great trips waiting for others to come to their senses. I decided that \"they,\" whoever \"they\" may be, won't prevent me from seeing the world. If I want to see the pyramids, I'm going, with or without you. Be your own man and see the world.\n\nBreak barriers for others by going it alone. Someone's solo trip is waiting on yours to inspire them. So do it.\n\nThe other great part to a solo trip is creating a part of your life that is closed off to your friends, family, and colleagues. We as black men often keep the things to ourselves that we need to share most; our pain, our cries for help. Very rarely do we get to make and maintain positive moments that are ours, and ours only. That's exactly what these kinds of trips are for.\n\n\"Men can starve from a lack of self-realization as much as they can from a lack of bread.\" - Richard Wright\n\nBe Courageous. @eatnow_eatlater is #blackandabroad at the Saut-d' Eau Waterfall in Haiti. #ExploreEmbraceEmpower #BlackTravel #BlackMenTravel #Melanin #Adventure #Haiti #Ayiti #SautDeau #Waterfall #FitFam #Nature #⚫️✈️\n\nA photo posted by Black & AbroadTM (@blackandabroad) on Jul 18, 2016 at 5:02am PDT\n\nYour current space in the world can kill you, in more ways than one.

Yet somehow, we still cling onto these westernized ideas as gospel. Remember, these same \"western\" ideals are often used as confirmation to view and treat you in a certain way. Taking a chance to see how other cultures view the world, experience life, and view manhood is key to understanding that most of what you thought you knew, was BS. Especially when it comes to how we as Americans view the safety of the rest of the world. I've had friends and family tell me, \"I want to travel, but the lack of safety in some of these countries concerns me...\" I can't subscribe to that way of thinking, especially when my safety in my own country is questionable at best. I challenge those concerned about their safety to really compare your fears of making it home without a police encounter to the \"safety\" concerns you have about visiting other countries. And honestly, most of the people telling you a place isn't safe, haven't been anywhere near the place in question. Ask somebody how safe they think Cuba is, and it's likely they won't tell you it's labeled one of the safest countries in Latin America, let alone the world. What they will tell you is \"Be safe,\" implying some notion that your life is more at risk there than where you currently are. You also can't rely upon online reviews from others to gauge how safe YOU will feel in another country. Because of our daily interactions as black men, our thresholds of fear, for better or worse, usually rest higher on the scale than others, since we live with a daily cloud of threat over our heads on our home turf.\n\n\"All we wanna do is be free.\" - J.

And because it's just you, it doesn't have to be this grand, luxurious getaway (unless that's your thing, then by all means...). The beauty of traveling alone, is that the only person you're accountable for, is you. If you're a morning person, you're not waiting for the rest of your crew to get up to enjoy a day in a new place. If you want to come back to the hotel in the middle of the day to catch a nap, do it.

I know what you're thinking, and no, this isn't selfish. You are not abandoning your community by taking time for you to rebuild.

      "text": "After Major Industry Donor Pops Up, Harris Makes Bizarre Proposal: Crypto for Black Men\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLosing Black voters to Donald Trump, the Harris campaign has an idea for helping Black men. But what does it mean?\n\nDays after a leading crypto industry figure endorsed her, Vice President Kamala Harris gave cryptocurrencies a vague embrace this week - as part of a pitch to Black men.\n\nAlong with a pledge to legalize weed, the policy document released by Harris's campaign Monday made a bid for Black men's votes with ambiguous wording about regulating crypto. The move left industry critics wondering whether she backs strong or weak safeguards at a time when the industry is pouring money into political races.\n\nWhile the crypto industry has spread its money around - spending more than $200 million on the congressional campaigns of friendly candidates from both parties - leading crypto figures have mostly backed former President Donald Trump. The preference is largely seen as a rebuke of the Biden administration's willingness to regulate the scandal-plagued sector.\n\nCrypto skeptics were divided on how to interpret Harris's comments, with one saying that they seemed to be aimed as much at donors as voters.\n\n\"What she is doing is reflecting the will of some of her funders,\" said Jared Ball, a professor of communication and Africana/Black studies at Morgan State University, \"which is to get some policy support to give engagement in crypto trading more legitimacy, which is just going to help fleece more people.\"\n\nSince entering the race in July, Harris has courted business leaders who took a dour view of the Biden administration thanks to its enforcement of antitrust and securities laws.\n\nThat cohort includes the Silicon Valley venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who announced their support for Trump days before Biden dropped out of the race. Their firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested billions of dollars in cryptocurrency, moves that coincided with scrutiny of crypto by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOnce a critic, Trump has turned into a crypto booster since launching his campaign. At a crypto conference in July, Trump said the industry's regulations would be \"written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\" More recently, he's been shilling a cryptocurrency of his own .\n\nHarris has been far more circumspect. Behind the scenes, however, she has engaged with industry insiders.\n\nIn an October 4 post on X , Horowitz, a longtime friend of Harris's, said he had had \"several conversations\" with Harris and her advisers. Saying he was \"encouraged\" by the discussions, Horowitz announced that he was making a large donation to the Harris campaign.\n\n\"As we stated earlier, the Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry, but especially as it relates to Crypto/Blockchain and AI,\" Horowitz said. \"So, while I am very hopeful that the Harris Administration will be much better, they have not yet stated their intentions.\"\n\nHarris had already made some encouraging comments about cryptocurrencies before Horowitz made his tweet. Within two weeks of their meeting coming to light, however, she rolled out her most direct statement on the issue in a policy paper on helping Black men.\n\nLosing ground among Black men to Trump in the polls, Harris has ramped up her direct appeals. Her nine-page \" Opportunity Agenda for Black Men \" included conventional-sounding ideas, such as $20,000 forgivable loans for entrepreneurs and expanded apprenticeship programs.\n\nThe most attention-grabbing sections, however, called for legalizing recreational marijuana and, finally, making it easier for Black men who own crypto \"to benefit from financial innovation.\"\n\nThe paper said that Harris \"will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSurveys suggest that Black Americans, wary or shut out of traditional financial institutions, have invested in cryptocurrencies at higher rates than other Americans . Critics say that has left Black people more vulnerable to fluctuations in the volatile crypto market.\n\nSince releasing the policy document, Harris has not elaborated on what sort of \"regulatory framework\" she would like to see. Rick Claypool, the research director for Public Citizen's president's office, said the statement was \"a bit of a Rorschach.\"\n\nThe industry has long said that it supports regulations, just weak ones enforced by the short-staffed Commodity Futures Trading Commission . Meanwhile, critics who liken the industry to a giant Ponzi scheme say that existing regulations enforced by the SEC are appropriate.\n\nMark Hays, a senior policy analyst with Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, said his \"overarching concern\" was that the industry would secure lax oversight under the guise of regulatory clarity: \"a wolf in sheep's clothing thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not comment on whether she supports regulation under the CFTC or the SEC.\n\nLeaving aside that question, Ball, the Morgan State professor, said his larger concern was the document's suggestion that \"Black capitalism\" could close the racial wealth gap.\n\n\"The specific role that crypto has played in this discussion has just been to refurbish those old claims and give them new packaging,\" Ball said.\n\nStill, at least one industry critic said he saw signs for hope in the Harris campaign document.\n\n\"I have written that no one should be in crypto,\" said Algernon Austin, the director for race and economic justice at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"But given that people are, definitely more regulation, more transparency, more safeguards would be an improvement.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The FBI Spends a Lot of Time Spying on Black Americans\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe FBI released a new trove of documents relating to its surveillance of black activists. They're mostly redacted.\n\nThe FBI has come under intense criticism after a 2017 leak exposed that its counterterrorism division had invented a new, unfounded domestic terrorism category it called \" black identity extremism .\" Since then, legislators have pressured the bureau's leadership to be more transparent about its investigation of black activists, and a number of civil rights groups have filed public records requests to try to better understand who exactly the FBI is investigating under that designation. Although the bureau has released hundreds of pages of documents, it continues to shield the vast majority of these records from public scrutiny.\n\nThe sheer volume of documents those surveillance efforts have produced is troublesome, advocates say. The latest batch of FBI documents - obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union and the racial justice group MediaJustice and shared with The Intercept - reveals that between 2015 and 2018, the FBI dedicated considerable time and resources to opening a series of \"assessments\" into the activities of individuals and groups it mostly labeled \"black separatist extremists.\" This designation was eventually folded into the category of \"black identity extremism.\" Earlier this year, following an onslaught of criticism from elected officials, civil liberties advocates, and even some law enforcement groups, the FBI claimed that it had abandoned the \"black identity extremism\" label, substituting it for a \"racially motivated violent extremism. \" Critics say that this designation conveniently obscures the fact that black supremacist violence, unlike white supremacist violence, does not actually exist.\n\nRelated As Black Activists Protested Police Killings, Homeland Security Worried They Might Join ISIS\n\nAlthough the FBI has frequently changed its labels and terminology, the surveillance of black Americans has continued. As The Intercept has reported, following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, the FBI began spying on Ferguson activists and tracking their movements across states, warning local law enforcement partners that Islamic State group supporters were \"urging\" protesters to join their ranks. The FBI also drafted a mysterious \" race paper ,\" the contents of which remain secret even though the bureau has disowned it. And as the Young Turks reported , the bureau has established a program dubbed \"Iron Fist\" targeting so-called black identity extremists with undercover agents.\n\nThe latest documents were turned over to the ACLU and MediaJustice after the groups sued the FBI last March over its failure to comply with a public records request. While the bureau is expected to release more documents in the coming months, what it has turned over so far is so heavily redacted that it is largely incomprehensible. In addition to removing entire paragraphs and all geographical and other identifiers from the documents, the FBI simply withheld hundreds of pages in full.\n\n\"These documents suggest that since at least 2016, the FBI was engaged in a national intelligence collection effort to manufacture a so-called 'Black Identity Extremist' threat,\" Nusrat Choudhury, deputy director of the ACLU Racial Justice Program, told The Intercept. \"They are spending a lot of energy on this and they are clearly reaching out to other law enforcement.\"\n\n\"We are troubled about the fact that so much information is not being made available to the public,\" she added. \"We just know that the government is likely redacting information that should be disclosed to the public - it frequently does.\"\n\nA bureau spokesperson wrote to The Intercept in a statement that \"every activity that the FBI conducts must uphold the Constitution and be carried out in accordance with federal laws.\"\n\n\"Investigative activity may not be based solely on the exercise of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment,\" the spokesperson added. \"The FBI's investigative methods are subject to multiple layers of oversight, and we ensure that our personnel are trained on privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\"\n\nMost of the newly released documents are investigative files that show the FBI has opened a number of what bureau guidelines refer to as \"assessments,\" primarily into the activities of individuals it calls \"black separatist extremists.\" Assessments differ from full-blown investigations - or \"predicated investigations,\" in the bureau's lingo - because they do not need to be predicated on a factual basis. That means the bureau needs no evidence of criminality or a national security threat in order to open an assessment. Assessments need only to be authorized for a specific purpose, such as recruiting new informants.\n\nAs a new report by the civil liberties group Defending Rights & Dissent notes, when choosing targets for an assessment, agents are allowed to use ethnicity, religion, or speech protected by the First Amendment as a factor, \"as long as it is not the only one.\" As the report notes, \"Even though the standards for opening an assessment are extraordinarily low, the FBI is allowed to use extremely intrusive investigative techniques in performing them, including physical surveillance, use of informants, and pretextual interviews.\"\n\nDuring pretextual interviews, FBI agents are not required to disclose their status as federal officials and can lie about the purpose of the interview in order to elicit incriminating statements. Agents can open an assessment without a supervisor's approval for a period of 30 days, after which a supervisor must sign off on an extension. After 90 days, an assessment must be reauthorized. Assessments can be reauthorized an unlimited number of times, which means that the FBI can surveil law-abiding citizens posing no national security threat for years.\n\nHeavily redacted FBI documents show the bureau opened a series of assessments to investigate black groups and individuals despite no evidence that they were committing crimes or posing a security threat.\n\nMany of the new documents obtained by the ACLU and MediaJustice suggest that the FBI repeatedly reauthorized assessments beyond their initial duration periods. Because of the heavy redactions, however, it is not clear whether the bureau has opened many different assessments or whether the same handful of assessments have been extended multiple times. While some of the assessments refer to a particular geographic \"area of responsibility,\" others do not include such a designation, suggesting that they may refer to nationwide assessments of certain groups or organizations.\n\nThe reauthorization requests released by the FBI include a series of questions about the objective of the assessment, whether it was fulfilled, and any investigative techniques deployed. Because the answers are fully redacted, however, it's impossible to tell whether the assessments had plausible justifications. It's also unclear whether any robust review led to each reauthorization or whether supervisors merely rubber-stamped extension requests, Choudhury said. \"Unfortunately they're just redacting the parts of these that would give us an objective check on how they're making decisions.\"\n\nIn addition to paperwork relating to its multiple assessments, the new documents include reports of \"liaisons\" with organizations outside of the FBI and electronic communications suggesting active FBI collaboration with other law enforcement agencies. The bureau's memos refer to a number of \"strategy meetings\" involving local law enforcement, including in the days before the first anniversary of Brown's killing in Ferguson, which reignited protests. In another exchange, law enforcement partners were asked to contribute to \"collecting better intelligence on possible Black Separatist Extremists.\"\n\nThe documents also refer to the FBI's work with \"Joint Terrorism Task Forces,\" which bring together agents with officers from hundreds of state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. Because JTTFs are run by the FBI, they operate under FBI guidelines, which provide fewer protections for speech, privacy, and civil liberties than the rules governing local police and other law enforcement.\n\nBut while federal and other law enforcement cooperation is routine, involving local police in vague and sweeping political surveillance efforts is deeply problematic, critics say. In fact, threat assessment reports such as the one on \"black identity extremism\" pose a particular challenge to local law enforcement, said Mike German, a former FBI agent and vocal critic of the bureau.\n\n\"What is it telling law enforcement officers to do?\" German told The Intercept. \"Most of [these assessments] just say, 'Be very afraid of this new threat,' and they don't give any practical advice for how to identify that threat, or how to distinguish that threat from legitimate protest, or nonviolent civil disobedience, or other First Amendment-protected activity that might promote some similar ideas, but isn't violence. So then the solution for these police departments that receive it is to treat all of them as if they are potential threats.\"\n\nTo activists already concerned with police violence and a lack of accountability, police collaboration with the FBI's surveillance efforts is particularly troubling.\n\n\"This is happening at the same time when jurisdictions across the country, our police departments, are actively acquiring surveillance tools in really secretive ways, without any sort of oversight and regulation,\" said Myaisha Hayes, an organizer with MediaJustice, in an interview. \"And it makes me worry that those tools can be used against activists given the sort of environment that the FBI is creating around criminalizing dissent.\"\n\nThroughout the documents, the FBI repeats boilerplate warnings that some \"indicators\" of domestic terrorism \"may constitute the exercise of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\" and reminds agents that \"the FBI is prohibited from engaging in investigative activity for the sole purpose of monitoring the exercise of First Amendment rights.\"\n\nEven so, the documents suggest that the bureau did in fact target protected speech as part of its surveillance activities, at some point monitoring the October 2015 \"Million Man March\" in Washington, D.C. While most of the memo concerning the march is redacted, the document does refer to the \"violent rhetoric and nature\" of the event - even though the march was in fact a nonviolent demonstration that drew tens of thousands to the capital to commemorate the original 1995 event and protest a series of high-profile police killings of black men.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile the FBI has a long history of targeting black Americans - most notably when it infiltrated and sought to disrupt the civil rights movement as part of its COINTELRPO political policing campaign - the bureau has in recent years shifted its target from those espousing \"separatist\" views to the much larger group of those protesting police violence. As The Intercept has reported , in an internal email exchange obtained by the government transparency group Property of the People, Michael F. Paul, an official with the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, wrote to colleagues that the bureau had updated its definition of \"black separatist extremism\" in order \"to broaden it beyond simply those seeking 'separatism.'\" Paul added: \"The threat or movement has simply evolved, and many are seeking more than/other than separation.\"\n\nIn fact, what those in the targeted \"movement\" say they are seeking is simply an end to police violence, as well as greater justice and government accountability.\n\n\"The Black Lives Matter movement, black-led organizations that are focused around policing and police brutality have not had a single incident of violence associated with their activist work,\" Hayes told The Intercept. \"That tells me that what the FBI is looking for is opportunities to basically disrupt organizing that challenges and threatens the status quo.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Before He Was UVA Police Chief, Timothy Longo Helmed DNA Dragnet That Targeted Black Men\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA closer examination of a two-decade-old operation in Charlottesville, Virginia, shows that it was larger in scope than previously reported.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, long before Charlottesville made national news for a far-right rally in 2017, and years before the peak of stop-and-frisk in New York and other cities, the Virginia city implemented a \"DNA dragnet\" that swept up nearly 200 Black men.\n\nAfter a serial rapist, who first struck in 1997, brutally assaulted a victim in November 2002, Charlottesville police became increasingly desperate to catch the suspect. They had his DNA but were short on leads, and physical descriptions given by victims varied; they knew only that he was a Black man. So, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo authorized a policy whereby officers could approach Black men that they felt matched the extremely broad description and request DNA samples. Over the next two years, the names of targets were kept in a running master suspect list maintained by the department.\n\nIn April 2004, the dragnet was halted after press coverage joined with community outcry over allegations of racial profiling and police harassment. The dragnet never identified the serial rapist - who was instead apprehended after being recognized in public by a victim in 2007 - and the city pledged to narrow its focus. Longo remained as Charlottesville police chief and served until 2016.\n\nAn independent review of the dragnet by The Intercept reveals that it was larger in scope than previously reported. According to interviews of current and former local officials and internal records previously filed in court by the Charlottesville Police Department and obtained by The Intercept, the Albemarle County Police Department and the University Police Department at the University of Virginia collected buccal, or cheek, swabs alongside CPD, with UPD even sharing students' personal information in the process.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn an email to The Intercept, ACPD spokesperson Abbey Stumpf denied that the department was involved in the dragnet, though she acknowledged that buccal swabs \"could have been consensually obtained\" by ACPD and that \"ACPD collected DNA samples during the course of investigations and compared them to the database if there was a similar MO to other cases.\" UVA did not respond to questions about UPD's role in the dragnet.\n\nNotably, CPD records contradict Longo's previous suggestions that the swabbing of Black men was tightly controlled. As Longo told the Washington Post, \"There's this picture out there that hundreds of people have had a Q-tip stuck in their mouths, and that ain't it.\" In one case, CPD records show that a man had been approached on two separate occasions for a swab, only for police to later note that he \"does not fit the general description of the suspect. He appears to weigh at least 250 pounds with [sic] very round face and abdomen.\" The Intercept's reporting also sheds light on the limited recourse the legal system can offer for victims of alleged racial discrimination, as local resident Larry Monroe discovered after suing the city for being targeted in the dragnet. (Documents from his lawsuit provided the foundation for The Intercept's reporting.)\n\nThe dragnet remains infamous among longtime residents of Charlottesville, a city with a history of racially biased policing as well as current issues of segregation and racially disproportionate stop-and-frisks . In 2018, Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker sharply criticized Longo when asked for her reaction to Virginia adding new categories of mandatory DNA registration for criminal convictions. Walker replied that the basis of the law is racist, pointing to Charlottesville's dark history of DNA collection. \"Charlottesville is the locality that helped fuel that,\" she said. \"The chief of police at the time, Chief Longo, thought that it was OK to round Black men up and take their DNA samples to see if they had been the individuals who had committed a crime.\"\n\nMany community members were concerned when the University of Virginia announced on February 13, 2020 that Longo had been formally appointed to lead its public safety services. \"I was very surprised that Longo surfaced as the chief of the University Police Department,\" M. Rick Turner, UVA's former dean of African-American affairs, told The Intercept.\n\nIn response to a detailed list of questions about Longo's hiring process and whether the university evaluated concerns related to these events and others, UVA spokesperson Brian Coy confirmed that the university examined Longo's record, writing, \"[Longo's] service in the Charlottesville/Albemarle area and his commitment to building positive relationships with the community made him the right candidate for the post.\"\n\nCoy also referenced the recent upheaval over policing in America, stating that Longo was the right person to guide the university through it. \"There are many valid viewpoints and concerns about the proper role of policing [in] our society and we have a responsibility to ensure that our approach is responsive to the needs of our community,\" Coy wrote. \"That is a key part of the reason the University hired Tim Longo as the Associate Vice President of Safety and Security and Chief of Police. Throughout his career, Chief Longo has demonstrated the leadership and personal character necessary to keep our community safe in a way that reflects the University's core values of justice and equality.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Longo wrote, \"As our efforts to collect DNA samples were underway, I heard from many members of the Black community in this area that the policy was overinclusive and ineffective. Through these conversations, I recognized that the policy impacted our relationship with that community in a negative way and took steps to correct our initial mistake.\" Longo added, \"I regret allowing it to take place as it did - it was wrong, and I am sorry. Since then, I have tried my best to listen and I have tried hard to rebuild relationships and to restore trust where it may have been lost.\"\n\nThe old guard of law enforcement still has sway in Charlottesville and particularly at UVA, a behemoth institution that looms large over local issues. \"Longo is popular with white people in the community as a police officer,\" Turner told The Intercept, adding that \"Black students and Black alumni should be alarmed that a police chief from the ranks of Charlottesville is now elevated\" at UVA.\n\nA man walks the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. on March 20, 2015.\n\nWhen news broke of the DNA dragnet, which was first reported by the local outlet The Hook in July 2003 and nearly a year later by national outlets like the Washington Post, the program was swiftly condemned by the community. Over the course of the dragnet, according to internal records later filed in court by CPD that have not previously been reported, police swabbed 197 men. CPD meticulously tracked every swab collected, with each assigned an individual custody record, and kept note of those who refused to be swabbed. At the time, Longo rebuked allegations of racial profiling, stressing that \"We weren't approaching and accosting Black men on the street.\"\n\nThe Intercept reviewed 30 cases in which individuals refused a swab, and CPD internal records from these stops tell a different story. The documents demonstrate that police often exerted minimal effort to narrowly target suspects and frequently accosted Black men on the street, contrary to Longo's claims. In some cases, police attempted to swab men who they later found out were already in the state's DNA database or would soon be added for separate criminal offenses; in others, men who were approached for a swab were later ruled out for not fitting the description. Some attempted swabs even came from traffic stops. Others were approached for a swab only for Charlottesville police to subsequently discover that they were in jail the day of an assault by the serial rapist.\n\nPolice stressed that all swabs were obtained on a voluntary basis. But many residents expressed that they did not feel they had much of a choice, considering several were approached at home or their places of work. CPD records also reveal several instances in which officers would repeatedly press those who refused requests for swabs on separate occasions. \"Approached again,\" one form notes, subsequently reading, \"again declined.\" According to CPD court filings, of the 30 men who initially refused to be swabbed, nine would later relent.\n\nThese internal records also raise questions about the nature of the stops CPD conducted to obtain swabs. After one resident refused a swab, a form reads that he was stopped by police once again and \"arrested for [Drunk in Public],\" noting, \"DNA sample obtained.\"\n\nOne resident arrived at the police department furious after having been asked for a swab, asserting, \"I'm not the fucking rapist.\" But Charlottesville police did not seem too concerned, since \"He really looked like too much of a 'crackhead' to be the rapist.\" After another man refused a request for a swab, an officer noted that \"He is well spoken.\" A composite sketch released by Charlottesville police claimed that the serial rapist had \"unnaturally white\" or \"slightly bulging eyes.\" This description was apparently enough to motivate one officer out on patrol to stop a man on the street and later write in a field contact card, \"Suspect kept looking back as I went by,\" adding, \"Person [sic] eyes look big!\" The man refused a swab, though he relented after being approached again.\n\nOne former Charlottesville police officer, Curtis Brandon, told The Intercept that the dragnet became a source of anxiety for many Black men in Charlottesville. \"I feel like if I wasn't an officer and I was outside jogging,\" Brandon said, \"they probably would have stopped me.\"\n\nCharlottesville police were also given greater leeway to swab suspects than previously known. Though previous press reports discuss that a multi-jurisdictional team was established to identify the serial rapist, the widespread involvement of CPD officers outside this task force, as well as those of other departments, in swabbing residents has not been reported. Over 40 CPD officers, including patrol officers, collected swabs at different points during the dragnet, an analysis of buccal swab custody records shows.\n\nDave Chapman, the commonwealth's attorney for Charlottesville at the time of the dragnet, told The Intercept, \"When you see the apparent involvement of patrol-level officers in actually making contacts and collecting samples, that's a danger signal,\" reasoning that \"the methodology, the strategy that's being followed isn't adequately well-supervised.\" Concerning the nature of the stops, he said, \"It is well-known and it's true to this very day that when an officer is approaching a citizen, there is a different power dynamic. It's not equal. That's a reality.\"\n\nWhereas previous reporting of the dragnet centered on Charlottesville police, records reveal that University and Albemarle County police officers swabbed residents as well. According to a list of all swabs compiled by CPD and reviewed by The Intercept, CPD swabbed 167 men, UPD swabbed 21, and ACPD swabbed nine, bringing the total number of men stopped in the dragnet to at least 218, since 21 of the 30 men who initially refused never ended up providing a swab. (Longo previously told the Washington Post in April 2004 that 197 men had been stopped in the dragnet and 10 refused a swab.)\n\nSteven Turner, a student at University of Virginia, talks to a group on April 12, 2004 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. Turner was stopped twice by the Charlottesville Police Department and asked to submit a DNA sample.\n\nUniversity and Charlottesville police closely coordinated to surveil and swab Black men, particularly after attacks near UVA's campus prompted officers to patrol the area. \"Uva obtained Gatorade bottle and submitted to lab,\" a CPD officer noted. \"We will continue to attempt swabs.\" Sometimes CPD referred an individual to UPD after trying and failing to obtain a swab. Other times CPD notified UPD to swab residents who would travel through UPD's jurisdiction. In many cases, UPD would share information with CPD to target men for swabs.\n\nUPD also divulged UVA students' personal information to other departments in the process. After one man refused a swab, CPD noted that UPD \"advised subject is a student and should be returning in AUG [sic] to begin his 4th year.\" UPD also \"reported that he did not live at [address redacted], according to their records.\" The student, who had previously refused, evidently later complied with another request for a swab, since CPD remarked \"DNA sample obtained.\" (If this student was a fourth-year undergraduate as the document suggests, this particular stop also speaks to a lack of narrow criteria, since the serial rapist had first struck in 1997, likely before the student would have arrived in Charlottesville.)\n\nTurner, the former UVA dean, told The Intercept that close to a dozen students approached him about being targeted by the police for a swab. Turner and other community leaders spoke out, eventually prompting a meeting in April 2004 on UVA's campus where the tactics of the dragnet were denounced. Within days, Longo agreed to scale the dragnet back, bringing it to a halt.\n\nDuring the dragnet's operation, a university commission formed by former university President John T. Casteen was studying how to improve diversity and equity, but a UVA official with direct knowledge of the commission's deliberations told The Intercept that its members had no formal discussion regarding the dragnet at all. Although Turner told The Intercept that he was aware UPD participated in the dragnet, other senior university officials offered little insight into their knowledge of the dragnet or UPD's role. Casteen wrote to The Intercept, \"Sad to tell, I do not remember the dragnet in which you are interested.\"\n\nIt is unclear how widely known UPD's involvement was with the department's own officers. Michael Coleman, who served as a captain with UPD during the time of the dragnet, told The Intercept, \"The University Police Department, to the best of my knowledge, did not participate in that\" since \"it alienated or aggravated a fair amount of the Charlottesville population.\"\n\nBlake Caravati, who served on the Charlottesville City Council between 1998 to 2006, acknowledged in an interview with The Intercept that the dragnet \"was certainly racial profiling\" and \"not a good decision at the time,\" though he offered high praise for Longo. \"You can't cancel the guy because he's one of the best police chiefs in the country at the time,\" he said, echoing many of Longo's peers who lauded his leadership. \"We're all fallible, right?\"\n\nDetective Sgt. James Mooney, left, stands next to Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo, right, during a news conference on Sept. 19, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nA single lawsuit was filed in response to the dragnet. After Charlottesville resident Larry Monroe was swabbed in March 2004, he sued CPD, Longo, and CPD detective James Mooney the following July.\n\nMonroe's litigation spanned several years as it made its way through state and federal courts, eventually culminating in an attempted federal class-action lawsuit that fell apart following unfavorable court rulings. Despite Monroe's apparent lack of any shared physical characteristics with the serial rapist besides being Black, and CPD's aggressive tactics of stopping a wide range of Black men under circumstances criticized by residents, state and federal courts dismissed Monroe's claims.\n\nMonroe died in 2018. Mooney, now assistant chief of CPD, told The Intercept that he knew Monroe personally before swabbing him. He said, \"I never would have thought in my wildest dreams\" that Monroe could be the serial rapist. Concerning the lawsuit, he added, \"I think Monroe was a decent guy, I think he was a decent father, and I don't think he deserved to go through that.\"\n\nLike many men approached for DNA samples, Monroe was asked for a swab at his home, though mere days before, he had been in police custody following an arrest for misdemeanor disorderly conduct. (Monroe's attorney later told a court that he was exonerated of the charge.) According to Monroe's March 2004 misdemeanor arrest record, Charlottesville police recorded his height as 5-foot-8 and weight as 290 pounds, well outside the range of descriptions of the serial rapist.\n\nMonroe later testified that he was nervous and scared and did not want to provide a swab, but complied because \"[Mooney]'s the police,\" adding that he did not feel he had a choice. \"I just feel it's messed up,\" Monroe said. \"I don't fit the description, but just because I'm a Black man, I feel like I'm being pinpointed.\"\n\nMonroe's trial commenced on January 31, 2005 in Virginia state court, where proceedings revealed that Monroe was targeted for a swab because CPD Officer William Sclafani had stopped him on the night of May 31, 2003. According to a field contact card Sclafani wrote after the encounter, Monroe \"was out at Chancellor St with four black males\" and told Sclafani that he was \"looking for a party.\" Since the area was dominated by student housing left mostly vacant for the summer, Sclafani reasoned that Monroe \"may have been scoping out houses.\" This fact, combined with the apparent note that Monroe was on ACPD's \"list\" as well, was sufficient to designate Monroe for a swab nearly a year after Sclafani's stop occurred.\n\n\"He came to their attention because he was Black in public,\" Monroe's attorney, Deborah Wyatt, told The Intercept. \"The college kids had left, said Sclafani, so he might have been casing the place. It was racist from the inception.\"\n\nMooney told the court that Monroe had signed a consent form, which the department claimed was standard for all swabs, but Monroe testified that he did not recall signing one. In any event, the swabs and consent forms had been destroyed after the department pledged in April 2004 to eliminate all samples that were ruled out.\n\nMonroe lost the case and filed an appeal in state court. He then decided to nonsuit the lawsuit - drop with a chance to refile - and filed a new case in federal court in the Western District of Virginia, claiming he was racially profiled.\n\nMonroe was also seeking class-action certification, meaning that more Black men who felt wrongly targeted by the dragnet could potentially join the lawsuit if the certification was approved. Wyatt told The Intercept that probably close to a dozen dragnet victims had expressed interest in suing, and one, Granville Boggs, told The Hook that he had separately contacted Wyatt about suing in the fall of 2003 and explicitly indicated that he was interested in joining a class-action suit. (Boggs could not be reached for comment. The Intercept unsuccessfully attempted to contact other victims of the dragnet, but many could not be reached because they had died, their identities were never publicly disclosed besides those who spoke with reporters, they have moved away from Charlottesville, or they were still wary of speaking to the press.)\n\nIn 2007, attorneys for the city moved to dismiss Monroe's claims as well as his class-action certification. At a subsequent hearing on the certification issue, Monroe's attorneys told The Intercept that they were troubled by an affidavit submitted by Sclafani, whose 2003 field contact card led to Monroe being swabbed.\n\nSclafani alleged that while on patrol, he encountered Monroe on the Charlottesville Downtown Mall. According to Sclafani, Monroe told him that the federal lawsuit had been filed in his name without his knowledge, that he was not interested in pursuing claims against Mooney, and that the lawsuit was making him \"look bad\" and he \"does not know what is going on.\"\n\n\"My recollection is we were surprised\" by the affidavit, remarked Neal Walters, who represented Monroe with Wyatt for the federal lawsuit, in an interview with The Intercept. \"I remember being in that courtroom and having the feeling afterwards of 'holy four-letter word, how do we deal with that?'\" Wyatt did not hesitate to characterize the affidavit, which contradicts Monroe's deposition, as false. \"It's not true,\" she told The Intercept. Both lawyers acknowledged that since the affidavit was filed with the court system, it could have escaped their notice before the hearing, catching them off guard. \"Sometimes we can both drop the ball,\" Wyatt said.\n\nReached for comment by phone, Sclafani confirmed submitting the affidavit but did not answer any other questions.\n\nJohn Raphling, a senior researcher on criminal justice at Human Rights Watch, told The Intercept that, generally speaking, the testimony of police officers is infrequently challenged by courts. \"Police officers are given an incredible amount of deference, to the point where judges often accept their word at face value and don't interrogate whether what they are saying is truthful,\" Raphling said. \"Police are not judged by the same standard as everybody else is.\"\n\nJudge Norman K. Moon dismissed most of Monroe's lawsuit and denied his class-action certification, relying heavily on Sclafani's affidavit in the process. \"I am convinced that ... a reasonable person would have felt free to decline Mooney's requests or to otherwise terminate the encounter,\" Moon wrote, acknowledging Monroe's claims of fraught relations between police officers and the Black community but ultimately disregarding them. An attempt to appeal also failed, citing precedents that grant wide latitude to law enforcement activities influenced by racial criteria.\n\nThe appeal decision in Monroe v. City of Charlottesville has since served as legal precedent in other cases involving allegations of racially discriminatory policing. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson in North Carolina for conducting what federal attorneys alleged was an \"egregious pattern of racial profiling.\" In 2015, a federal judge cited precedents like the Monroe decision and ruled in favor of Johnson.\n\nIn his remaining years as chief, Longo worked to repair the damage the dragnet created and helped implement new initiatives such as crisis intervention training for officers, which he also participated in. Longo also cooperated with efforts to improve local criminal justice outcomes. \"As a participant in community collaborations that have been undertaken to make our criminal justice system and our community better, I think he's been a very important player,\" James Hingeley, Albemarle's progressive commonwealth's attorney, told The Intercept.\n\nA leading example began in 2010, when law enforcement and other community representatives in the Charlottesville area embarked on a pilot program of the National Institute of Corrections called Evidence-Based Decision Making, in which officials like Longo played an important role. Throughout his career as chief, Longo's hands-on approach and close relations with community members were praised by many local leaders, who pointed to efforts like greater collaboration with churches, schools, youth programs, and human services.\n\nHowever, other events during Longo's tenure strained CPD's relationship with the community. After Sage Smith, a Black transgender woman, vanished in 2012, Charlottesville police mounted a lackluster response . Smith has never been found, though CPD is still investigating . Don Gathers, a community leader who was forced to suspend his run for City Council in large part due to white supremacist threats against his life, told The Intercept, \"When young Black children would come up missing, the same efforts didn't seem to be put forth, and that's still very much a point of contention in the Black community,\" emphasizing that \"Sage Smith is still missing.\"\n\nLongo had risen through the ranks of the Baltimore Police Department before becoming chief in Charlottesville, and after the death of Freddie Gray fueled intensifying Black Lives Matter protests, he sat down with the local news outlet C-VILLE Weekly in May 2015 to discuss a range of recent controversies. He said that events like those in Ferguson and Baltimore underscore \"that race relations are a significant part of our history and they continue to influence relationships we have today\" and noted specifically concerning the Gray case, \"I don't know about the investigation except for what I've read in the newspaper. I haven't talked to anyone from Baltimore about it.\"\n\nBaltimore police Officer William G. Porter arrives for trial at the Baltimore City Circuit Courthouse East, on Dec. 16, 2015 in Baltimore, Md.\n\nSeven months later, in December 2015, Longo gave expert testimony on behalf of Officer William Porter, who was indicted for his role in Gray's death in police custody. Longo reportedly told the jury that \"I believe [Porter's] actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances he was confronted with.\" The jury deadlocked and prosecutors later dropped all charges in the Gray case.\n\nLongo announced his retirement as CPD chief in November 2015 and was then recruited by UVA to lead a master's program in public safety that was slated to launch in 2019. In 2017, he started teaching a short course at UVA's law school called \"Understanding Police Use of Force: Investigation & Litigation Concepts,\" which he has taught for several semesters since.\n\nLongo's February 2020 appointment as UVA's security chief effectively consolidated all public safety administration at the university under his purview - reversing the creation of separate positions for chief of police and associate vice president for safety and security that stemmed from new security recommendations that followed the 2017 white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally - and occurred shortly before a national reckoning over police violence and racial discrimination.\n\nIn July 2020, UVA's Student Council passed a resolution demanding that the University Police Department's budget be decreased and its funds reallocated to the university's Counseling and Psychological Services. In an interview discussing the Student Council's vote, Longo pointed to a pin he wore signaling UPD's commitment to \"peace and justice,\" emphasizing that \"our job is to prove that they're more than just symbols, through our actions.\"\n\nMany students have since spoken out against the university, with some claiming that they have felt targeted by UVA for their protests. When fourth-year student Hira Azher, a resident of UVA's historic Lawn, posted a sign on the door of her residence denouncing UVA in September 2020, a UPD officer visited her room hours later in response to someone being \"offended.\"\n\nOther Lawn room residents posted similar signs in solidarity and were then subjected to constant threats and harassment by community members. Azher and another Lawn resident, Hannah Hiscott, told The Intercept that their property and that of other students was repeatedly vandalized, people would bang on and throw things at their doors throughout the night, strangers spied on them, and nothing was done to stop it. \"I don't feel safe at all here,\" Hiscott said.\n\nAfter being inundated with alumni complaints about Azher's sign, UVA President James Ryan responded with a post deriding it as \"offensive\" and \"deeply disappointing,\" which was followed by the university unveiling new regulations limiting Lawn residents' ability to post signs on their doors.\n\nThis past February, UPD announced the appointment of its first manager of diversity, equity, and inclusion, but some student activists say recent changes do not go far enough. Longo's appointment as chief was a \"slap in the face\" to the community, said Sarandon Elliott, a member of the student activist organization UVA Beyond Policing, in an interview with The Intercept.  Hiring a diversity, equity, and inclusion officer \"doesn't improve policing,\" Elliott added, remarking that it instead funnels \"more money into this violent institution.\" Citing Longo's record, including the DNA dragnet, UVA Beyond Policing is calling for his removal.\n\nAs UVA's police chief, Longo will have to continue to confront the lasting impact of the dragnet. Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney wrote to The Intercept that she would \"absolutely not\" consider a similar policy of DNA collection and that \"the legacy of the program continues to impact CPD's relationship with the Black community, particularly Black men.\" She noted that repercussions of programs like the dragnet are \"not confined to Charlottesville,\" since \"the cumulative effects associated with these types of practice[s] undermine the legitimacy of policing agencies across the nation.\"\n\nAnd though considerable time has passed, the dragnet remains a painful memory for longtime local residents like Raymond Mason, who described it as an \"all-time low\" for Charlottesville. \"Those were trying times because everybody was afraid, Black men were afraid that they were gonna get pulled over, roughed up, or whatever,\" Mason told The Intercept. \"Anybody was subject to be stopped and harassed. Anyone.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Not Just \"Cops\": It's Time to End the Entertainment Industry's Anti-Black, Pro-Police Programming\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe culture industry has consolidated the power of corrupt policing. We need a root-and-branch transformation of entertainment itself.\n\nStill from TV series, \"Cops,\" 1989.\n\n\"Cops,\" the longest-running reality TV show in U.S. history, was recently canceled after more than 30 years on air. You'd be hard-pressed to find a TV viewer who couldn't sing along to the show's signature tune, \"Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?\" Having been nominated for an Emmy four times, \"Cops\" even spawned a trail of ubiquitous knockoffs, including \"LAPD: Life on the Beat,\" \"Police POV,\" and \"Live PD.\"\n\nThe Paramount Network announced its decision to pull the plug on the seminal reality show after protests over George Floyd's death and police brutality. The cancellation is barely a first step, however. The entertainment industry has an insidious though unmistakable influence over how the public thinks about policing. It is necessary for people to understand how long and how thoroughly \"Cops\" and shows like it have habituated tens of millions of people to the police abuse of black, brown, and poor communities. Increasingly comfy in this sewer of misrepresentation, legions of viewers were numbed to the need for overdue reform.\n\nTo enjoy \"Cops\" is to relish seeing black, Latinx, and poor men harangued, choked, slammed, shot at, and handcuffed by police officers, with no meaningful context or resolution to any given human being's situation, whether it be mental illness, substance addiction, or wrongful accusation. Weekly footage exhilarated viewers through jerky bodycams capturing men of color getting snared and engrossed them with narrative idolatry lavished on white cops. All of this reflected and abetted structural flaws in law enforcement, as well as racial and class bias in the criminal justice system.\n\nHere lies a kind of gross misdemeanor. Defund the Police and Campaign Zero - two progressive, nonpartisan efforts to overhaul policing - have no parallel in entertainment. But the culture industry should be held accountable for helping consolidate the power of corrupt policing.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe popularity of \"Cops\" soared after its 1989 debut, alongside the documented evidence of its racism. A 2004 academic study in the Internet Journal of Criminology, for example, analyzed 16 episodes of \"Cops,\" examining the race and gender of the protagonists and antagonists, as well as each show's depiction of crime. The study found that black men were largely shown as criminal perpetrators - usually of violent crimes - and that Latino men also were typically depicted as violent criminals. The police officers appearing were overwhelmingly white, and the disproportionately few white offenders portrayed were often shown committing nonviolent offenses. Subsequent studies showed that \"Cops\" leads white viewers to believe that crime is more prevalent than it actually is; that black people commit more crime than they actually do; that the public is more likely to be victimized than they actually are; and that police \"intuitions\" and biases are better at helping to catch perpetrators than they actually are. As one of the most iconic reality shows in television history, \"Cops\" served for three decades as a shadow advertising campaign for racist and brutal policing.\n\nThis demonstrates why entertainment activism is just as necessary and worthwhile as policy activism. The culture industry, hand in glove with the state, has for decades mobilized to surveil, assault, and cage black and brown people. The country gorged itself on brutal, racially charged reality TV as it turned its eyes from mounting evidence of police brutality in real life. Yet entertainment activism is demonstrably different than police reform, because policing is presumably a public service supposedly accountable to democracy, whereas Hollywood is a business accountable mostly to the bottom line. How do people of color confront a capitalist enterprise that, like physical white spaces, is seething with our presence?\n\nChallenging the entertainment industry means making its leaders and general audiences aware of dangerous portrayals of policing that come at the expense of people of color. An ecosystem of artists, activists, and allied industry insiders - especially producers, directors, actors, agents, and writers - needs to be enlisted to push back against industry leaders as they make development and production decisions. This activist network would collaborate with producers and writers to offer script consultations and to advocate for fair and accurate content.\n\nAlso, this country needs to establish a rapid-response group to monitor film, television, music, streaming, and other media for their portrayals of anti-black policing. Enhancing the media-advocacy tactics innovated by Jewish and LGBTQ communities, this group would advocate for inclusive and humane portrayals of people of color being policed. When content runs that is pro-police brutality, classist, or anti-black, this new body would denounce the content strategically and loudly to audiences and to the industry, outlining why these harmful messages have no value in entertainment and how those messages damage actual communities and lives.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nAs well, advertisers contributing to this abusive entertainment should be identified and targeted for boycott. Companies should be encouraged to withdraw their ad dollars from shows that feature this content, not unlike the companies withdrawing their marketing buys from Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News . It's important to hold accountable both the advertiser and the entertainment vehicle.\n\nIn addition to these important reactive strategies, we can also proactively work to transform the cultural landscape to deliver impressive entertainment experiences that can catalyze mass audiences for social change. An example of how much can be accomplished in this regard is the film adaptation of Angie Thomas's bestselling book, \"The Hate U Give.\" Both feature the adventures of Starr Carter, a black 16-year-old girl who responds to police violence \"by any means necessary.\" The critically acclaimed film grossed $35 million against its $23 million budget.\n\nMany white people, judging from their massive turnout at protests, seem to finally understand that racist policing portrayed in so-called entertainment, rarely named as such, has its parallel in actual events. So many white politicians had scratched their heads in confusion, wondering whether all that amateur video of the Alton Sterlings and the Philando Castiles and the Eric Garners was really a thing. Weren't those black people overreacting, griping, in fact, about being targeted and killed by police? Later, the length and the graphic clarity and the poignancy of George Floyd gasping for his life under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin was the footage that somehow convinced the white masses that really it is a thing. Many white people have now come to accept this footage, perhaps the more telling form of reality programming. Put bluntly, are white people recognizing their decades-long complicity in aggressive policing by way of amateur footage that is more urgent and more convincing than \"Cops\"?\n\nJudging from recent news coverage, you'd think that the police are an extraterrestrial organization descending on our cities. Outfitted in their camouflage, semiautomatic rifles, grenade launchers, night-vision sniper scopes, and tactical armored vehicles, the police appear like a science-fictive force with paranormal capacity to parachute into civil disobedience and inflict damage, like in a war zone.\n\nIn fact, the police are no such thing. They are a mundane reflection of society - of the constituencies they protect.\n\nThough de jure segregation, as codified by law, no longer exists, de facto segregation remains. Police enforce segregation. Police guard private property. Police normalize racial and economic divisions. Police perform those roles so that white and upper-income and property-owning Americans don't have to. Police serve, in effect, as a kind of communal border patrol. Once the George Floyd protests erupted, and paramilitarized police struck back against protesters and journalists with brute force, much of the public expressed shock and indignation. The communities historically policed this way - black, brown, low-income - harbored no such surprise. That is because the police's reaction to the protests was an escalated, better-equipped iteration of traditional policing, especially as witnessed in our living rooms through entertainment vehicles like \"Cops.\"\n\nAll those public policy reforms being considered at the local and federal levels - enhancing training, diversifying forces, implementing \"community policing,\" requiring body cams, and instituting accountability measures - might do only so much. Consumers of mass entertainment need to be shown a forward-looking reality different from the unreality they previously devoured. What is needed, to augment policing and law enforcement reform, is a root-and-branch transformation of entertainment itself.\n\nThis article was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Fear of a Black Homeland\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Strange Tale of the FBI's Fictional \"Black Identity Extremism\" Movement\n\nH ours after police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on a quiet suburban street in Ferguson, Missouri, Olajuwon Ali Davis stood with a few dozen people on that same street. As the impromptu candlelight vigil that August night in 2014 turned into a historic wave of nationwide protests against police violence, Davis, wearing a black Malcolm X T-shirt, was among the first to lift his hands in surrender, as Brown was rumored to have been doing when Wilson shot him.\n\nWithin days, the gesture became the symbol of a movement for police accountability and racial justice the nation had not seen since the civil rights era. And the refrain protesters began chanting that night - \"Hands up, don't shoot\" - would soon be replaced by one that would echo across the country for years to come: Black lives matter.\n\nDavis, who was 22 at the time, kept showing up as the protests grew larger and angrier, and as scores of law enforcement descended on Ferguson wearing riot gear and firing tear gas. Days after Brown's death, during a short-lived break in the looting and police violence, Davis was photographed wearing all black and directing traffic; the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which he had joined on the heels of Brown's killing, was keeping the peace .\n\nDays later, Davis emailed a local reporter who had covered the NBPP's peacekeeping efforts to thank him for portraying \" the true nature and the intent \" of the party, which, despite taking its name, is not affiliated with the Black Panther Party of the 1960s. \"For the record we the NBPP and its local chapter members have and never [sic] promoted acts of violence towards anyone or any establishment or businesses,\" Davis wrote to the Riverfront Times , a St. Louis weekly. \"True enough there are people so angry that they show their pain and emotions with aggression towards cops and frankly anything that they can get their hands on. But let these few not distort the genuine peaceful intention and benevolence of the NBPP.\"\n\nThree months later, Davis and another young man named Brandon Orlando Baldwin were arrested in an FBI sting and accused of planning to plant bombs, kill officials connected to the Brown case, and blow up St. Louis's iconic Gateway Arch.

Although Davis and Baldwin were not charged under anti-terrorism laws, they do appear to be the first individuals retroactively labeled by the FBI as \"black identity extremists.\"\n\nThe FBI report was written six months into the Trump administration - as white supremacist groups felt emboldened by support for their ideology seemingly coming from the very top of the government - and was released only a week before the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white nationalist ran down and killed Heather Heyer. When the report was leaked to Foreign Policy later in 2017, it prompted fierce and widespread criticism from activists , civil rights advocates , and lawmakers , many of whom accused the FBI of reverting to the surveillance and sabotage of black activists that had defined its activities in the civil rights era.\n\nCritics called the report's contents \" fiction ,\" \" fantasy ,\" \"weak\" and \"irresponsible.\" Several noted that it seemed designed to distract attention from the reality of police abuse against minorities. \"The feds have invented a title - BIE - and linked it to a handful of episodes of violence,\" wrote Andrew Cohen , a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. \"To deflect legitimate criticism of police tactics, to undermine a legitimate protest movement that has emerged in the past three years to protest police brutality, the FBI has tarred the dissenters as domestic terrorists, an organized group with a criminal ideology that are a threat to police officers.\" \"Whenever you create an assumption that somebody poses a physical threat to law enforcement, that provides incentive for law enforcement to shoot first and ask questions later.\" The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, which includes leaders of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, called for the classification to be eliminated. \"This assessment resurrects the historically negative legacy of African American civil rights leaders who were unconstitutionally targeted and attacked by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies for seeking full U.S. citizenship under the law,\" the group wrote in a statement .\n\nYet even more worrisome than the report's political implications is the immediate threat to life that labeling someone a \"terrorist\" can pose, especially as the FBI has no way to monitor what law enforcement departments do with the reports it distributes. For many black people, already accustomed to being uniquely vulnerable to police violence, the fear is that being viewed as potential terrorists for expressing legitimate political grievances might give police license to target them even more intensely than they already do.\n\n\"Not only can they go after these people with surveillance, but they can then justify using the most aggressive, violent tactics,\" said Justin Hansford, a St. Louis activist and law professor who heads the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University. \"Whenever you create an assumption that somebody poses a physical threat to law enforcement, that provides incentive for law enforcement to shoot first and ask questions later.\"\n\nTestifying before the House Judiciary Committee in December 2017, shortly after the report was leaked to the press, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the FBI investigates as domestic terrorism only cases involving federal crimes that include the use or attempted use of violence in furtherance of political or social goals. \"We don't have that, we don't investigate,\" Wray said. \"It doesn't matter whether they are right-wing, left-wing, or any other wing.\" FBI Director Christopher Wray arrives to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on oversight of the FBI in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 7, 2017. Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images \"We take respect for the First Amendment very seriously, and in this context, as in every other domestic terrorism context, we want to be very clear with people, and all the American people, that we do not investigate rhetoric, ideology, opinion, no matter who might consider it extremist,\" he added. \"What we do investigate is when rhetoric, ideology, opinion takes that next step into the category of federal crime and of particular violence.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray arrives to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on oversight of the FBI in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 7, 2017.\n\nAt the hearing, Wray said that the \"black identity extremism\" report was based on both open-source information and ongoing FBI investigations. He also said, citing no specific numbers, that the bureau had \"about 50 percent more\" investigations of white supremacists than it did of \"black identity extremists.\" In subsequent meetings with lawmakers, he said he was unfamiliar with any investigations of \"black identity extremists.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, a spokesperson for the FBI wrote that the agency \"does not police ideology.\" The bureau, she added, will only initiate an investigation if there is an allegation of a federal crime or a threat to national security. \"Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"When an individual takes violent action based on belief or ideology - and breaks the law - the FBI will enforce the rule of law. The FBI cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual's race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of their constitutional rights, and we remain committed to protecting those rights for all Americans.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to answer The Intercept's questions about how various ideologies are presented, downplayed, or emphasized in threat assessment reports that the agency routinely circulates to law enforcement, or about how those reports might impact surveillance and policing of targeted communities, regardless of the threats they pose. At the 2017 Judiciary Committee hearing, as well as at a second hearing before the same committee in June 2018 , Wray also failed to address those questions.\n\n\"My big concern is that local law enforcement will misinterpret that and will clamp down on people exercising their First Amendment rights,\" Rep. Karen Bass, one of the report's fiercest critics in Congress, told him at the first hearing. Police stand watch as demonstrators protest the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 13, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images It's unclear how the \"black identity extremism\" report has been used by local law enforcement agencies. But if the threat is as serious as the FBI report implies, that hasn't turned into successful federal prosecutions. According to The Intercept's analysis , Davis and Baldwin's case was the only federal prosecution of individuals the FBI considers to be \"black identity extremists\" that resulted in a conviction. By comparison, the analysis found that 268 right-wing extremists were prosecuted in federal courts since 9/11 for crimes that appear to meet the legal definition of domestic terrorism, even though the Justice Department applied anti-terrorism laws against only 34 of them.\n\nPolice stand watch as demonstrators protest the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 13, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nWhile several news reports referred to the case of Christopher Daniels, a Texas activist who advocated for the rights of black gun owners, as the first known prosecution of a \"black identity extremist,\" the FBI appears to have retroactively used that label to refer to individuals it started surveilling as early as 2014, on the heels of the Ferguson protests. Daniels, who also went by the name Rakem Balogun, was indicted of a weapons offense months after the release of the FBI report, but a judge dismissed the charge last May. The FBI declined to comment on any of these cases, as well as on the origins of the \"black identity extremist\" label.\n\nNone of the other five individuals referenced in the FBI's 2017 report were federally prosecuted. They include three black men who attacked and, in two cases, killed, police officers in New York, Baton Rouge, and Dallas, though the FBI's report fails to connect their actions to any specific group or clear ideology. A man who shot at two police stations in Indiana in October 2016 and another who drove his car toward three police officers in Arizona in September 2016 - both of whom were prosecuted on state charges - also appear to have acted independently of any groups or discernible ideology. Three were killed by police on the scene.\n\nDavis himself, while he had recently joined the New Black Panther Party, was found to have plotted the St. Louis bombings without the group's knowledge or support. And he was also known to police as a devotee of the Moorish Science Temple of America, a black variation of the overwhelmingly white sovereign citizen movement, a domestic extremist ideology well known to the FBI.\n\nThe only connection between the six men referenced in the report, besides their race, is a thread of anger at police that is common among tens of thousands of Americans who never committed or intended to commit acts of violence. \"In all of them, there is no connection to any national movement; the cases are not linked in any way,\" said Michael German, a former FBI agent and a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program. \"This was literally picking six random events and then imagining a movement around them.\"\n\n\"This is not just a failure of an intelligence product, but a dangerous intelligence product,\" German added. \"It spreads misinformation rather than intelligence.\" Olajuwon Ali Davis, far left, was one of a small group of people who went into the Ferguson Police Department to speak with Lt.

Craig Rettke on the night of Aug. 9, 2014, hours after Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.\n\nOn November 21, 2014, three months after Brown's killing, Davis and Baldwin were arrested in an FBI sting and indicted in federal court on weapons charges, accused of making false statements to buy guns at a Cabela's store where Baldwin worked.\n\nThree days later, a grand jury declined to charge Wilson for Brown's death. As protests once again engulfed St. Louis, news outlets citing unnamed law enforcement sources reported that Davis and Baldwin had bought what they thought was a pipe bomb and had plans to buy two more from undercover agents, and that they intended to blow up the city's celebrated arch and kill St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch and Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. In a packed courtroom, the friends and families of the accused dismissed those accusations as \" lies ,\" while the New Black Panther Party's national leadership called them a \" FRAME UP attempt .\" Davis's wife, who was pregnant and due in two weeks, fainted in court and went into early labor.\n\nThe most explosive allegations against Davis and Baldwin were not detailed in the original court filings. But in a revised federal indictment filed months after their arrest, the two were charged with additional crimes, including attempting to \"damage and destroy, by means of explosives, a building, vehicle and other property.\"\n\nIf the court documents were light on detail, the press coverage was not. In the heated atmosphere that followed the Ferguson protests, many news outlets hyped the story, writing headlines that mischaracterized Davis and Baldwin as affiliates of the \" Black Panthers ,\" and letting anonymous law enforcement sources drive the narrative around their alleged scheme. The press picked on the story's most salacious details: Davis and Baldwin had planned to buy more bombs, several outlets reported , but had been unable to do so because they were waiting for funds to be disbursed to \"a girlfriend's\" EBT card - a detail, presumably leaked by law enforcement, that turned out to be false .\n\nAccording to their nearly identical sentencing plea agreements, Davis and Baldwin, who met during the protests over Brown's killing, discussed acquiring guns and bombs and wanting to organize Ferguson protesters to \"be like an army.\" Baldwin told an FBI informant that he wanted to \"build bombs and blow things up.\"\n\n\"We are at war, you understand, bro,\" he told the informant. According to Baldwin's plea, Davis \"put it out there that he was a terrorist\" - a reference that appears to have been scrapped from Davis's own plea. The Gateway Arch, which according to earlier accounts had been the pair's main target, was never actually mentioned in conversations recorded by law enforcement, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported .

Photo: David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via Polaris For their part, law enforcement officials conceded that it was unlikely that Davis and Baldwin would have been capable of executing a bomb plot, and that it was unclear how they would have made it through airport-style security at the arch; nonetheless, they painted the duo as a dangerous threat.\n\nPastor Spencer Booker addresses the crowd at a press conference, where a boycott and protest of Black Friday shopping was announced by the Justice for Michael Brown Leadership Coalition in St. Louis on Nov. 12, 2014. Olajuwon Ali Davis, far left, participated in the public announcement.\n\nRichard Callahan, then-U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Missouri, said in a statement after the guilty plea that the disruption of the plot days before the grand jury's rejection of charges against Wilson \" undoubtedly saved lives . Luckily for all of us, we'll never know just how many.\" But that seemed to contradict an earlier interview, in which he had said that a lot of Davis's and Baldwin's ideas were \"totally unrealistic and impractical, and we didn't include [in the indictment] all of the things they rambled on about, to not sensationalize the case or make it more than it is.\" Callahan did not respond to The Intercept's request for comment. Kenneth Tihen, a lead prosecutor in the case, declined to comment.\n\nDavis and Baldwin pleaded guilty to explosives and gun charges in June 2015, and in September 2015 they were sentenced to seven-year prison terms. (Davis's father told The Intercept that before their plea, prosecutors had threatened his son with the possibility of 30 years in prison.)\n\nAt sentencing, Davis called his actions \" reckless, irresponsible and just stupid .\" Baldwin's attorney said on behalf of his client that Baldwin also apologized for \"his stupidity.\" Davis's attorney did not respond to The Intercept's requests for comment; Baldwin's declined to comment. Davis and Baldwin, who are currently in prison, could not be reached for comment.\n\nBut those close to them maintain that their ordeal was a classic case of entrapment.\n\n\"He was tricked,\" Henry Davis, Olajuwon Davis's father, told The Intercept. \"They wanted to set an example through my son to show that we are onto you all. The FBI, the federal government, is onto you activist people. We're watching you; this can happen to you too.\"\n\nHenry Davis said that FBI \"agents\" befriended his son during the Ferguson protests, then offered him money, marijuana, and hotel stays. They later moved into his apartment complex and spent weeks hanging out with him, talking about \"the resistance.\"\n\nHis son, he said, felt obligated to do what they asked. \"They pretended to be part of the whole movement, said that they wanted to be down,\" Henry Davis said. He added that FBI agents gave his son and Baldwin the money they used to buy the guns, claiming that they couldn't buy the weapons themselves because of felony records. But the same agents later insisted that Davis and Baldwin pay for the pipe bombs with their own money. That should have made his son suspicious, Henry Davis said.\n\n\"I'm not trying to justify his actions, because I'm ashamed, and I've expressed my disappointment to my son,\" said Henry Davis. But, he added, \"Olajuwon never had the intention of harming anyone. He's actually harmless. ... They got him.\"\n\nBaldwin's father, Berlin Baldwin Jr., also told The Intercept that his son was caught in a trap. \"If you believe in what you hear on TV, yeah, you would think he was a terrorist,\" he said. The elder Baldwin readily admitted that his son made a mistake and committed a crime, but added, \"He is not no terrorist. They just went after somebody and wrapped him up in it. And he's none of what they're saying. Just none of that stuff is true.\"\n\nDaniels, the Dallas gun activist who federal authorities tried and failed to prosecute as a \"black identity extremist,\" put it more bluntly. \"A lot of people in this movement are not fully developed and mature individuals,\" he told The Intercept, noting that he himself had staved off entrapment attempts by law enforcement. \"If I go to any white college in America and talk to a whole bunch of 20-year-olds, and be like, 'Hey man, I got some grenades, would you like to buy some?' - somebody's going to buy them. It's like offering a gun to a baby.\"\n\nBrandon Orlando Baldwin appears to have been politicized by the protests over Brown's killing. Three days after the shooting, Baldwin changed his Facebook profile picture to one of himself wearing a black beret - a symbol of the Black Panthers - and in the following months, his social media posts alternated between enraged comments about police brutality and pictures of himself with his young daughter.\n\nBrandon Orlando Baldwin and his daughter. Photo: Courtesy of the Baldwin family In one post about the proliferation of videos showing police abuse, he wrote, \"Stop filming and start blow'n they fuckin heads off... or beaten they Ass with they batons... When r we gonna really say enough is enough and stop turning the fuckin cheek for ppl who wouldn't turn on the water if yo Ass was on fire.\" In October 2014, a month before his arrest and while he was already under FBI surveillance, he posted: \"I wonder how many of my Followers are FEDS.\"\n\nBrandon Orlando Baldwin and his daughter.\n\nTo his family, Baldwin's arrest came as a shock, his father told The Intercept. His parents had not even known that he had started going to the protests in Ferguson until a family friend told his father that he had seen him on TV. \"I immediately called him and said, What the hell are you doing?\" Berlin Baldwin Jr. said.\n\n\"He might have been a protester, but he's not an activist,\" the senior Baldwin added, arguing that his son was young, naive, and new to the world of protests and activism. \"To me and the family, we feel that he was brainwashed. ... It was just a big mistake in his life, thinking that he was joining something that was important, being young.\"\n\nDavis had a longer history of political engagement. He had been a valedictorian in high school and won a full scholarship to the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he was studying economics, his father told The Intercept. Davis was also a promising actor, and in 2013 he starred in an award-winning independent film that was released last year. \"The story surrounding his arrest and crime aren't a full picture,\" Robert Herrera, the film's director, said in an interview . \"I think people would have a hard time reconciling who they see on screen versus what they read about him - and I think that is something to think about when you read about all the young minorities out in this country who are considered irredeemable criminals.\" \"The bureau's fever dreams of leftist subversion have undermined American efforts for social justice.\"\n\nIn college, inspired by an African history class, Davis learned about the Moorish movement, a group that's grown considerably in recent years, whose beliefs are a mixture of sovereign citizen ideology - a historically right-wing and white supremacist ideology whose adherents reject the legitimacy of government institutions - and devotion to the Moorish Science Temple of America. The senior Davis, who is a vocal Trump supporter and hopes the president will pardon his son, had dreamed that Olajuwon Davis would become the first black secretary of the Treasury. But to his father's horror, Davis joined the Moors, dropped out of college, and moved back to St. Louis. \"The Moors convinced him that he was too black and too powerful to work for the government,\" his father said.\n\nBecause they reject government authority, including that of law enforcement, sovereign citizens are perceived by police agencies as a top threat . But the FBI's \"black identity extremism\" report, while noting \"sparse evidence\" of a convergence of sovereign citizen extremism and Moorish beliefs, said that the connection is clearest in the production of fraudulent personal identification documents. \"Not all self-identified Moors are sovereign citizens, and not all sovereign citizen Moors engage in violence against law enforcement or other illegal activity,\" the FBI conceded in the report.\n\nDavis filed an \"Abjuration of Citizenship\" document with the Moorish nation movement, according to the Anti-Defamation League , and declared himself an \"aboriginal indigenous Moorish national of Northwest Amexem,\" the Moorish name for North America.\n\nHe carried a Moorish ID and said he had been tased and arrested in 2013 after attempting to make a \"tax-free\" purchase at a gas station using the ID. In social media posts, he described St. Louis as a \"Slave Capital in a Slave State!\" and the Gateway Arch as a \"Symbol of Our destruction and demise.\" According to his father, Davis met out-of-state members of the New Black Panther Party after Brown's killing and was quickly recruited to lead the group's local chapter. He befriended two FBI informants shortly thereafter. A screenshot of the Moorish ID that Olajuwon Ali Davis shared in a YouTube video where he discussed sovereign citizenship. Screenshot: The Intercept The older Davis said his son did not realize that he was being framed, but the younger Davis indicated in social media posts that he knew he was under surveillance. \"Family and Friends, every day I got Caucasians following me in SUV trucks,\" he wrote on Facebook two days before his arrest. \"Please be advised that if you show any signs of noncompliance with this Devil they will try to assassinate you.\"\n\nA screenshot of the Moorish ID that Olajuwon Ali Davis shared in a YouTube video where he discussed sovereign citizenship.\n\nIn prison, Davis has been taking classes, reading Paulo Coelho novels, recording himself reading books to his children, and volunteering to support fellow inmates who were placed on suicide watch, he wrote last year in a letter to the judge who sentenced him. \"I recognize that my incarceration was due to my failure to adhere to the principles of unwavering faith and affirming peace in thought and in action,\" he wrote. \"My imprisonment has given me the chance to once again develop a perspective that is sound and humane.\"\n\nAs protests over Brown's killing intensified in Ferguson and spilled across the country over the next months and years, so did the FBI's scrutiny of protesters. In November 2014, days before the Ferguson grand jury's decision and Davis and Baldwin's arrest, the bureau circulated an internal bulletin warning law enforcement of \"Potential Criminal Reactions to Missouri Grand Jury Announcement.\" Two years later, after protests against police brutality had engulfed Baltimore, Chicago, and several other cities, the FBI again issued an intelligence bulletin, warning that \"Black Separatist Extremists' Call for Retaliation in Response to Police-Involved Incidents Could Incite Acts of Violence against Law Enforcement.\"\n\nBy 2017, the FBI had given this presumed threat a new name: Black Identity Extremism, or what the bureau claimed was a growing, violent, and racially motivated movement targeting law enforcement. Filled with innuendo and stereotypes, the 12-page report that first introduced the label was written so imprecisely that the very definition of a \"black identity extremist\" was left grammatically incomplete, making its meaning unclear:\n\nThe FBI defines black identity extremists as individuals who seek, wholly or in part, through unlawful acts of force or violence, in response to perceived racism and injustice in American society and some do so in furtherance of establishing a separate black homeland or autonomous black social institutions, communities, or governing organizations within the United States.\n\nThe report also explicitly connected its analysis to the Ferguson protests, focusing on incidents of what it called \"premeditated attacks against law enforcement officers since 2014.\"\n\n\"The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since [Ferguson] have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity, within the BIE movement,\" it noted, adding that agency had \"high confidence\" in its assessment. \"The FBI further judges it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans, and in some cases, their identified affiliations with violent extremist groups.\"\n\nHansford, the activist and professor, told The Intercept that law enforcement took legitimate grievances about a broken system as personal attacks against them, and fabricated a nonexistent threat to repress criticism. \"The Black Lives Matter protesters and other black protesters oftentimes are protesting the police themselves, so it's a situation of self-interest where [police] feel personally attacked,\" he said. \"The problem is there really hasn't been a major [African-American] group that has in any way, shape, or form been a tangible threat to law enforcement, physically, since the Black Liberation Army,\" Hansford added, citing a militant black nationalist group active in the 1970s. \"It's been over 40 years.\"\n\nLawmakers also condemned the report. In addition to Wray's meetings with the Congressional Black Caucus and testimonies about it at two separate House Judiciary Committee hearings, Bass memorably grilled then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the report's claims at a different committee hearing. Sessions said he hadn't read the report and couldn't name an African-American organization that had committed violence against police. Moments after Bass asked him whether he considered the Ku Klux Klan to be \"white identity extremists,\" Sessions quipped that the names of any white supremacist groups were \"not coming to me at this moment.\"\n\nDespite a barrage of criticism the FBI did not retract or amend the report. Speaking before the House Judiciary Committee in December 2017, Wray said that the FBI would not \"withdraw intelligence assessments based on public outcry.\" Appearing before that committee again , in June 2018, he offered no answers to some legislators' questions about who exactly had written the report and based on what premises, but he said that their feedback \"prompted us to go back and take a very hard look at how we are bucketing the different categories of domestic terrorism.\" \"I think it's been a useful learning experience for us,\" Wray said, \"and I expect we will see some changes in how we do things going forward.\" Still, to date, the FBI has issued no clarification or amendment to the report.\n\nBut the \"black identity extremism\" report wasn't the only one the FBI produced that year warning about the threat posed by a nonexistent ideological group. As Jezebel reported in January, the FBI in 2017 issued a similar alert about what it called \"pro-choice extremists.\"\n\nIn a one-page memo obtained via public records request by the government transparency group Property of the People, the FBI lists the new category of made-up extremists along actually existing \"pro-life extremists\" under the common banner of \"Abortion Extremism Ideology.\" As was the case with \"black identity extremism,\" the FBI concedes in the report that its own evidence for claiming that such an ideology exists is scant. \"Only one pro-choice extremist has been prosecuted,\" the report notes. \"And that person acted independently and without any direct affiliation to a pro-choice group.\"\n\nAs Jezebel notes, that is a reference to Theodore Shulman, who served three years in prison for harassing and threatening to kill two leaders of the anti-abortion movement. The only killing of an anti-abortion activist came at the hands of a mentally ill man who had also killed someone else that day, and that showed no signs of being motivated by ideology.\n\nThe documents obtained by Property of the People also give a sense of how these reports might be put to use by law enforcement. In one email published by the group , a Washington state sheriff shares the FBI material with his staff with the following warning: \"Attached is the latest and greatest about groups we should be aware of. Some of them operate in Eastern Washington.\"\n\nProperty of the People called the equation of imaginary \"pro-choice extremism\" to the real \"pro-life extremism,\" whose adherents have murdered at least a dozen doctors and abortion providers, \"an especially egregious case of 'bothsidesism.'\"\n\n\"The FBI has a long, sad history of targeting progressive movements as threats to national security,\" Ryan Shapiro, the group's executive director, told The Intercept. \"From the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements to the animal rights, anti-fascist, pro-choice, and Black Lives Matter movements today, the bureau's fever dreams of leftist subversion have undermined American efforts for social justice.\"\n\nThe FBI has also done little to address criticism that while it has long warned of the \"persistent\" threat posed by white supremacist groups - and even investigated white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement, as The Intercept has reported - it has grossly undercounted the violent incidents stemming from white supremacist ideology. While a May 2017 FBI report argued that \"lone actors and small cells\" within the white supremacist extremist movement \"will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence,\" that report minimized the level of violence coming from these individuals, listing only \"one lethal and five potentially lethal attacks\" carried out by white supremacist extremists in 2016 and omitting, for instance, the case of Brent Ward Luyster, a neo-Nazi who murdered three people in 2016 while under FBI investigation.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2017, \"right-wing extremists\" were responsible for 274 murders - more than 70 percent of all murders carried out by domestic extremists, according to a review by the ADL . And of 34 extremist-related murders in 2017, 59 percent were related to right-wing extremism, including 53 percent involving individuals who explicitly espoused white supremacist views. But many of those cases were rarely discussed by officials in terms of domestic terrorism, nor were the accused charged under anti-terrorism laws, even though they appeared to be motivated by a clear ideology.\n\nInstead, as The Intercept's analysis revealed, the Justice Department applied anti-terrorism laws against only 34 of 268 right-wing extremists it prosecuted for crimes that appear to meet the legal definition of domestic terrorism - while also targeting 17 environmental and animal rights activists with anti-terrorism laws.\n\n\"They view terrorism through a distorted lens that overemphasizes nonviolent acts by groups opposed to government policy over acts of violence against marginalized groups here in the United States,\" said German, the former FBI agent, referring to the agency. \"The language is intentionally malleable because they want to include certain acts and exclude other similar acts, depending on who is committing them or who the victim of the crime is.\"\n\n\"The reason they're able to do this is because the term 'terrorist' is so nebulous, it's so abstract. Anything they don't like, they'll call terrorist,\" echoed Hansford, the activist and law professor. \"They will always resist having a more precise definition of terrorism because they want to use it as a tool to basically go after whoever they want to go after.\" Members of an FBI evidence response team work at the scene of the attack on police officers in Dallas on July 9, 2016. Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nMembers of an FBI evidence response team work at the scene of the attack on police officers in Dallas on July 9, 2016.\n\nIn addition to the case of Davis and Baldwin - which the FBI report inexplicably describes as involving only one unnamed suspect - the \"black identity extremism\" report mentions the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge in the summer of 2016. Those shootings followed the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, which were caught on video and reignited the national outrage sparked by Brown's killing two years earlier. The report also lists nonfatal attacks on police in New York, Indiana, and Arizona.\n\nBut despite the FBI's efforts to group the incidents together, there is no evidence that the perpetrators knew each other, belonged to any common groups, or subscribed to the same set of beliefs. Instead, the cases present a mix of resentment toward police, anger at the treatment of minorities, and mental health issues. At least two of the men referenced had expressed sovereign citizen beliefs: one was a Muslim convert who had shown fascination with jihadi violence, and two were military veterans who had sought treatment for symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, the ideologies that law enforcement has attributed to them appear to have been based on FBI agents scrolling through comments the men had made on social media.\n\nThree of the six referenced in the report were killed before their motives could be tested in court. Micah Johnson, who on July 7, 2016, shot and killed five law enforcement officers and wounded several others at a Dallas protest against police violence, told police negotiators before being killed in a standoff that \"he was upset about recent police shootings and white people, and expressed a desire to kill white people, especially white officers,\" according to the FBI report. The report notes that Johnson had \"searched and liked social media pages of BIE and black separatist groups\" and \"appeared to have been influenced by BIE ideology.\" It also cites news reports saying that he had been \"ousted from a local BIE group for being too radical.\" It's unclear what groups the FBI was referring to, since \"black identity extremist\" organizations do not exist.\n\nGavin Eugene Long, who shot six Baton Rouge police officers on July 17, 2016, killing three, had used \"black separatist rhetoric\" on social media and in a manifesto he left behind, in which he described his actions \"as a necessary evil ... in order to create substantial change,\" the FBI report notes, adding that Long had also declared himself a \"Moor,\" changed his \"slave\" name to a Moorish name, and was carrying a Moorish identification card at the time of his death. In videos and tweets posted shortly before the shooting, Long had praised Johnson, the Dallas shooter. He added, if \"anything happens to me ... don't affiliate me with anybody.\"\n\nBoth Johnson and Long were military veterans. Johnson had sought treatment for anxiety, depression, and hallucinations after returning from Afghanistan in 2014, according to the Veterans Health Administration, and he had reportedly told doctors that he heard voices and mortars exploding, and that he had panic attacks and nightmares. Long, who served with the Marines in Iraq between 2008 and 2009, had told doctors that he experienced symptoms of PTSD, though his ultimate diagnosis was \"adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\"\n\nThe FBI report also lists the case of Zale Thompson, who attacked four New York police officers with a hatchet in October 2014, injuring two. According to the report, Thompson had tattoos that \"indicated he was affiliated with a black separatist extremist group\" and \"pocket litter indicating he may have been associated with another black separatist group.\" The FBI report cites \"law enforcement reporting\" as its source, but doesn't mention that Thompson also appeared to have become fascinated by Islamic State propaganda videos and jihadi rhetoric.\n\nFinally, the report listed the cases, though not the names, of Damoine Wilcoxson and Marc Laquon Payne. Wilcoxson was sentenced to 37 years in Indiana state prison after shooting at two Indianapolis police stations in 2016, leaving behind delirious handwritten notes saying, \"White must die.\" Payne was accused of plowing his car into three officers in Arizona that same year. Authorities indicated that Payne, who has pleaded not guilty and is facing trial later this year, was impaired at the time and that his motives were unknown, but the FBI report notes that Payne's social media accounts \"indicated that he was tied to a BIE group and a Moorish group and that he was angry over police shootings since at least the killing of Brown in 2014.\"\n\nBut while the FBI stretched its definition of \"black identity extremism\" to include a disparate series of disconnected cases, white criminal suspects' connections to extremist groups are often discounted, German said. \"There's evidence that the shooter in Las Vegas had expressed some anti-government views that are in line with some far-right groups, but you don't see this rush to say he was a far-right extremist and to attribute those deaths to far-right extremism in the United States,\" he said, referring to the massacre of 59 people at a country music concert in 2017. \"That's where the politics of this kind of approach are very damaging and divisive in American society, because they do tend to reflect political views rather than the threat of violence.\" Rakem Balogun, photographed near his home in Dallas, Texas. Photo: Allison V. Smith\n\nRakem Balogun, photographed near his home in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe case of Rakem Balogun is often characterized as the first attempted federal prosecution of a \"black identity extremist\" since the FBI report about the supposed ideology. Balogun is a Dallas-based former Marine and a member of Guerrilla Mainframe, a pan-African group with a broad agenda ranging between universal health care and the abolition of the U.S. Constitution. He was also a member of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, which promotes the Second Amendment rights of African-Americans.\n\nBalogun, whose legal name is Christopher Daniels, was arrested in December 2017, when officers in riot gear pulled him and his 15-year-old son out of their house and forced them to stand outside in the cold, handcuffed and in their underwear. Balogun spent the next five months in jail on a single illegal firearms possession charge, while prosecutors tried and failed to paint him as a domestic terrorist. At his detention hearing, where Balogun was denied bail, an FBI agent testified that he had been under surveillance for two years, since video of him at an open-carry rally against police brutality circulated online, including on the right-wing conspiracy site InfoWars.\n\nThe video shows protesters, including Balogun, chanting, \"The only good pig is a pig that's dead\" and \"Oink oink, bang bang.\" Balogun's Facebook page \"openly and publicly advocates violence toward law enforcement,\" the FBI agent said . On the first anniversary of the July 2016 Dallas police shooting, Balogun posted several comments that appeared to celebrate shooter Micah Johnson. \"Today one year ago one Black Man brought Dallas Pig Department to their knees,\" he wrote.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nToday, Balogun says he always suspected that he was being watched. \"Anybody that knows a little bit about the history of black activism would know that once you become politically involved as a black person, especially as somebody who counters popular politics, that you will be watched,\" he told The Intercept months after a judge ordered his release. \"I don't mind having an audience. I'm not doing anything illegal and I don't advocate for anything illegal.\"\n\n\"The thing about it is, a lot of mature black nationalists, militants, are not into the concept of going to war with the police or the state or anything of that nature,\" he added, noting that he espouses what he called \"scientific revolutionary socialism,\" and that he believes in an individual's right to self-defense.\n\nUltimately, the case against Balogun hinged on an accusation that he was prohibited from owning a gun due to a 10-year-old misdemeanor conviction for domestic assault in another state. Prosecutors tried to convince him to take a plea deal, he said. \"Their plan was for me to be weak and sign for six months, and to feel guilty for being a black activist who promotes a culture of self-defense and self-preservation in a white nation. ... That's really the crime,\" he told The Intercept. He refused to take a deal.\n\nBalogun, who has long been an advocate for gun rights, said he's used to the double standard applied to black gun owners. Perhaps the most infamous example of that is Philando Castile, who was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop, which his girlfriend streamed on Facebook Live. Castile was a legal gun owner and told the officer he had a gun, but he was shot anyway while reaching for his license as ordered. Balogun told The Intercept that while police officers are generally friendly with open-carry demonstrators in Texas, black open-carry demonstrators routinely receive more hostile treatment.\n\nA federal judge ultimately dismissed the gun charge against him, but Balogun lost his job and home, and missed his newborn daughter's first months while he was in jail. He says he is now considering legal action to obtain whatever surveillance material the government may have gathered on him. Wray said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in June 2017 that he was not familiar with Balogun's case.\n\nBabu Omowale, a founder and director of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, told The Intercept that he is sure Balogun was not the only member under surveillance. The group, which is named after a co-founder of the Black Panther Party, is mostly made up of former members or the New Black Panther Party who have focused their activism on gun rights and self-defense in the black community, mostly staging open-carry rallies, neighborhood patrols, and in one case, counterdemonstrating as an anti-Muslim group rallied outside a Dallas mosque.\n\n\"We see them sitting outside of our meetings, watching us, but it's not going to stop us from organizing our people,\" said Omowale, referring to the FBI. \"We've known about it since the 1960s, when J. Edgar Hoover was over the counterintelligence program where he sought out black leadership.\" At a rally outside the U.S. Courthouse on Oct. 29, 1969, Fred Hampton, chair of the Illinois Black Panther Party, speaks at a protest against the trial of eight people accused of conspiracy to cause a riot during the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Photo: AP\n\nAt a rally outside the U.S. Courthouse on Oct. 29, 1969, Fred Hampton, chair of the Illinois Black Panther Party, speaks at a protest against the trial of eight people accused of conspiracy to cause a riot during the Democratic National Convention in 1968.\n\nThe FBI's leaked memo, as well as evidence that had already emerged that the FBI was targeting black activists for surveillance, drew widespread comparisons to the notorious COINTELPRO, a program aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, and sabotaging the civil rights, anti-war, and black liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s. \"Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the original 'Black Identity Extremists,'\" a HuffPost column noted . Several people called the FBI report \" COINTELPRO 2.0. \" The FBI itself referred to the civil rights era in its 2017 report, retroactively applying its new \"black identity extremist\" label to the now-defunct Black Liberation Army. \"BIEs have historically justified and perpetrated violence against law enforcement, which they perceived as representative of the institutionalized oppression of African Americans,\" the report argued. \"BIE violence peaked in the 1960s and 1970s in response to changing socioeconomic attitudes and treatment of blacks during the Civil Rights Movement.\"\n\nUnder the COINTELPRO umbrella, the FBI went from tracking King's every move and attempting to smear him, to surveilling Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, including by obtaining a floor map of his apartment, before Chicago police shot about 90 rounds into the apartment in 1969, killing Hampton and fellow Panther Mark Clark. At the same time, they routinely failed to intervene as white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan engaged in a sustained campaign of violence against civil rights activists and African-Americans.\n\nThe FBI report noted that between 1970 and 1984, the Black Liberation Army was involved in at least 38 criminal incidents, including 26 armed assaults, three assassinations, four bombings, and four hijackings and hostage-takings - half of them targeting law enforcement officers. But it made no reference to law enforcement violence against black activists, including the 1985 bombing of the Philadelphia headquarters of black liberation group MOVE, that killed 11 people.\n\nSpeaking before the House Judiciary Committee in November 2017, Wray called COINTELPRO \"one of the darker moments in FBI's history.\" \"It's something we are not proud of, but it's also something we have learned from,\" he said. But when Rep. Cedric Richmond asked him why the FBI's building continued to be named after J. Edgar Hoover - COINTELPRO's infamous architect - Wray replied, \"Like most people, he's complicated.\"\n\nThe \"black identity extremism\" report was hardly the first FBI effort to revive the tactics of COINTELPRO. In 2012, German, then at the American Civil Liberties Union, obtained public records revealing that the FBI had come up with yet another label to target what they claimed was a growing threat: \"black separatist\" domestic terrorism. Then, as now, the more recent violence driven by black nationalist ideology dated back decades, but the FBI included new warnings in its terrorism training materials that inexplicably connected the growing size of the black population in states like Georgia with a growing domestic terror threat. (As the ACLU noted at the time, the FBI had around the same time also invented what it called \"American Islamic Extremists.\")\n\n\"You would hope that a law enforcement agency learns from its past mistakes,\" said German. \"I think that's where the biggest failure is, that there are enough parallels to how the FBI reacted to protests in the 1960s and 1970s that should have dissuaded them from adopting similar approaches again.\"\n\nBut rather than learning from the past, it seems that the FBI is trying to maintain its old ways under a different name. While the ideologies that the terms \"black separatism\" and \"black identity extremism\" purport to represent would appear rather different, the FBI has recently folded both into the latter category, documents reveal. In an internal email exchange obtained by Property of the People and shared with The Intercept, Michael F. Paul, an official with the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, wrote to colleagues that the bureau had updated its definition of \"black separatist extremism\" in order \"to broaden it beyond simply those seeking 'separatism,'\" he wrote. \"The threat or movement has simply evolved,\" Paul added, \"and many are seeking more than/other than separation.\"\n\nShapiro, of Property of the People, said the reclassification aimed to cast an even wider net on black activists at a time when police accountability, rather than separatism, was their priority. \"Black Lives Matter isn't a separatist movement, and the FBI wanted to expand its surveillance of black activists and communities,\" he told The Intercept.\n\n\"With 'black identity extremism,' the FBI has expanded its 'black separatist extremist' category to also designate groups like Black Lives Matter a security threat,\" he added. \"The 'BIE' classification is the FBI's bureaucratic umbrella for targeting as terrorists black people who expose the daily terror against their families and neighborhoods perpetrated by unaccountable killers in blue.\"\n\nTo many black activists, that's a familiar story.\n\n\"The government has always kept an eye on black people because they want to keep us in a certain social order,\" said Omowale, of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club. \"The term 'black identity extremist' may be a new term, but the way that the government operates is nothing new. They've been doing it since we've been in this country, since black people, even slaves, tried to organize for some type of freedom.\"\n\nWAIT!

Two Cases Could Change That.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nE ven before Dorian Hamilton arrived at the Wake County Justice Center for jury duty on January 10, 2017, she told friends and family how much she wanted to serve. \"They said I was crazy,\" Hamilton recalled. \"They were like, 'You know you don't get paid?' And I was like, 'Oh yeah, I don't care.'\"\n\nHamilton, who is Black, moved to North Carolina nearly 20 years ago. Early on, she recognized that the racial dynamics were different than in Long Island, where she grew up. There, she never came across a Black judge, police officer, or teacher, she said. But in North Carolina, she saw more people of color - even a Black judge - and thought that there could be more racial justice. \"Maybe you aren't judged so much by color here,\" she thought. \"Maybe because there are more minorities here, maybe things are a little more fair.\"\n\nBy the time Hamilton was called for voir dire on the afternoon of January 24, she knew it was a high-profile capital case. Nathan Holden, a Black man, was accused of killing his in-laws and attempting to murder his former wife. Hamilton was told the trial could last several weeks, but she still sought to serve on the jury. She remembered being thoughtful in her answers to questions from the prosecutors, carefully avoiding saying anything that would give either side pause. She told prosecutors she owned a dance studio in Raleigh, worked part time as a realtor, and that serving on the jury wouldn't be a burden. She answered questions about her experiences with law enforcement, sharing that she once helped a police officer buy a home and also that an officer once pulled a gun on her for no good reason.\n\nWhen asked by Wake County Assistant District Attorney Matt Lively what effect this negative experience would have on her ability to judge an officer's credibility, Hamilton said, \"I don't think it would have an effect on me at all. Because just like people are good, there are bad.\"\n\nLively said he thought that was a \"good way to look at\" the experience and then, according to court records, proceeded to question Hamilton for an hour. He asked about her views regarding the death penalty, police violence, custody disputes, gun ownership, mental health, and implicit bias. Hamilton expressed decidedly balanced opinions on these issues - \"I do believe there are issues with police being overzealous sometimes, but if you see what they are dealing with, then sometimes it may be necessary,\" she said - but also said she was concerned that her fellow jurors might be biased against Holden because he is Black, wore dreadlocks, and was shackled when they saw him for the first time.\n\nLively then struck Hamilton from the jury, using what is known as a peremptory strike to dismiss her without cause. During jury selection in a criminal trial, potential jurors can be excused \"for cause\" when the judge finds that they cannot decide the case impartially. The defense and prosecution may also exercise a limited number of peremptory strikes to excuse jurors without offering a reason. Lively's strike of Hamilton didn't go unnoticed by Holden's attorneys Elizabeth Hambourger, from the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, and Jonathan Broun, from North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services. They had seen this happen before.\n\nHamilton, unsure what was going on, was asked to wait outside the courtroom. Hambourger, believing racial bias was at the heart of Hamilton's dismissal, challenged the strike under the 1986 U.S. Supreme Court decision Batson v. Kentucky , which North Carolina's criminal legal system has had trouble complying with for more than 35 years.\n\nElizabeth Hambourger poses for a portrait in front of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nI n 1983, an all-white jury in Kentucky convicted James Batson, a Black man, of second-degree burglary and receipt of stolen goods. During jury selection, the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to strike all four Black people eligible for jury duty. When Batson's lawyer objected, claiming that his client's rights to an impartial jury and equal protection under the law were violated, the trial judge denied the motion.\n\nOn appeal, the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, citing Swain v. Alabama , a 1965 U.S. Supreme Court decision requiring defendants to show that prosecutors systematically discriminated against potential Black jurors across cases - an incredibly high bar for proving purposeful discrimination. By the time Batson's case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985, few had ever won relief under Swain.\n\nBut in the spring of 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges at Batson's trial violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, reversing his conviction and reaffirming the notion that discrimination against nonwhite jury candidates was unconstitutional - but only if a judge found it to be purposeful.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSince Batson, a three-step process for determining discriminatory intent requires prosecutors to justify each peremptory strike challenged by the defense with race-neutral reasons, a barrier Justice Thurgood Marshall predicted would be easy to overcome. \"Any prosecutor can easily assert facially neutral reasons for striking a juror, and trial courts are ill equipped to second-guess those reasons,\" Marshall wrote in his concurring opinion in Batson.\n\nIndeed, while some states claim progress, racial bias across the jury selection process has continued to be discovered decades after Batson. A 2015 study found that prosecutors in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, used peremptory strikes on Black potential jurors at three times the rate of non-Black jurors; Texas Monthly recently reported that a district clerk in Brazoria County used race to sort jury panels , which could result in the reversal of hundreds of convictions; and in the past year, the Queens, New York, DA's office vacated the convictions of three men based on evidence of racial discrimination during jury selection - the prosecutor had used handwritten notes reminding him to use his peremptory strikes to eliminate women and people of color. ( Among his notes : \"no Hispanics,\" \"get white jurors,\" and \"established whites.\")\n\nStill, trial courts around the country often fail to find Batson violations, and appellate courts often show their deference to those rulings. But North Carolina's Batson record is particularly poor. In 2009, the state enacted the Racial Justice Act , intended to prevent the execution of people whose trials were tainted by racial bias in jury selection or other types of racial discrimination. It provided people on death row with the opportunity to challenge their sentence if they could prove that race played a significant role in their trial, and if they won relief, their death sentence would be commuted to life in prison without parole. Republicans, fearing an end to the state death penalty, repealed the Racial Justice Act in 2013 and attempted to apply the move retroactively. In June 2020, however, the state's Supreme Court found that the retroactive use of the repeal was unconstitutional and restored the law's protections for people who filed claims before its repeal.\n\nThe necessity of the Racial Justice Act was demonstrated by a 2012 Michigan State University study of capital cases tried between 1990 and 2010, which found that prosecutors in North Carolina excluded Black jurors because of their race - 2.5 times more often than non-Black jurors.\n\nA 2016 University of North Carolina Law Review study marking the 30th anniversary of Batson found that the state's appellate courts had yet to find that a prosecutor who provided a race-neutral reason violated Batson in 114 cases involving nonwhite jurors. By contrast, Alabama appellate courts have found Batson violations 80 times.\n\n\"North Carolina is often billed as a racially moderate state compared to other southern states,\" H. Timothy Lovelace Jr., a law professor at Duke University, said. \"So in some ways it really is striking that state courts in North Carolina have historically been so reluctant to tackle the issue of jury discrimination.\"\n\nThat could soon change. North Carolina's Court of Appeals and Supreme Court are currently reconsidering Batson claims in the cases of two Black men from Forsyth County who have strong claims that prosecutors discriminated against Black jurors. If the appellate courts rule in their favor, the men will receive a new trial. The Batson claims in Holden's case will be reheard in trial court and could return to the Court of Appeals.\n\nDavid Weiss, an attorney in North Carolina who has represented people sentenced to death in appellate and post-conviction proceedings, said it was \"embarrassing\" that North Carolina appellate courts have yet to recognize discrimination against a Black juror. \"There's either two explanations for that. One, there's no race discrimination in North Carolina, or two, our courts have been doing something wrong for decades. I think that question kind of answers itself.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina is seen in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nI n 1994, Russell Tucker walked out of a Super Kmart shopping center in Winston-Salem wearing a coat and a pair of boots he had just stolen, according to prosecutors. When store employees approached Tucker in the parking lot, Tucker shot at them, killing the store's security guard. Tucker ran but was soon met by two police officers in a patrol car. He fired five more shots, wounding both. He fled into some nearby woods and was caught within the hour.\n\nIn 1996, an all-white jury in Winston-Salem sentenced Tucker, who is Black, to death.\n\nOne of the prosecutors on Tucker's case, Forsyth County Assistant District Attorney Rob Lang, had previously been trained on how to get around Batson challenges. At \"Top Gun II,\" a program sponsored by the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, Lang received a worksheet titled \" Batson Justifications: Articulating Juror Negatives \" that provided 10 explanations prosecutors could use if a peremptory strike was challenged under Batson. Among them: \"inappropriate dress,\" defined as \"attire may show lack of respect for the system, immaturity or rebelliousness\"; \"body language\" (\"arms folded, leaning away from questioner, obvious boredom may show anti-prosecution tendencies\"); and \"attitude\" (\"air of defiance, lack of eye contact with Prosecutor, eye contact with defendant or defense attorney\").\n\nThe worksheet was not discovered until 2012, when lawyers for Errol Duke Moses, another Forsyth County man on death row, were given access to prosecutor files from a number of capital cases, including Tucker's. In 2019, the New York Times editorial board cited the worksheet when it wrote that North Carolina \"has long had one of the most racially biased criminal-justice systems in the country.\"\n\nWeiss, the North Carolina attorney, saw that the Batson worksheet was problematic early on, proof of prosecutors trying to \"game the system.\" But he later realized that it had even more troubling connotations: The justifications themselves were inherently racist.\n\n\"The idea that Black citizens who've reported for jury service are not sufficiently deferential to white prosecutors or are not making eye contact or don't look right to the prosecutor really have - you might say echoes, but in some ways - very direct parallels to earlier eras of very explicit racism when Black people were really expected to show deference to white people,\" Weiss said.\n\nNow the worksheet is at the center of Tucker's Batson claim in front of the North Carolina Supreme Court, which he brought under the Racial Justice Act. His attorneys from the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, Hambourger and Mark Pickett, claim the worksheet proves that Lang and his co-counsel David Spence intentionally struck Black jurors in his case. In a brief filed with the North Carolina Supreme Court in July , they challenged the prosecution's response to the Batson objections raised at trial. \"They claimed they struck Black jurors for being unregistered to vote, but accepted numerous white jurors who were likewise not registered,\" Hambourger and Pickett wrote of the trial prosecutors. \"They offered absurd reasons for striking Black jurors, for example, complaining that a Black juror was 'monosyllabic' when answering mostly yes-or-no questions.\"\n\nThe state argues that Tucker's claim is without merit and should be procedurally barred, even while conceding that there are problems with the Batson worksheet. The worksheet on its own is not proof of racial bias, argued North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein in a September court filing.\n\nLang, Spence, and a spokesperson for the North Carolina attorney general's office declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Oral arguments will likely be held in 2022.\n\n\"If prosecutors across the state happen to be coming up with reasons for striking overwhelmingly more Black jurors than white jurors, even if there's no hatred in their individual hearts when they do this, obviously there is a structural cause for that,\" Pickett said. \"There's no way this could just be happening by chance, that across all these trials, Black people keep getting removed at a much higher rate. It's a huge problem, and it's not just a problem for defendants. It's a tremendous problem that prosecutors across the state seem to be sending the message to Black North Carolina citizens, and other nonwhite North Carolina citizens, that they are less qualified to sit on these very serious cases.\"\n\nHenry White at his wedding in 1990.\n\nI n September , prosecutors with the North Carolina attorney general's office conceded that Batson claims from Henry White, a Black man serving a life sentence for shooting and killing a man during a robbery at a paint and body shop in Winston-Salem in 1996, should be reheard.\n\nLike Tucker, he was prosecuted by Spence, who sought the death penalty even though there were no eyewitnesses and no physical evidence tying White to the murder. White was sentenced to life without parole but still maintains that his cousin, who testified against him, is responsible for the murder .\n\nAccording to court documents, Spence struck two Black women during jury selection and admitted in court that race was a factor in his decision. \"Both Black females, both 27 years old,\" Spence told the court when his strikes were challenged by the defense. To overcome Batson, Spence recited a litany of seemingly race-neutral reasons for striking the two jurors, including the fact that one lived with her mother and that they both worked in health care. \"State thinks that people who want to save lives don't want to take lives,\" Spence added.\n\nThe trial judge overruled a challenge to the strikes from defense attorneys, and the jurors were dismissed. The next year, however, an appeals court found that race did play a predominant factor in the exclusion of the two Black jurors, the first and only time the court has done so. Still, it wasn't \"based solely on race,\" the court ruled, and the strikes - and the subsequent conviction - were found lawful. In the 35 years following Batson, this is the closest North Carolina's appeals courts have come to upholding a claim of race discrimination against a juror of color.\n\nBut in a brief filed in September , Stein, the attorney general, admitted that there was \"significant uncertainty\" surrounding whether the standard set forth in Batson was correctly met at trial and asked that his claims be remanded back to superior court. In late October, the Court of Appeals agreed to rehear White's claims.\n\nWhite said he's hopeful that the potential remand will lead to his release. \"I've been in here for 25 and half years for a murder I didn't commit,\" White said. \"And the person that committed the murder is still out there on the street - never did one day for it. I'm ready to come home. I've missed all my kids' young life and teenage life, and all of them are grown.\"\n\nHambourger, who represents both Tucker and White, said she's grateful for the state's response in White's case - she only wishes it would have taken the same step in Tucker's. \"They want to kill Mr. Tucker.\" Indeed, the last person to be executed in North Carolina - Samuel Flippen, who died by lethal injection in 2006 - was also prosecuted in Forsyth County. Flippen was sentenced to death for killing his 2-year-old stepdaughter; in June, attorneys for her biological father filed a motion in Forsyth Superior Court suggesting that she was killed by her mother.\n\nThe Wake County Justice Center is seen in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31, 2021.\n\nT o understand why North Carolina prosecutors have been so successful in their efforts to thwart Batson, Irving Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, suggests starting with judges, who he describes as \"the front line of the Batson challenge.\" Joyner, an attorney for the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, signed an amicus brief in support of Tucker's claim in July.\n\nJoyner said many judges are former prosecutors and place a lot of trust in them. \"If innately in your belief system is that whatever they [prosecutors] do is all right, then you're not going to find a Batson violation or a reason to question a prosecutor's explanation of why a person of color or gender has been removed from the jury,\" Joyner said. Some judges don't even believe in Batson, he added.\n\nThere are also judges who don't believe that racism exists in the criminal legal system. Judge Jefferson Griffin, elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals in 2020, wrote in a September concurrence related to a traffic-stop case that \"the law is color blind and applies equally to every citizen in the United States of America,\" a rebuke to a post-George Floyd statement about racial bias from former North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nJoyner also said it's also important to examine how prosecutors are trained, like in Top Gun II. \"Prosecutors of old are training prosecutors anew,\" Joyner said. \"That is the standard, and those old practices prevail irrespective of a change at the top or a change in the suggested methodology for dealing with jury selection.\"\n\nSpence, who, according to the Michigan State University study , struck 62 percent of Black jurors across four capital cases compared to just 20 percent of white jurors, led a Batson training at a capital litigation seminar in 2011 - nearly 15 years after admitting to striking jurors because they were Black. According to a study conducted by the Jury Sunshine Project of felony trials in North Carolina that same year, \"prosecutors in Forsyth County removed black jurors from the box three times more often than they removed white jurors.\"\n\nBrendon Woods, the chief public defender of Alameda County, California, recognizes the pattern and practice inherent in jury discrimination. The state has an appellate record on Batson on par with North Carolina. So in late August, Woods took to Twitter and laid out a plan for making juries more diverse, some of which has already been accomplished in California through state legislation, like the end of a ban on people convicted of felonies from serving on juries and paying low-income jurors more to serve. In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law legislation guaranteeing low-income jurors in San Francisco $100 a day for their service.\n\nAnother piece of key legislation, set to take effect for criminal trials in California in 2022, is A.B. 3070 , which Woods describes as \"a tremendous fix to Batson.\" Modeled after a similar rule enacted in Washington state in 2018, the law prohibits the peremptory strike of a juror just because they had a negative experience with law enforcement. Perhaps no state has gone as far as Arizona, whose Supreme Court eliminated peremptory strikes altogether in August.\n\n\"Batson allowed prosecutors to remove Black people for a thousand reasons except saying, 'I'm kicking you off because you're Black,'\" Woods said. \"What was most insidious about it is that you're removing Black people from being on a jury based on what I always call 'the Black experience' - removing Black people from juries because they don't trust police officers or because they had a bad interaction with a police officer or because they believe police engage in racial profiling.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experience as a Black man working in the criminal legal system, Woods added, \"Would I be able to sit as a juror independent of me being a lawyer, based on my experiences? Probably not. There isn't a prosecutor in the world that would keep me - just because I've had some negative experience with law enforcement. That's just being Black, right?\"\n\nDorian Hamilton poses for a portrait outside the Wake County Justice Center in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 31. 2021.\n\nA s soon as Hamilton stepped outside that Wake County courtroom in 2017, Hambourger challenged Lively's strike under Batson.\n\nWhen Lively responded with his race-neutral reasons, he first pointed to Hamilton's negative experience with law enforcement and her acknowledgment that racial profiling exists. \"You know, we never got to a place where she could be challenged for cause, but I think that her concerns give us a real legitimate doubt that she would actually be able to return that sentence if she were called upon by the evidence,\" he said. Lively also cited Hamilton's views on the death penalty along with the concerns she had about other jurors' potential bias.\n\nJudge Paul Ridgway quickly denied the defense's Batson challenge, and Hamilton was dismissed. The whole process lasted 10 minutes.\n\nHamilton said she wanted to serve on the jury because she wanted to be part of the trial and believed that she would have been unbiased and honest in her service. To Hamilton, it didn't matter that Holden was Black, or that she thought racial profiling existed, or that she had nuanced views on the death penalty, or that a police officer had pulled a gun on her for no reason.\n\n\"Yeah, you have negative experiences,\" she said. \"But that's not going to cloud my judgement. I'm not going to just let him go free because we're both Black.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the jury took just over a day to find Holden guilty of first-degree murder and only a few hours to sentence him to life instead of death. Holden was prosecuted in Wake County - where DA Lorrin Freeman has sought the death penalty at trial more than prosecutors in any other North Carolina county and where her prosecutors continue to seek death despite juries repeatedly returning life without parole sentences . Damon Chetson, who is running against Freeman in the Democratic primary in 2022, has said he will not seek the death penalty if he's elected.\n\nIn December 2019, Holden appealed his conviction. Batson is at the heart of his appeal , citing the peremptory strikes of seven potential jurors who are female, Black, or both, like Hamilton. According to a 2021 affidavit prepared for another case Lively prosecuted this summer, he struck Black jurors in capital cases at 2.5 times the rate of non-Black jurors. The odds of that disparity occurring were 1 in 1000, signaling that race was likely the motivating factor for those strikes, the affidavit noted. Lively declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nIn December 2020, the North Carolina Court of Appeals remanded Holden's case back to Superior Court, where another Batson hearing will be held. He will likely return to the Court of Appeals and then the North Carolina Supreme Court, where he may make history - if Tucker, White, or someone else doesn't do it first. No hearing date has been set.\n\nHamilton was disappointed that the opportunity for her to serve on a jury was taken away. She also admits to feeling a little naive for thinking that the reason could have been for something other than her race. \"It was just the fact that it was who I was,\" she said, \"that made it so they didn't want me.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Chicago Police Are 14 Times More Likely to Use Force Against Young Black Men Than Against Whites\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nInternal Chicago police files document thousands of police uses of force over more than a decade. Nearly 90 percent were against people of color.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nPart 4\n\nVideo footage of a police officer shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald sparked citywide protests in November 2015 and ignited Chicago's ongoing movement for police reform, but the Chicago Police Department's records show the gaping racial disparities in everyday use of force that played a role in creating the deep distrust in the city's police department among communities of color.\n\nThe data shows not only police shootings, but also thousands of regular police uses of force over more than a decade - involving an average of 10 people every day - documenting cases in which officers tackled, tased, or used other types of force on civilians, nearly 90 percent of whom were people of color. The data provides a more detailed look at the pattern of unconstitutional force discovered by the Justice Department investigation that opened shortly after the release of the McDonald video.\n\nIn late July, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan announced their plan to fix the Chicago Police Department. The 225-page draft document provides a detailed proposal for police reform, to be overseen by a federal judge.\n\nAs the Chicago Police Department confronts a potentially decade-long reform process, a new trove of data obtained by the Invisible Institute, and presented as part of the Citizens Police Data Project , provides the one of the most comprehensive looks at a big city police department's use of force. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Invisible Institute obtained more than 67,000 \"tactical response reports,\" covering uses of force by Chicago police officers against adults between late January 2004 and April 2016.\n\nOfficers complete these reports after incidents in which an officer uses serious force, such as a firearm or Taser, to subdue civilians they perceive to be resisting arrest or threatening others, or when a civilian is injured or claims they were injured by officers. Less serious types of force, such as handcuffing a suspect, do not typically require a form.\n\nThe data shows the scope of the problem facing the Chicago Police Department as it pursues wide-ranging reforms under the oversight of a federal judge. Across Chicago, most victims of officer uses of force were African-American, even in several neighborhoods where the residents are predominately white. Young black men were about 14 times more likely to experience a CPD use of force than young white men.\n\nThe Invisible Institute's analysis also suggests that Chicago's use-of-force tracking - a central part of the proposed reform - is seriously incomplete. Both experts and the data provided by CPD suggest that police officers frequently underreport uses of force against civilians, a fact that could make it more difficult for the department to determine whether reform efforts are succeeding.\n\nLearn more\n\nCPD's data shows that reported force is applied unevenly across Chicago. African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites each make up about a third of the city's population, but police report using force on these groups at sharply different rates. Between 2005 and 2015, roughly 72 percent of all CPD uses of force targeted African-Americans. A further 15 percent involved Hispanics, and 10 percent involved whites. Similar disparities exist in Taser uses and shootings, though most reports involve officers tackling, punching, or using open-hand strikes on civilians.\n\nThe racial disparities in reported uses of force are even more noticeable among younger people. African-American men between ages 20 and 34 experience police uses of force at a rate roughly 14 times their white peers. Black women in the same age range were about 10 times more likely to experience force than young white women and twice more likely to experience force than young white men.\n\nThe reported number of people who experienced force remained fairly steady between 2005 and 2015, rising from roughly 3,900 to about 4,200 in 2011 and declining to about 3,500 in 2015. The proportion of police force used against African-Americans remained steady even as black Chicagoans made up an increasingly smaller portion of the city's population.\n\nThe racial disparities in the police department's use-of-force reports exist across the city, including in largely white neighborhoods. The Jefferson Park police district on Chicago's far northwest side is home to many city workers and includes some of the only precincts in the city to back Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Although African-Americans make up only 1 percent of the district's population, they comprise 14 percent of the people who experienced police use of force.\n\nIn Chicago's Near North Side community area, home to high-rise apartments and dozens of night spots, African-Americans make up just 9 percent of the population, but make up nearly 60 percent of those subject to use of force.\n\nDemonstrators march down Clark Street towards Wrigley Field in a protest against gun violence in Chicago on August 2, 2018. Organizers of the march are calling for the resignation of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and want to bring attention to gun violence and poverty on the South and West Sides of Chicago.\n\nThese everyday uses of force add up. Researchers have pointed to daily police abuses and physical misconduct as a major element in creating community mistrust. Sam Walker , a policing expert at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, says that excessive force can have a huge impact on community relations, pointing out that \"it doesn't have to be serious uses of force, where some guy is hit with a billy club and there's blood or something. I think it's the little stuff, just shoving someone around, shoving some kid up against the wall, or throwing him to the ground, or up against a patrol car.\"\n\nDavid Harris , a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in racial profiling, points out that force disparities can have corrosive effects on communities. \"If you are a black person or a Hispanic person, you know you're disproportionately likely to face a use of force, [and] you're going to actually hesitate to call the police in the first place - and you need them - which of course makes the whole neighborhood, the whole area, more dangerous.\"\n\nHarris cautions that Chicago's racial disparities in force reports do not prove police discrimination on their own, warning that \"disparities by themselves do not necessarily equate to, or are not the same as, discrimination.\"\n\nThe Justice Department investigation of the Chicago police placed racial disparities in use of force in the context of other problematic policing it uncovered in Chicago's minority communities, declaring that \"the impact of these widespread constitutional violations, combined with unaddressed abusive and racially discriminatory conduct, have undermined the legitimacy of CPD and police-community trust in these communities.\"\n\nThe racial divides exposed in the police department's own data are a major factor in efforts to reform the police department. Yet policing experts and an analysis of the data also suggest that the CPD's own reports provide an incomplete picture of when officers use force.\n\nMultiple Justice Department investigations have uncovered serious underreporting of use of force in departments around the country, including in Cleveland , Seattle, and Baltimore . The department's review of the Newark Police Department found that officers did not fill out force reports in 30 percent of incidents in which they described themselves using force in another form.\n\nExperts agree that underreporting force is a concern. Walker warned that \"officers aren't necessarily either filing reports at all, or are filing reports that seriously misrepresent what happened.\" Philip Stinson , a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University, pointed out that uses of force involving arrests or serious injuries are harder to hide, since they usually require police to work alongside hospital or jail staff, but he added that when officers underreport or misrepresent their uses of force, \"it's not Taser stuff that I think is the stuff that they fudge, it's just the run-of-the-mill, routine police violence.\"\n\nChicago police officers nearly always arrest the people they use force on. Officers reported arresting a person after using force on them roughly 94 percent of the time.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nData from Chicago's stop-and-frisk program raises questions about the reported rate of use of force in cases without arrests. A 2015 survey of 1,450 Chicagoans, conducted by Northwestern University professor Wesley Skogan, found that 14 percent of African-Americans and 20 percent of Hispanics who were stopped and frisked but not arrested by Chicago police officers went on to report experiencing force, including being shoved or pushed around. In 2014 alone, internal CPD records , obtained by the nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs, show that the department stopped more than 445,000 African-Americans and more than 102,000 Hispanics who were not arrested. Projecting the rates from Skogan's study onto the CPD's data, that equates to roughly 62,000 stops involving African-Americans and 20,000 stops involving Hispanics where the police used some level of force. Although not all instances of shoving and pushing require an official use-of-force report, those figures are vastly higher than the CPD's force records. In all of 2014, Chicago police officers reported using force on about 170 African-Americans and 50 Hispanics who they did not arrest.\n\nThe proposed reform agreement between Emanuel and Madigan outlines major changes in the department's use-of-force reporting, requiring officers to report any force \"that is reasonably expected to cause pain or an injury,\" versus current rules that require reporting for clear injuries but not for causing pain. These changes would bring Chicago closer to other cities whose departments have undergone intensive reforms overseen by a judge.\n\nThe proposed reform plan also requires the department to audit its use-of-force reports for inaccuracies and to search for trends in the department's force data. The plan does not explicitly require the department to search for underreporting or missing use-of-force reports, beyond asking officers to notify a supervisor if a fellow officer does not file one.\n\nHarris argues that missing and inaccurate uses of force are a vital concern as Chicago tries to gauge the impact of a wide range of use-of-force reforms. \"It should be top of mind, absolutely top of mind in any agreement, and any agreement should include consideration of how well the current system is or is not working,\" Harris said.\n\nThe 2017 Justice Department report sharply criticized the Chicago police, calling out a \"culture in which officers expect to use force and never be carefully scrutinized about the propriety of that use.\" Now, as Chicago's leaders prepare to confront that entrenched police culture, they face not only the challenge of tackling the gaping racial disparities in CPD's reported use of force, but also the question of whether those reports even capture the true scope of force used by the department's officers.\n\nTop photo: This frame grab from police body cam video provided by the Chicago Police Department shows authorities trying to apprehend a suspect, center, who appeared to be armed, Saturday, July 14, 2018, in Chicago. The suspect was fatally shot by police during the confrontation.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Most High-Profile Al Qaeda Plot Foiled After 9/11 Was an FBI Scam\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new Frontline documentary details the case of the \"Liberty City Seven,\" a group of men the FBI coached into pledging allegiance to Al Qaeda.\n\nThe biggest Al Qaeda plot the FBI claimed to have foiled in the years following the 9/11 attacks involved no weapons, no plot, and no Al Qaeda. Instead, the vague, implausible threat by a group of construction workers in Florida to blow up U.S. buildings, including Chicago's Sears Tower, was mostly the making of the FBI, whose undercover operatives sought out the men, promised them money, and coached them over months to implicate themselves in a conspiracy to commit violent acts they never actually intended or had the means to carry out.\n\nThe \"Liberty City Seven\" case - known by its connection to the poor, violence-ridden Miami neighborhood where the men involved lived - was the most high-profile FBI investigation of a supposed terrorist cell after the attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. It came as the bureau, which had failed to act on intelligence it had received before 9/11, faced enormous pressure to predict and stop the next attack, setting off its transformation, in the words of former Deputy Director John Pistole, \"from reactive crime-solving agency to preventative national security agency.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe ordeal of the seven Black men, most of them Haitian American, who were manipulated by two paid FBI informants into pledging allegiance to Al Qaeda is recounted in a new Frontline documentary, \" In the Shadow of 9/11 ,\" by British director Dan Reed.\n\n\"It was kind of really absurd, almost unbelievable,\" said Reed, who has previously directed documentaries about terror attacks in Moscow and Mumbai . \"I didn't really understand how the Liberty City guys could have got themselves in this predicament.\"\n\nThe story of the seven men, five of whom were sentenced to a cumulative 43 years in federal prison in connection to the case, is a largely forgotten tale about the lengths to which government agencies were empowered to go in the panicked aftermath of 9/11 and about the absurdities the U.S. criminal justice apparatus sold to the public in the name of national security. The case is indicative of how quickly the so-called war on terror morphed into a battle to shape a narrative: that there was a real threat - and that the U.S. government was winning.\n\nThe case set the stage for hundreds of FBI sting operations in the following years, as the bureau continued to frame individuals who were often poor, credulous, and had dubious ability to independently plan any attacks. In doing so, the agency leaned on a sprawling surveillance apparatus set up after 9/11 and used constitutionally protected speech as a basis for monitoring people, even as bureau officials regularly denied doing so. FBI agents relied heavily on well-paid informants operating with little accountability. And they expanded the stings to an ever-growing list of supposed threats: not only foreign-inspired ideologies but also domestic ones , like that posed by what the FBI called \" black identity extremism .\"\n\nAs The Intercept has detailed in the \"Trial and Terror\" database, most of the nearly 1,000 people the U.S. has prosecuted for terrorism since 9/11 never came close to committing an act of violence. Like the Liberty City Seven, most had no connection to terrorist groups and many were set up in FBI stings.\n\nThose cases were not only unnecessary, colossal wastes of investigative and prosecutorial resources that destroyed people's lives, but they also distorted the American public's understanding of security threats after 9/11.\n\n\"What terrorists want to do is spread terror, they want to make people afraid that there will be more terror attacks,\" said Reed. \"And when the government goes in and essentially makes terrorists that way, then that's achieving the terrorists' aims. It's making the American public more afraid.\"\n\nThe story of the Liberty City Seven, pieced together in the documentary through interviews as well as hours of surveillance footage and audio recorded by the informants, is so tragic and farcical it is hard to fathom that it was a real FBI operation.\n\nThe supposed terror cell's ringleader, Narseal Batiste, was a construction business owner and eccentric spiritual guru with a small following of men faithful to the Moorish Science Temple of America, a mix of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam whose primary belief is the improvement of African Americans' condition. His associates were mostly poor, young men hustling on the streets of Miami. With Batiste self-styled as their \"divine leader,\" they mostly offered martial arts training and spiritual teachings to neighborhood kids.\n\nThe FBI learned of the group when a Yemeni convenience store clerk who had once worked as an informant for the New York Police Department claimed to the bureau that the group had asked him to make a connection with Al Qaeda. The tip seemed improbable even to the FBI, but the agency hired the clerk as an informant and concocted a scheme to introduce the group to yet another informant who claimed to be connected to Osama bin Laden. Batiste, who was struggling to pay off business-related debts, seized on what he thought was an opportunity to scam the two men out of money, which they kept promising while leading Batiste to make progressively more compromising statements of support for Al Qaeda. He played along.\n\nIn one of the exchanges that sealed his fate, Batiste agreed to provide one of the informants with a list of items he supposedly needed to carry out an attack in Chicago - including, for some reason, knee-high boots. \"I had to make up something up right then and there,\" says Batiste, whom FBI surveillance video shows struggling to differentiate a pistol from a machine gun before his unrelenting handler. \"I didn't know any names of guns. I had never owned a gun.\"\n\nPressed by the informants, Batiste repeated a bizarrely written oath of allegiance to Al Qaeda and, crucially, convinced his six associates to do so as well. Led on further, he made bombastic statements about a made-up plot to blow up buildings and shoot survivors, at one point boasting that it would be \"greater than 9/11.\" After yet more pressure, he agreed to drive around Miami, in a vehicle and with a camera the FBI had provided, to snap photos of federal buildings.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, Batiste believed that he was conning the FBI informants, who themselves were manufacturing a threat they knew was not real. The end goal for both parties was to cash in.\n\nNot even the FBI agents working with the informants to set up the sting believed that the threat was real, yet the Justice Department cited Batiste's \"overt acts\" to bring terrorism-related charges.\n\nThe Justice Department touted the case as a major victory in its newly launched war on terror, even as officials were aware that the seven \"weren't really the terrorists that we were seeking out,\" said Michael Mullaney, a former chief of the Justice Department's Counterterrorism Section, in the documentary.\n\nIt became apparent that the case was staged by the government as soon as the seven were arrested in June 2006. Justice Department officials tried to rationalize their decision to prosecute the men by insisting that they were guilty of the acts they were convicted of: swearing allegiance to a terrorist organization and taking photos of federal buildings. They justified stings as a tool to predict who might plot an attack, rather than traps set out for individuals who likely would have never thought to do so had the FBI not written the script for them.\n\n\"The problem with terrorism cases is you have to stop the act, and so you really in a way have to predict who is going to do what,\" said Mullaney. \"And so stings are very important.\"\n\nThe documentary, telling the story of a scam, seems to conclude that the victims are not just the seven men and their families but also the American people, whose government fabricated fear to justify its powers.\n\nThe film poster for \"In the Shadow of 9/11.\"\n\nIn the film, Mike German, a former FBI special agent who did undercover work for terrorism investigations before 9/11, says that had he told his superiors that he wanted to initiate an operation targeting individuals who did not belong to a terrorist group, did not have any weapons, and did not have a plot - and that the FBI itself would provide all those things in the course of the operation - \"they would have sent me for counseling.\"\n\nThe 9/11 attacks changed that, ushering in a \"no lead goes uncovered\" policy at the bureau that forced agents to pursue any tip that came in, no matter how far-fetched or improbable and regardless of the civil rights implications. That those tips often came from informants with clear financial agendas did not stop the bureau.\n\nIn the Liberty City case, the FBI went much further than checking out an unlikely tip. Even as the agents quickly realized that Batiste and the others posed no credible threat, they kept pushing forward, investing countless hours and resources into the sting. After the first trial ended with a hung jury, prosecutors tried it two more times before getting any convictions in 2009.\n\nThe operation became a cautionary tale within the bureau, which used it as a case study to train informants on how not to cross a line and to master the art of manipulation while steering clear of the legal threshold for entrapment. Rather than abandoning stings as pointless and harmful, however, the FBI doubled down on them, in some cases even providing weapons to the individuals they set up.\n\nTrevor Aaronson, a contributor to The Intercept and the author of a book about FBI stings, says in the documentary that the bureau's takeaway from the case seemed to be that \"if they can convict these guys in Miami, they convict just about anybody.\"\n\nIn the following years, the FBI did just that, prosecuting hundreds of people, including at least 350 who were set up in sting operations, mostly through paid informants.\n\nThe bureau manipulated a group of Black men in Newburgh, New York, to plant what they thought to be functioning bombs by two synagogues. In Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of Michael Brown led to widespread protests, federal agents framed two young protesters and coached them into a plan to blow up St. Louis's iconic Gateway Arch, before retroactively referring to their conviction to describe a new category of domestic extremism and expand surveillance of Black activists. At Standing Rock, the agency relied on an FBI informant who became romantically involved with an Indigenous activist and whose gun was used in what ended up becoming the most severe prosecution in connection to protests against the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\n\"I was hoping they would learn that this case\" - Liberty City - \"was an overreach, they had gone too far, and perhaps undermined public trust in the counterterrorism tactics that they were using,\" German says in the documentary, referring to the FBI. \"But they seem to have taken the opposite lesson.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Hillary Clinton Still Haunted by Discredited Rhetoric on \"Superpredators\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHillary Clinton is relying on support from black voters in South Carolina, but at a fundraiser in Charleston, she found herself confronted by a young black activist demanding an apology.\n\nHillary Clinton is relying on support from black voters to help her carry South Carolina in the Democratic primary on Saturday, but at a fundraiser in Charleston on Wednesday night, she found herself confronted by a young black activist demanding an apology.\n\nAs video of the protest shows, the activist, Ashley Williams , interrupted Clinton's remarks about criminal justice at the private event by unfurling a banner with the phrase \"we have to bring them to heel.\" Those words - language that has been taken as an offensive and racist characterization of young black teens as unruly animals - were used by the former first lady at a campaign rally for Bill Clinton in New Hampshire in January 1996.\n\nWilliams demanded that Clinton apologize for those words and for using racially charged language suggesting that the nation was threatened by a generation of young \"superpredators.\"\n\nAfter Clinton took note of the banner, Williams said, \"I'm not a superpredator, Hillary Clinton. Will you apologize to black people for mass incarceration?\"\n\nAs the small, mainly white crowd of donors hissed, and a man tried to get the activist to put her banner away, Clinton responded by referring to a speech she gave last April in which she deplored the killing of unarmed black men and boys by police officers and called for an \"end to the era of mass incarceration.\" Williams, however, pressed her demand for an apology, saying, \"You called black people predators.\"\n\nAs Williams was led away, Clinton claimed that this was the first time she had been asked to explain her 1996 comments, which have been widely shared online in recent months. \"You know what, nobody's ever asked me before, you're the first person that's ever asked me, and I'm happy to address it,\" she said.\n\nBut just seconds later, as the activist was bundled out the door, Clinton brushed off the exchange, saying, \"OK, back to the issues.\"\n\nVideo of the exchange, posted on a YouTube channel called #NotASuperpredator and featured on the Huffington Post , was viewed more than 100,000 times by Thursday afternoon, prompting the Clinton campaign to tell reporters that her words had been taken out of context, and referred not to at-risk, black teens, but to drug gangs exploiting kids.\n\nC-Span video of her speech on January 28, 1996, reveals that Clinton was indeed talking about the need to tackle gangs, but it is not hard to understand why activists like Williams might agree with Michelle Alexander, the author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , who called her language \" racially coded rhetoric \" in a widely read article in The Nation .\n\nTouting the success of the 1994 crime bill signed into law by her husband, Clinton said in the speech that in addition to putting more police officers on the streets:\n\nWe also have to have an organized effort against gangs, just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids who are called superpredators. No conscience. No empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel. And the president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere. In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.\n\nIn those remarks, Clinton appeared to endorse the subsequently discredited theory that American cities were threatened by a swelling wave of violent crime from a new generation of young \"superpredators.\"\n\nThat theory, as a New York Times video report shows, was eventually described as wrongheaded and destructive even by the political scientist most associated with the term, John J. DiIulio Jr. - but not before it helped justify a wave of harsh sentencing guidelines for juveniles across the country.\n\nLooking back at the superpredator panic of the 1990s two years ago in the Times , Clyde Haberman explained that it was based on flawed demographic research:\n\nWhat happened with the superpredator jeremiads is that they proved to be nonsense. They were based on a notion that there would be hordes upon hordes of depraved teenagers resorting to unspeakable brutality, not tethered by conscience. No one in the mid-1990s promoted this theory with greater zeal, or with broader acceptance, than John J. DiIulio Jr., then a political scientist at Princeton. Chaos was upon us, Mr. DiIulio proclaimed back then in scholarly articles and television interviews. The demographics, he said, were inexorable. Politicians from both major parties, though more so on the right, picked up the cry. Many news organizations pounced on these sensational predictions and ran with them like a punt returner finding daylight.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the apocalypse. Instead of exploding, violence by children sharply declined .\n\nOn Thursday, Clinton told Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post that, on reflection, she does now regret her choice of language. \"In that speech, I was talking about the impact violent crime and vicious drug cartels were having on communities across the country and the particular danger they posed to children and families,\" she said in a statement. \"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.\"\n\nAs our colleague Liliana Segura reported last year, the impact of the criminal justice legislation enacted during Bill Clinton's time in office is still being felt today by current and former juvenile inmates and their families.\n\nXavier McElrath-Bey, who grew up amid extreme poverty, abuse, and neglect, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison at the age of 13 for a gang-related murder on Chicago's South Side, told a conference in Dallas that children like him had been pathologized as intrinsically bad. \"We've come from a generation that they were saying were 'superpredators,'\" he said. \"They said that we were incorrigible, that we were beyond repair. They stated that we were godless, fatherless, heartless monsters. These were professors and researchers who fed the media the hype of an impending flood of juvenile crime that never actually occurred.\"\n\nLate Thursday, the activist who confronted Clinton posted a statement on Twitter rejecting the candidate's apology as insufficient.\n\nIn a video interview with USUncut , Williams told Nathan Wellman and Winnie Wong, a co-founder of People For Bernie, \"I wanted her to apologize to black people and other people of color who have been affected by mass incarceration in a very real material way. And I also wanted her to take responsibility for the ways in which she was complicit in those things.\"\n\nWilliams added that her doubts about Clinton were also motivated by \"inappropriate comments\" about President Obama \"being a black person running for President,\" during their battle for the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Kelley (Liveright, 2023).\n\nWhen sixteen-year-old Minnie Savage boarded a train from Lee Mont, Virginia, to Philadelphia in 1918 with nothing more than a sandwich, she told no one of her plans. The promise of jobs and opportunity in the North was too enticing. And the conditions in Accomack County, Virginia, were especially difficult for a young black girl. Only a few years earlier, in 1907, a white mob had attacked the town's African-American neighborhood after rumors of black laborers' plans to demand better pay from prosperous white farmers.\n\nSavage found work in Philadelphia. But the North had its own challenges, including many that resembled life in the Jim Crow South. Shut out of most jobs in the city, Savage was forced to toil as a cleaner at a local drugstore. The work was grueling. Each day, she scrubbed the floor of the drugstore on her hands and knees.\n\nSavage's experience mirrored those of millions of other black people who left the South during the Great Migration. One of those traveling to the North was Bruce Murphy, historian Blair L. M. Kelley's grandfather. He arrived in Philadelphia around 1918, also from Accomack County.\n\nWeaving in her family history, Kelley's Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class powerfully charts the course of the black working class from the era of slavery to the mid-twentieth century. While she acknowledges that no one book could capture the full depth and diversity of the black working class, Kelley's book is admirably sweeping in narrative and scope. By reclaiming the stories of black workers in the United States over centuries with richness and care, Kelley's Black Folk does justice to the memory and legacy of the countless black men and women who toiled in deplorable conditions to make a life for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nAnd as Kelley stresses, this is not solely a story about individual - or family - accomplishments. It is also a story about how the labor of black people - as workers and as freedom fighters - pushed the United States toward embracing democratic ideals. \"Their fights against racism and against labor exploitation,\" Kelley writes, \"were always one.\"\n\nKelley begins her narrative in the nineteenth century, when four million black people were enslaved in the United States. Through the life of her ancestor Henry Rucker, an enslaved blacksmith in Elbert County, Georgia, Kelley shows the significance of community formation as a survival tactic under a vicious system that denied black people's rights and personhood. As Kelley points out, these men and women found ways to sustain themselves by fashioning ties outside of the control of white slaveholders. During these years, Kelley argues, black people \"learned the basics of what it would be like to be part of a working class by earning at the margins of enslavement.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of slavery, black people were relegated to the most menial positions in US society. Sharecropping, which closely resembled slavery, left freed black men and women (as well as poor whites) in a seemingly never-ending cycle of debt and dependency. Laundry work - one of the most common occupations for black women, who made up 65 percent of the profession - was enormously taxing and poorly paid.\n\nYet black men and women resisted their exploitation, pushing for more autonomy and better conditions where they could. Kelley tells the story of Sarah Hill, a laundress living in Athens, Georgia, during the first half of the twentieth century, to highlight the important role of washerwomen in the years after the Civil War. Rather than submitting to demands that they work under supervision in white homes, black laundresses like Hill chose independence - they worked from their own homes, protecting them from further exploitation as well as the predations of white men.\n\nIn the most well-known act of resistance, black washerwomen joined together to contest working conditions and discrimination in Atlanta's 1881 washerwomen strike. In July of that year, twenty black women formed the Washing Society to advocate for better pay, respect, and less interference from white employers. The group quickly grew to over three thousand members with broad support among African Americans. The women maintained their solidarity in the face of arrests, reprisals, and attempts to break their control over the industry, demonstrating their ability to stand against municipal and business interests.\n\nKelley details other episodes in the long history of black working-class women's labor activism. She notes, for example, how black women joined other members of the working class in Richmond, Virginia, during a general strike in 1873. She details how African-American businesswoman and teacher Maggie Lena, a daughter of a washerwoman, organized a 1904 boycott there against segregated public transportation that \"bankrupted the city's main streetcar Cottrell Laurence Dellums company.\" Through these examples and many others, Kelley compellingly argues that black women have been key protagonists in the US working class.\n\nThe connection between black labor and the struggle for black citizenship rights is especially clear in Kelley's discussion of the Pullman porters. Recounting the story of, one of the organizers and leaders of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Kelley shows how the Great Migration was \"a search for everyday dignity.\"\n\nAfter almost losing a brother in the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, Dellums decided to relocate from Corsicana, Texas, to San Francisco in 1922 and search for job opportunities. On the way, he met a Pullman porter on the train west who counseled him to get off in Oakland and provided him with directions to a home where he could stay. After first finding work on a steamship, Dellums secured a position as a Pullman porter in January 1924. Three years later, he was fired by the Pullman Company for his support of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. This marked a turning point in his life: Dellums (the uncle of the late leftist congressman Ron Dellums ) soon became a full-time organizer for the union and ultimately a close ally of its leader, A. Philip Randolph.\n\nEstablished by Randolph in 1925, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was the first major twentieth-century union led by African Americans. Its members were workers at the Pullman Company, established by George Pullman in 1867. The nation's largest employer of African Americans, the Pullman Company maintained a racial hierarchy on passenger trains through a tiered labor force. White conductors were placed in positions of authority, while black porters provided service to passengers on the trains.\n\nThe Brotherhood challenged low wages as well as the dehumanizing working conditions of the porters. As Kelley explains, the efforts of Dellums, Randolph, and other porters not only paved the way for improved conditions at the Pullman company. They also helped to \"improve the lives of the Black working class writ large.\" What's more, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters played a central role in the creation of a national movement against racial oppression - best exemplified through A. Philip Randolph's leadership of the 1940s March on Washington Movement and porter E. D. Nixon's crucial organizing in the 1955-56 Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nKelley's discussion of the Pullman porters provides a window into some of the intricacies of the black working class. As she explains, the Pullman porters may have been more educated and better paid than many other black workers of the period. Many even saw them as part of the middle class. But the economic exploitation they endured on Pullman cars, tinged with racism, placed them squarely in the working class. Within the segregated communities of the North and South, Kelley makes clear, a materialist definition of class cannot be divorced from race. While Black Folk is about the working class, its subject is living, breathing people rather than abstract categories.\n\nShe goes one step further to suggest that we also cannot ignore gender. The black domestic workers and maids who take center stage in the book - largely absent from public discourse, despite representing two-thirds of black women's employment in the workforce in 1930 - were denied federal protections and shouldered the negative stereotypes directed at black families. Isolated from their families through live-in arrangements, black domestic workers were more susceptible to labor exploitation as well as sexual assault.\n\nYet black women found ways to band together - on their commutes, in what little leisure time they had, through childcare, and through clubs, churches, and unions. Motivated by the belief that \"a broken America could be made better,\" Kelley argues that these women negotiated for better conditions and \"used what they had to craft a vision of what a better life could look like.\" Black workers continually recreated the communal ties and organizing potential that sustained a culture of resistance.\n\nIn the final section of the book, Kelley turns her attention to black postal carriers. Examining the lives of Hartford Boykin, his father Isaac, and William Harvey Carney Jr, Kelley describes how federal positions opened for black Americans after the Civil War in recognition of their military service, but decades of racial violence and Jim Crow tyranny led to the relegation of black civic workers.\n\nBlack postal workers responded by creating the National Alliance of Postal Employees - first for railway postal workers in 1913 and later, in 1923, for all black postal workers. According to Kelley, this organization provided a base for black postal carriers \"to center the fights of laboring men and women in broad calls for justice.\" The union also lent them a layer of protection against economic retaliation, making it possible for African-American postal workers in the 1940s to help organize voter registration drives in Alabama and Georgia, and protest segregation.\n\nWith rich storytelling and innovative research, Black Folk refutes popular conceptions of the worker as universally white and male, elevating the lives of those too often ignored in media and politics. These individuals, Kelley asserts, represent \"the canary in the coal mine\" for the dehumanization of all laborers under capitalism, while also modeling resistance. Black workers built on the traditions of previous generations and banded together to improve social and economic conditions - not only for themselves and for their families, but for all workers across the country.\n\nKeisha N.

In order to understand America, \r\nwe have to understand the struggles of the black working class.\n\nAn African-American war worker in a munitions factory, circa 1940.\nHulton Archive / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn an important new book entitled Workers on Arrival , historian Joe William Trotter Jr charts the dynamic history of black workers in the United States, revealing how the labor of African Americans helped build the nation - and the world. His research highlights the unique challenges black workers have faced in the United States as well as their remarkable historical contributions.\n\nHistorian Keisha Blain recently spoke with Trotter about the \"golden age\" of the black artisan, the Great Migration's role in reshaping the black working class, the various ways that black workers helped construct American cities, the forms of discrimination African-American laborers faced at the hands of racist employers (and at times racist unions), the composition of the contemporary black working class, and much more. Their conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe timing of your book's release is especially significant as we reflect on the four-hundredth anniversary of the arrival of an estimated twenty Africans in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. And this is where your narrative begins - what you describe as the \"preindustrial beginnings\" of the black working class. Tell us more about how black workers helped to \"construct the colonial city.\"\n\nFrom the arrival of Europeans in North America, black workers, enslaved and free, helped build and maintain American cities as well as plantations and farms. They worked primarily as general laborers, household, and domestic servants. They not only helped clear land for both northern and southern cities, but also took a hand in the building and construction of early American cities themselves, including New York, Charleston, and New Orleans.\n\nEnslaved preindustrial black workers and gradually increasing numbers of free people of color not only worked as general laborers, household, and domestic servants, but also as skilled craftsmen and women: carpenters, brick masons, blacksmiths, tailors, and seamstresses, to name a few.\n\nIn New Orleans and elsewhere, they built housing frames, plastered walls, and shingled roofs. They also forged the tools that made the barrels that stored sugar, tobacco, and other staple crops. The products were also frequently carried to market in wagons and carts fashioned by the hands of enslave people. Enslaved blacks from Barbados not only helped to build Charleston through their labor and craftsmanship, but also influenced the wrought iron works and aesthetics of the city's architecture.\n\nSome scholars suggest that late colonial, revolutionary, and early America represented a kind of \"golden age\" of the black artisan. Slaveholders encouraged enslaved Africans to learn trades. The nation's leading newspapers regularly advertised for the purchase of enslaved craftsmen and skilled \"needle women.\" Preindustrial black artisans took pride in their specialized knowledge, expertise, and tools. Before the advent of woodworking machinery of various types, especially planing machines, African-American carpenters performed this work by hand much like their West African kinsmen.\n\nAs you point out in the book, the end of the Civil War radically transformed the experiences of the black working class, moving African Americans \"from a predominantly enslaved agricultural proletariat into a rural, sharecropping, and wage-earning working class.\" Tell us more about this process of proletarianization.\n\nThe war resulted in the emancipation of some four million enslaved men, women, and children. This set in motion the rise of a free black agricultural working class.\n\nSome historians call this early process a \"rehearsal for reconstruction\" and emancipation. But it was also a rehearsal for another era of proletarianization involving the widespread and forcible incorporation of previously enslaved agricultural workers into the free capitalist wage labor system. And while northern whites aimed to impose free market capitalist labor relations on the South, former slaveowners fought to imbue labor contracts with as many of the coercive features of enslavement as northerners would tolerate and African Americans would bear. Thus, the state facilitated the transformation of enslaved people into workers and slaveowners into employers on highly unequal terms, subverting the liberating and democratic potential of this new working class.\n\nDuring and following the Civil War, free blacks aspired to landownership over wage labor as the surest route to full freedom, citizenship rights, and empowerment. They believed that the capitalist, market-driven wage labor system deprived them of access to land and blocked their path to full emancipation. But the spread of unequal labor agreements, state-sanctioned violence, lynch law, and mob rule undercut their quest for landownership and set in motion a search for wage-earning jobs in the expanding rural industrial sector (coal mining, railroad building, and lumber works) as well as the industrial cities of the South, Northeast, and Midwest.\n\nTell us more about the impact of the Great Migration on the rise of the urban industrial black working class in the United States.\n\nThe Great Migration was deeply anchored in the volition, decision-making, and social struggles of Southern black workers. The numbers themselves are astounding. An estimated eight million African Americans moved from the rural and urban South to the North, West, and South from World War I through the mid-1970s.\n\nThe industrial sector offered a significant incentive to blacks in southern agriculture. African Americans who moved directly from a southern farm labor job to the urban North may have increased their earnings by as much as 300 percent in some cases. Even after adjustments for the higher cost of living in their new homes, a recent econometric study suggests that increases in migrant earnings ranged from a low of about 56 percent to a possible high of 130 percent.\n\nThe Great Migration not only helped fuel the transition of black men and increasing numbers of black women from general labor, household, and domestic service work into the higher paying manufacturing sector. The wages of massive numbers of black workers also enabled the rise of broader and more expansive African-American urban communities, described by some contemporary observers as the Black Metropolis , replete with an expanding range of institutions, including churches, fraternal orders, social clubs, and entrepreneurial pursuits.\n\nThe development of a black institutional infrastructure also underlay the rise of new forms of national and transnational social, political, civil, and human rights struggles that cut across class, ethnic, and racial lines. New social movements not only included organizations like the National Urban League and the NAACP but also the Garvey movement, the Communist Party, and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids. These dynamic political developments culminated in aggressive demands for full citizenship rights during the March on Washington movement during World War II and the rise of the modern black freedom struggle during the postwar years.\n\nOne of the central themes of your book is the role black workers played in helping build American cities. What do you see as the most significant contributions of black workers in some of the nation's largest cities, including Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Chicago?\n\nTheir impact was widespread. African Americans had their most profound impact on the development of the manufacturing, transportation, general labor, and household sectors of the urban industrial economy.\n\nIndustrialists trained their labor recruitment efforts on blacks in the Deep South states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York Central, the Illinois Central, and other railroad companies recruited black labor for a wide range of manufacturing companies as well as their own extensive rail operations. As a result, African Americans gained increasing access to jobs in the nation's railroad, shipbuilding, meatpacking , steel, rubber, and automobile manufacturing firms. By the end of World War II, although blacks continued to work disproportionately in household and general labor jobs compared to their white counterparts, nearly 75 percent of all African Americans, predominantly men, worked in nonfarm jobs defined as \"unskilled\" or \"skilled\" segments of the black working class.\n\nThe African-American impact on the city-building and work process varied somewhat from city to city. African-American labor fueled the development of the coal, iron, and steel industries of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Birmingham.\n\nThe impact of black workers was less pronounced on West Coast cities. Large numbers of Latino, Asian American, and Anglo workers vied for employment and upward mobility in western cities and created a more complicated urban working class. The West Coast's booming petroleum and movie industries excluded African Americans, while northern firms like Ford and Firestone opened West Coast branch plants in or near towns like West Gate in Los Angeles that openly excluded black residents. Still, during World War II, San Francisco Bay Area shipyards recruited increasing numbers of southern black men.\n\nBlack workers had their most profound impact on the shipyards in the city of Richmond, California. Within less than three years, partly through the massive migration of black workers to the Bay Area, Richmond mushroomed from a small quiet town of fewer than twenty-five thousand to a major industrial metropolis of one hundred thousand residents.\n\nAlthough your book highlights how black workers found spaces in which to create opportunities and thrive economically, it also addresses the many challenges they encountered. What do you see as the key historical roadblocks, on the local, national, and even international levels, that constrained black workers' lives and opportunities in the aftermath of slavery?\n\nAfrican Americans encountered several overlapping obstacles in their journey toward the urban industrial working class. These included the discriminatory hiring and promotion policies of large corporations like US Steel and the Ford Motor Company, the expansion of a racially exclusionary mainstream labor movement, and the crafting of a new white supremacist social order.\n\nMill foremen hired their own men, arranged levels of pay, and exercised control over firing. Black workers labored almost exclusively in the cellar of steel, meatpacking, automobile, and other manufacturing plants. Employers across industries would often remark, as one automaker put it, to paraphrase, \"we hired you for the hot and dirty work and want you to stay there.\" Some companies refused to hire blacks at all.\n\nThrough the interwar years, leading Philadelphia firms like the Budd Company, Bendix, Cramps Shipyard, and Baldwin Locomotive excluded African Americans from all categories of work, from the bottom to the top of its workforce. Blacks faced even greater inequality in Birmingham, Durham, Memphis, and other cities of the industrial South. In Memphis and Houston, when employers classified African Americans performing identical work as whites as \"helpers,\" they paid them uniformly lower wages than their white fellow workers. While some black men gained appointments as sub-foremen over all-black work crews, they were almost never given supervisory positions over white workers or even mixed gangs of black and white employees.\n\nIn general, the urban West and southwest presented a more complicated racial and ethnic environment than the urban North and South. In West Coast cities, African Americans worked with rising numbers of Asian, Latino/Latina Americans and immigrants, and competition for available work was sometimes quite fierce. But the racial rather than ethnic stratification of work presented the greatest obstacles to the city's black workers. These intertwined developments were reinforced by mob violence, the police power of the state, and by popular pseudo-scientific notions about the genetic inferiority of people of African descent.\n\nWhat unique challenges did black women workers encounter during the twentieth century? What kinds of strategies did these women employ to resist racial and gender oppression? To what extent were these efforts successful?\n\nMost African-American women continued to work, largely in household service occupations. Their employment supplemented the seasonal and often inadequate earnings of black male industrial workers. At the same time, rather than withdrawing from the workforce, black women themselves gradually moved into manufacturing jobs across urban industrial America, including iron, steel, meatpacking, and automobile factories, and auto parts plants and machine shops. Detroit's A. Krolik Garment Company not only hired its first black women, but soon developed an all-black female workforce. In Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania domestic and personal service workers dropped only slightly, but a few black women nonetheless became power-machine operators at the National Shirt Factory and took other jobs at the Lockhart Iron and Steel Company.\n\nAfrican-American women used industrial work not only as an alternative to domestic service work, but also as a mechanism for bidding up the price of their labor in household employment. Some of these women adopted the motto, \"W. W. T. K. (White Women to the Kitchen)\" and urged their sisters to leave domestic service employment for new manufacturing jobs.\n\nWomen occupied an even broader range of manufacturing jobs in the South than in the urban industrial North and West. In Durham, North Carolina and Memphis, Tennessee, nearly 50 percent of black women workers took jobs in the manufacturing sector of the economy, particularly tobacco , clothing, and food production. Many of these women were hired in accord with racial stereotypes that they were physically as strong as men and could endure more heat than their white female counterparts.\n\nIn Houston, African-American women examined bales of cotton in the city's cotton compresses and warehouses. Although they were industrial workers, they were called \"cotton pickers\" because they removed dirty or bad cotton from the good cotton and helped prepare it for market. But they also earned the lowest pay of all compress employees.\n\nThe precarious place of black women in the urban industrial economy also reinforced their ties to the informal urban economy, including the sex trade. Most of these women pursued their trade inside \"houses of prostitution,\" run by other women rather than on the streets. But the growing policing, arrest, and harassment of black women in the sex trade added another highly gendered component to the coercive dimensions of the proletarianization process. Thus, similar to African-American men, black women occupied the cellar of the industrial workforce.\n\nOne of the important themes you address in Workers on Arrival is the varied roles of labor unions in shaping the experiences of black workers in the United States during the twentieth century. Can you tell us more about the ways labor unions were helpful, and sometimes harmful, to the organizing efforts of black workers?\n\nLabor union discrimination against black workers emanated most pointedly from the skilled craft unions of the American Federation of Labor and the Railway Brotherhoods. Even when unions included nondiscrimination clauses in their constitutions, they often formed racially segregated locals and retained the color line in union practices.\n\nIn 1917, when meatpacking workers formed the Chicago Stockyards Labor Council, the union enacted a nondiscrimination membership policy, but quickly established two racially segregated locals on the city's South Side - one for black men and the other for black women. More damaging, however, the SLC admitted constituent locals that restricted membership to white men and sometimes to white men and women. These included the machinists, the Railway Carmen's union, and the electrical workers, blacksmiths, and other craft unions.\n\nThe Great Depression and Roosevelt's New Deal labor legislation helped to change the racial landscape of the American labor movement. An influential cluster of black organizers emerged among all the major Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) unions, including the Packinghouse Workers Organizing Committee, the United Automobile Workers, and the new Steel Workers Organizing Committee. African-American organizers helped bring black workers from the periphery into the center of the industrial labor movement. Covering black and white workers alike, the new contracts established formal grievance procedures to govern a broad range of day-to-day workplace issues. The agreements also brought black workers into the seniority system, which would help alter the entrenched system of arbitrary color-based hiring and firing decisions.\n\nBy the end of World War II, African Americans had become part of a large multiracial US labor movement nationwide. However, even as they deepened ties with the interracial CIO unions, they also organized their own independent Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Maids. Under the leadership of civil rights and labor activist A. Philip Randolph, the union waged and won a concerted fight to gain admission to the racially exclusionary American Federation of Labor.\n\nBut it was a bittersweet victory. Despite heavy reliance on the women's auxiliary to achieve both union recognition and a contract with the Pullman Company, the Brotherhood dropped maids from its name and excluded women from the provisions of its contract with Pullman. Black women would face an uphill climb in both interracial and independent labor organizations.\n\nHow has globalization and deindustrialization altered the experiences of black workers in the United States?\n\nThe precipitous loss of urban manufacturing jobs deprived black workers of their most dynamic base of economic opportunity and upward mobility during the industrial era. The disappearance of mass-production manufacturing jobs accelerated disproportionately high African-American unemployment rates and the spread of poverty. The collapse of the industrial economy intensified suffering across nearly every category of African-American life - jobs, health care, housing, education, access to police protection, and equal justice before the law, to name a few.\n\nBlack workers found new jobs opening up in distant almost exclusively white suburban and rural communities far from the inner city, where poor and working-class blacks were hampered by a lack of adequate private automobile and public transportation to new job sites. Poverty rates not only escalated behind rising unemployment statistics, but became more spatially concentrated in urban public housing projects than before.\n\nHow would you summarize the state of the black working class today? What do you see as the greatest challenges facing black workers in the twenty-first century? What, if anything, is improving?\n\nAs in the past, people of African descent continue to contribute to the development of American society through their labor. Whereas the bulk of industrial-era blacks contributed to the growth and expansion of the United States as the world's leading manufacturer of durable goods, the black working class today is finding its footing in the lower rungs of the food, health care, household service, transportation, and other human service industries of the digital age.\n\nBlack working people are by no means occupying the bottom rungs of today's evolving transnational economy quietly. Labor organizing remains one strategy for improving working conditions. As manufacturing and other jobs dissipated, the balance of power within the labor movement shifted from the old blue-collar industrial, construction, and transport unions to new service and public sector unions, including the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). In 2007, thirteen local domestic workers' organizations formed the National Domestic Workers Alliance and launched a spirited campaign to establish national and \"global standards for household labor.\"\n\nSeveral developments distinguish the current moment in black labor history from the industrial era. During the era of the Great Migration blacks moved almost uniformly from South to the urban North and West. Beginning during the 1970s, the great northward migration of black workers came to an end as growing numbers of black people moved back to the South and Southwest. While significant numbers of Caribbean and to some extent continental African people moved to the United States during the Great Migration, recent immigrants of color make up a growing proportion of the African-American population, with significant implications for reshaping the cultural and political contours of the new digital-age black working class. Immigrants or children of immigrants make up one-tenth of all African Americans, but in New York City they make up nearly 50 percent of the African-American population.\n\nFinally, the mass incarceration of young black men and women represents the most important challenge facing the black working class moving forward. As legal scholar Michelle Alexander made clear nearly a decade ago, the label \"felon\" stands as a nearly impenetrable wall separating large numbers of poor and working-class blacks and other people of color from the perquisites of US citizenship in the postindustrial age.\n\nJoe William Trotter, Jr is a professor of history and social justice and the director and founder of the Center for African-American Urban Studies and the Economy (CAUSE) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Norton, 2021) and The First Reconstruction : Black Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War , by Van Gosse (UNC Press, 2021).\n\nAfter the Civil War, Republican lawmakers pushed through a series of amendments to the US Constitution abolishing involuntary servitude, establishing birthright citizenship, and protecting the voting rights of black men, including the newly freed. What black and white Republicans accomplished during the early years of Reconstruction amounted to nothing less than a \"second founding,\" in the words of the great historian Eric Foner , remaking the Constitution and, along with it, the very relationship between citizens and their government.\n\nBut accepting the unprecedented novelty of emancipation and Reconstruction in the 1860s at face value requires making two additional assumptions with far-reaching implications. The first is that slavery in the United States only ended during the Civil War; the second is that black men had been universally excluded from political participation from the nation's founding.\n\nThough seldom acknowledged, these assumptions hew closely to Chief Justice Roger B. Taney's infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 , which effectively nullified the free status of black people throughout the country, regarded black chattel slavery as an unalterable fact based on the determinative category of race, and denied that any black person had ever been - or could ever be - a citizen. Free and enslaved African Americans may have influenced antislavery politics and the growing abolitionist movement but, the story goes, they did so as outsiders until abolition in 1865 and the advent of formal black citizenship at the national level in 1868.\n\nTwo recent books by preeminent historians upend these conventional understandings. Kate Masur's Until Justice Be Done explores the jagged roads to the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth Amendment (which established birthright citizenship) and argues that these national charters of black citizenship were not products of \"emergency lawmaking,\" but rather the fruits of decades of interracial political organizing against racist laws in the North and the nation at large.\n\nVan Gosse's The First Reconstruction shows that well before the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting, black men in various northern states held, lost, and regained the franchise. Any discussion of politics in the antebellum North, he argues, must account for the \"extensive participation\" of African-American men in \"seeking electoral influence over or within the state.\"\n\nTogether, both works reveal that it was in the so-called free states of the North during the half-century following independence that Americans first grappled with the explosive question of black citizenship rights within a post-slavery society - a question that reemerged with full force during the Civil War.\n\nGosse and Masur ground their studies in the first great wave of abolition by northern state lawmakers and judges. Beginning with Vermont in 1777 and Pennsylvania in 1780, and concluding with New Jersey in 1804, northern states passed gradual emancipation laws to erode the legal basis for slavery that had pervaded every American colony. In 1787, the Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the present-day Midwest but also included a fugitive slave clause that made it something less than free soil.\n\nThe early republic was a centrifuge machine, spinning slavery's center of gravity southward. But slavery's borders were extraordinarily porous, and its politics national in scope.\n\nThe midwestern states are key battlegrounds in Masur's book, for it was there that the prohibition of slavery invited other systems of racial control. Ohio's earliest legislators feared their state would become a beacon to any free blacks expelled from the neighboring slave states of Virginia and Kentucky. To discourage black migration, Ohio relied on its extensive police powers to pass a series of Black Laws during its 1803-4 legislative session, anticipating in many ways the Black Codes of the post-Civil War South.\n\nThough it hardly stopped black migration, Ohio's Black Laws made it extraordinarily difficult for black migrants to qualify for official residency, or \"legal settlement,\" thereby disqualifying them from public relief and rendering them vulnerable to eviction should they upset the \"public order.\" Fears about crime, dependency, and poverty among free blacks suffused the non-slaveholding North.\n\nDown South, slave states like South Carolina invoked their police powers when defending laws aimed at imprisoning free black sailors who disembarked in their ports. Massachusetts lawmakers took the lead in demanding nationwide protection of the rights of its black citizens when traveling and working in other states and the District of Columbia. Black sailors in Boston and their allies - including eminent abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, William Cooper Nell, and Charles Lenox Remond - petitioned Congress for protection against the South's \"unjust and unconstitutional statutes.\"\n\nOthers joined the fight. In New York City in 1839, the black abolitionist William P. Powell organized a boardinghouse for African-American sailors. Many had been \"arrested and thrust into lonesome prisons and dungeons\" while working in places such as Georgia and South Carolina, all without any alleged charges \"except that of our complexion.\" In 1842, Powell helped gather signatures from two hundred twenty \"free Coloured citizens of the United States and State of New York\" demanding Congress protect their constitutional rights and livelihoods.\n\nIn the early republic, Americans generally derived their legal status from states and localities, not the federal government. But few states managed to clearly define the boundaries of citizenship. As Masur notes, many states began to distinguish between civil rights - the most basic protections of life, liberty, and property - and political rights, such as the right to vote, hold office, or serve on a jury.\n\nThe campaign for black civil rights, Masur suggests, was \"the movement's lowest common denominator.\" In Ohio, as in other midwestern states, abolitionists in the 1830s made repealing the Black Laws and protecting civil rights for free African Americans central to their political agenda. They pressured the two establishment parties - the Whigs and the Democrats - which were both inclined to suppress the divisive slavery issue and support the racist residency laws as integral to the public order. Anti-racist activists also inundated legislatures with petitions, exacted pledges from candidates, built dissident political parties, and forged coalitions.\n\nThe Liberty Party figures prominently in Masur's story. An insurgent third party that arose around 1840, it was dedicated not only to abolishing slavery, but also promoting racial equality before the law, including the right to vote. Often dismissed as a preordained failure, the party made impressive gains at the state and local level. But even more important, its candidates polarized the two major parties, forcing Whigs and Democrats to clarify their stances on black civil rights. Libertyites drew many dissidents into their fold as they sought the balance of power.\n\nAfter its apogee in 1844, the Liberty Party bowed to another insurgent group, the Free Soil Party, which united the various antislavery dissident factions of the northern states against the Slave Power. \"The Free Soil Party was larger and more diverse than the Liberty Party,\" Masur concedes, \"and its stance on racial equality before the law was more opaque.\" Nationally, the Free Soil platform of 1848 remained silent on black civil and political rights. But at the state level, many Free Soilers remained true to the old Liberty Party's mission and continued to press for the repeal of racist laws still in effect in many northern states.\n\nThe following decade was a moment of profound political realignment. The Whig Party broke down, and the existing party system collapsed. The slavery issue rent the American social fabric apart, opening up new possibilities for mobilizing broad antislavery forces (who could seemingly agree on little else but its non-extension westward).\n\nMasur's great contribution is to situate the crucial issue of civil rights organizing in the North at the center of the familiar story of the 1850s. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 did more than shore up the national reach of the Slave Power; it also forced a reckoning with the legal status of free black people in the northern states.\n\nThe twin issues of slavery and black citizenship roiled the United States in the 1850s. A series of blatantly proslavery acts and Supreme Court decisions assaulted the rights of African Americans, and increasingly militant black abolitionists hit back. Yet, as Gosse painstakingly details in The First Reconstruction , black men did not act solely as political outsiders, disenfranchised agitators, or fugitive slave rebels. Since the Founding, African-American men had exercised their right to citizenship, including by - when and where they could - voting.\n\nLike Masur, Gosse trains his focus on state and local politics, rejecting the impulse to regard the \"free North\" as diametrically opposed to the \"slave South.\" Although a tide of free black disenfranchisement swelled after the Revolution - beginning with Maryland (1783) and Delaware (1787) and continuing through Tennessee, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania (mid-1830s) - Gosse argues that black men's \"electoral weight expanded in those states where they maintained the franchise,\" including much of New England, New York, and Ohio. Together with the curious case of Pennsylvania - where a substantial portion of the black elite in Philadelphia retreated into what Gosse calls \"shadow politics\" and acquiesced to disenfranchisement in 1838 - these four political arenas formed the staging ground for the so-called first Reconstruction.\n\nGosse treats black voting \"as a political fact rather than a lost opportunity or future possibility\" - and, importantly, as a \"collective practice\" of building a \"black-and-white partisanship.\" Unfortunately, excluded from the story are the black women who exerted considerable (if unquantifiable) influence on the abolition and women's suffrage movements and the partisan activities of black men - as they would during the \"second\" Reconstruction of the 1860s. Yet Gosse still does something revelatory: he has excavated the widespread engagement of black men in the electoral sphere.\n\nThe first Reconstruction began in New England. What Gosse calls a \"nonracial Yankee Republic\" coalesced in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine following the Bay State's affirmation of black citizenship in 1780. In these states political parties routinely competed for the votes of black Yankees.\n\nThis was especially true in New Bedford, the city (once home to Frederick Douglass) with the most robust tradition of black electoralism and officeholding. There, black men organized as an independent voting bloc and skillfully moved between Whigs, Democrats, Libertyites, and Free Soilers before finally becoming Republican.\n\nIn other port cities - Portland and Providence, for example - black Yankees enjoyed so much electoral influence and patronage within the Whig Party that they rebuffed entreaties from the Liberty Party when it swept across New England, baffling the insurgent party's abolitionist leaders. \"Most Afro-Yankees were Whigs,\" Gosse argues, because they understood the importance of belonging to the ruling group - of being \"in the state, not outside it. That the Whigs were hardly antislavery at the national level,\" he continues, \"was secondary when 'the States' mattered as much as the Union and local Whigs were firmly antislavery.\"\n\nGosse finds the most influential African-American constituency in New York. Bolstered by its gradual emancipation initiative in 1799, by 1820 the Empire State's free black population grew to such an extent that it stood poised to change the composition of government. With total abolition set for 1827, an estimated 11,488 black men, both free and adult, would be added to the voting rolls. It was in this context that Martin Van Buren led the effort at the 1821 state convention to universally enfranchise white men and disenfranchise black men by including a \"freehold\" requirement - owning $250 in property - which effectively stripped most black New Yorkers of the vote.\n\nGosse regards this maneuver as a turning point in American politics. Van Buren, soon to join Andrew Jackson's presidential ticket, sought to build a national party favorable to southern slaveholding interests - which meant subordinating the growing black electorate. Van Buren's New York was thus the bellwether of Jacksonian Democracy.\n\nNot to be cowed, black New Yorkers built a statewide apparatus to lobby for full re-enfranchisement in the 1830s and 1840s. They variously allied with the left wing of the Whig Party (represented by William Henry Seward and Thurlow Weed) and the insurgent Liberty Party (and its wealthy abolitionist benefactor, Gerrit Smith). Though contingently disenfranchised, black New Yorkers had both parties competing for their votes in an increasing number of cities and towns across the state. Their suffrage campaign suffered a crushing defeat at a statewide convention in 1846, but by then many African-American voters had been able to meet or bypass the 1821 freehold requirement.\n\nIn the 1840s, the black electorate - led by an impressive cohort of nationally renowned black leaders - enjoyed a range of political vehicles for their advancement: Seward's Whig Party, Smith's Liberty Party, and the Free Soil Party. By the mid-1850s, most black New Yorkers had thrown their support behind the most logical choice, the freshly formed antislavery Republican Party. Two black men, Stephen Myers (a former slave) and William J. Watkins (an itinerant organizer), proved to be especially keen political operators. They led the New York State Suffrage Association, which urged black voters to back the Republican ticket and helped secure equal suffrage in an 1860 referendum.\n\nOhio witnessed the most impressive mobilization for black civil rights. Though shackled by a legally subordinated status, free blacks continued migrating to Ohio, doubling the size of their community over the 1830s. Black Ohioans achieved a remarkably united front and wielded surprising electoral strength - securing a repeal of several key Black Laws in 1849 and transforming the state into a hotbed of political abolitionism. Black leaders, such as the Oberlin-educated John Mercer Langston, made their mark in the state. And Ohio decisively shaped the political vision of abolitionist politicians such as Salmon P. Chase, who would achieve national prominence at the helm of the antislavery Republican Party during the Civil War and Reconstruction.\n\nThe First Reconstruction and Until Justice Be Done are timely interventions for our own historical moment. The long history of racism in America has not faced such popular scrutiny since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.\n\nBut, as historian Matt Karp has recently observed , the new historicism is ill-equipped to appreciate the collective struggles of the past. From the birth of \"whiteness studies\" in the 1990s to the 1619 Project today, many scholars and journalists have sought to invert the mawkishly patriotic narrative of American exceptionalism and steady progress by casting light on its photo negative: a monolithically and irrevocably racist nation. In this telling, even the antislavery movement that precipitated the Civil War and the destruction of the slave regime appears as nothing more than a stalking horse for a new white supremacist order.\n\nNeither formulation - Whiggish or whiteness - can account for what Kate Masur and Van Gosse describe in their books - a sustained, multigenerational struggle against not only human bondage but also the policies that codified racial inequality and exploitation. Despite the retrenchment of southern slavery, the onslaught of Jacksonian-style herrenvolk democracy, and the rise of Jim Crow-style policies in the antebellum North, black and white activists mobilized in staggering numbers and in countless places to challenge - and at times overturn - racist laws by sheer political force. Appreciating this serrated, kaleidoscopic history requires an awareness of both the agency of historical actors and the malign forces of accumulated wealth and power they were up against decades before the abandonment of Reconstruction.\n\nThat many such forces persist today makes the anti-racist struggles of the past all the more relevant. Among the most urgent issues in contemporary US politics is the concerted Republican effort to disenfranchise voters, predominantly voters of color. Since January, hundreds of laws have appeared in state legislatures - many in battleground states - that restrict voting access, from ID laws to intentionally burdensome registration requirements.\n\nVoter disenfranchisement has historically emerged from calculations of partisan advantage. But, as these two histories suggest, so too have efforts to expand the electorate. Antebellum lobbying efforts by would-be black voters and allies yielded historic victories at the state level from New England to Ohio. Not incidentally, they benefited the party willing to fight for the nonracial franchise. All the while, the electorate-constricting forces slung the familiar accusations of voter fraud, charging widespread instances of black men voting illegally in New York or even enslaved men voting in Ohio in numbers large enough to sway elections.\n\nThe disenfranchisers' response, then as now, has been to reform (read: purge) the voting rolls to supposedly preserve democracy. As historian Julilly Kohler-Hausmann has recently argued , \"Countering these charges will take more than pointing out the lack of evidence of voter fraud or introducing harsher penalties. It will require undermining the racially stratified notions of citizenship that such claims rest upon - and looking beyond electoral reform to the greater democratization of public life.\"\n\nIt will require, in other words, a broad-based, daring, politically dexterous movement, live to alliances with insurgent politicians and parties - a movement that collectively exerts pressure at all levels of government by mobilizing across the social strata. If we can accomplish that, we might finally heed the lessons from the civil rights struggles of the first Black Reconstruction.\n\nDale Kretz is an assistant professor of African American history at Texas Tech University.

And he had braved the 1875 Clinton Massacre , where nearly sixty people were slaughtered and another thirty injured, following a rally and picnic for Reconstruction-era black politicians in Mississippi.\n\nNow, with white elites inflamed at his sharecropper organizing, Cromwell again found himself in peril. Death threats, both verbal and printed, poured in. Backing up Cromwell, seventy-five armed representatives of the Colored Alliance delivered their own message : they would not be intimidated, had power in numbers, and were military trained.\n\nThe act of defiance and solidarity was not enough, however. Mobs of white men from throughout the region descended upon the town in search of black farmers, with little attention given to whether the people they were attacking were even members of the Colored Alliance. The governor called in the National Guard, but they quickly dispersed as the mob grew out of control. By the time the deadly attacks came to an end, over twenty black citizens had lost their lives, with some reports claiming the number was closer to two hundred.\n\nAlthough short-lived and little-known today, the Colored Farmers' Alliance and similar groups in the late 1800s made up the largest black political movement in the South before the modern civil rights movement. Black populism not only helped pave the way for later resistance among black sharecroppers, farmers, and other agrarian workers, but tilled the soil for a sustained mass black politics and the dreams of an alternative to a racist, plutocratic system.\n\nThe Colored Farmers' Alliance was established in 1886 in Houston County, Texas, by sixteen black men on the farm of Richard M. Humphrey, a white Baptist minister and former Confederate soldier. Although membership was limited to African Americans, Humphrey was elected a superintendent and spokesperson of the Colored Alliance and was able to address the group's concerns to white audiences without the same threat of retaliation. Black leaders joining Humphrey at the helm included J. J. Shuffer, president, and H. J. Spencer, secretary.\n\nThe Colored Alliance's primary mission was to give black farmers the tools to fight not only falling commodity prices, high interest rates, and rising supply costs, but also discriminatory practices by white landowners and business owners. Across the New South, black organizing was being met with mob violence. To protect themselves, the group's charter specified that they would operate as a secret organization with passwords, much as black fraternal organizations did. They also noted that they would operate separately from the National Farmers' Alliance, which excluded African Americans from the membership rolls.\n\nThe Colored Alliance trained members in economic and political governance, promoted character-building programs, supported mutual aid in their community, argued for more schools for African American children, agitated for more humane treatment of black convict farm laborers, and taught members about their civil rights. They flexed their collective buying power, operating exchanges in Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charleston, South Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; and Norfolk, Virginia. The upstart group even started their own newspaper in 1889 to coordinate efforts and communicate across state lines.\n\nWithin a few short years - thanks to existing networks of black churches and fraternal organizations, aligned unions like the Colored Agricultural Wheel, and the tenacity of state organizers like Cromwell in Mississippi, Ben Patterson in Tennessee, and Rev. W. A. Pattillo in North Carolina - the Colored Alliance boasted more than one million members, although that figure was likely inflated. While no membership or institutional records remain, Humphrey claimed that Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas all had between ninety thousand and one hundred thousand Colored Alliance members, with other southern states reporting sizable amounts just under that. In Texas alone, fifty-six counties had Colored Alliance charters, with reportedly thousands of subchapters.\n\nWhile Colored Alliance members and National Farmers' Alliance members had different and sometimes conflicting goals (many more in the white Farmers' Alliance, particularly leaders, owned land and employed farmhands), the two at times worked together. White alliance leaders joined the annual convening of delegates of the Colored Alliance in St Louis in 1889 and again in Ocala, Florida, in 1890. North Carolina's Pattillo noted that members of both alliances helped him clandestinely recruit black farmers to the Colored Alliance.\n\nThe groups also worked across racial and state lines to participate in a boycott of jute - which was used to wrap bales of cotton - beginning in 1888. A couple years later in Louisiana, white and black alliance members banded together against the state lottery program, which they saw as a mutual threat to poor farmers enticed by get-rich-quick schemes.\n\nStill, National Farmers' Alliance leaders refused to budge on their policy of racial exclusion, stating they were \"in favor of equal and exact justice to all men, regardless of race, color or previous condition,\" but that they wanted \"all colored organizations to have their own State and national organizations, as well as their own schools and churches and separate hotels and railroad accommodations.\"\n\nAs the Colored Farmers' Alliance gained converts in droves, another agrarian organization with a similar name, the National Colored Alliance , was also flourishing in the South, claiming 250,000 members of its own. The two groups were plagued by disagreements that \" divided our churches . . . embittered our communities and created discord in our families.\" Although there was brief talk in 1890 of merging the organizations , leadership disagreements about how and when to strike burned any bridge under construction.\n\nIn 1891, at the peak of its membership, the Colored Alliance attempted to organize a cotton pickers' strike to earn better prices for their crops. If landowners could conspire together to keep prices low, sharecroppers reasoned that they, too, could band together and demand one dollar per one hundred pounds of cotton. Although the pending strike was widely publicized, and the union's membership was reportedly large, when the planned date of September 12 came and went, only Texas saw any action.\n\nBy the end of the month, however, violence would erupt again one hundred miles north of Leflore in Lee County, Arkansas. There, in the heat of the Arkansas Delta, a man named Ben Patterson had been organizing black cotton pickers. He managed to organize dozens of men to press for 75 cents per pound. (It is unclear if Patterson had any direct affiliation with the Colored Alliance or the earlier planned strike.)\n\nAgain, those in power responded with violence. Angry white mobs attacked the strikers, with fifteen black lives lost in the attacks and another nine imprisoned. Of the fifteen, nine had been captured by the mob from police custody and lynched. An Arkansas Gazette, headline from October 2, 1891, read, \" Nine Negroes Lynched: The Lee County Trouble Settled With Rope .\" One white plantation superintendent also died.\n\nThe Colored Alliance never recovered.\n\nAround the same time, a union for white farmers called the Agricultural Wheel again raised hope of interracial cooperation.\n\nOrganized near Des Arc, Arkansas, in 1882, the group's mission resembled many other farmers' aid organizations at the time, including the Colored Alliance. It supported cooperative buying and selling, breaking up monopolies, establishing a railroad commission, and the education of the masses.\n\nAcceptance of black farmers into the Wheel's ranks varied from location to location. Black Wheelers had success organizing in St Francis County, Arkansas, despite violent retaliation, and in Tennessee and elsewhere black farmers started an entirely independent offshoot of their own called the Colored Agricultural Wheel .\n\nElsewhere, bigotry prevailed over class politics: Wheelers from states like Arkansas and Kentucky fought vehemently against the removal of the word \"white\" from the Agricultural Wheel's requirements and bylaws that same year. In 1887, the Wheel merged with an organization called Brothers of Freedom that barred black farmers from membership and announced plans for a consolidation meeting with the Southern Alliance, which limited membership to \"white persons over sixteen years old engaged in agriculture and related pursuits.\"\n\nWhile any hope of organizational cooperation dissipated, in Arkansas, white Agricultural Wheel members (mostly former Democrats) and Colored Agricultural Wheel leaders (all erstwhile Republican Party supporters) joined forces to attack the Democratic ruling class with the short-lived Arkansas Union Labor Party . Although they only participated in two election cycles, in 1888 and 1890, the labor party's victories marked the only time the state's Democratic-dominated system faced serious opposition at the polls. Baptist minister G. W. Lowe, president of the Arkansas State Colored Agricultural Wheel, served in the state legislature in 1891, as did many other African Americans at the local level.\n\nRuling-class Democrats had seen enough. They passed laws to disfranchise Arkansas's poor black and white voters in 1891, and in 1892, a new state poll tax sealed the deal. Southern elites elsewhere used the same formula. They were terrified of the organizing progress that the masses had made, even if on slightly separate and somewhat segregated trajectories.\n\nIn a bid to decisively stamp out class politics and any whiff of cross-racial solidarity, those in power enacted Jim Crow laws to stifle any challenge to the plutocratic order. When laws were not enough, violence and intimidation at the polls and elsewhere helped keep poor workers divided and white supremacy strong.\n\nAlthough violence against African Americans had been mounting in the years after Reconstruction, the 1890s saw new levels of racist terror and political oppression. Between 1890 and 1905 , every single state in the South approved literacy and poll tax laws and officially segregated its public facilities. Lynchings became nightmarishly common. And organizing workers grew harder and harder.\n\nColored Alliance members were just one group of Southern black laborers who endured violence in those post-Reconstruction years. A group in South Carolina called the Co-operative Workers of America , which sought to eliminate the dependence of rural black workers on rural merchants and company stores, was hit with ferocious attacks in 1887. That same year, a strike organized by the Knights of Labor and black sugar plantation workers in Louisiana was met with deadly violence, with over sixty losing their lives in what would become known as the Thibodaux Massacre .\n\nThese violent acts were a brutal response to the economic, political, and social power that black citizens had managed to accumulate. Between Reconstruction and 1890, the total amount of land owned by African Americans tripled. Literacy and school enrollment expanded dramatically, and black Republicans won and held political seats across the South thanks in part to black voters.\n\nGroups like the Colored Alliance and other black farmers' collectives, while perhaps unsuccessful in their immediate goals, helped build opposition to plantation Democrats via third-party politics, chipped away at the oppressive agrarian economy, and served as a practice run for future moments of black and interracial farmer resistance, including the 1930s Southern Tenant Farmers Union.\n\nBlack populism may have been written out of the history books. But in its day, it was a mighty force.\n\nKaren Sieber is a public historian and digital humanist specializing in riots and resistance and social justice history. She is best known for her work on the Red Summer, the Tulsa massacre, and the Loray Mill strike of 1929.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Michael Rogers\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of many of the most significant events of the Black Freedom Struggle of the 1960s. Two years ago, we celebrated the March on Washington; last year we recognized the 1964 Civil Rights Act that ended Jim Crow apartheid in the South. This year, we have already seen commemorations of the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, and summer's end will see the fiftieth anniversary of the Watts Rebellion in Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, the country had seen rebellions in Rochester, New York; Philadelphia; and Trenton, New Jersey, to a name a few cities, in 1964, but up to that point, Watts was unprecedented in its scale, damage, deaths, and sheer ferocity in the summer of 1965. The uprising in South Central Los Angeles represented a stark conclusion to the nonviolent phase of the movement.\n\nThe acrid plumes of smoke that hung over the city of Baltimore are a stark reminder of the recent past of the 1960s. But the riots over the death of twenty-five-year-old Freddie Gray seen in Baltimore last week aren't simply a replay of events that took place fifty years ago.\n\nThe inequities that ignited hundreds of American cities in the 1960s still exist and have, in fact, deepened over the last half century. Then as now, pervasive police violence and harassment defines the humiliation and powerlessness of life for millions of working-class and poor African Americans.\n\nBut what makes the Baltimore uprising different from an earlier era is that the vicious attacks on African Americans have unfolded at a time of unprecedented black political power.\n\nFewer than forty miles from Baltimore, in the nation's capital, resides the nation's first African-American president. There are forty-three black members of Congress and two senators - the highest number of black Congress members in American history. And just as the West Side of Baltimore was erupting against the police killing of Freddie Gray, Loretta Lynch became the first black woman appointed as attorney general.\n\nThis isn't only a national phenomenon; it's also reflected in local politics. In Baltimore, African Americans control virtually the entire political apparatus.\n\nMayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Police Commissioner Anthony Batts have been the most prominent faces of political power in Baltimore over the last several weeks. But Baltimore's city council has fifteen members, and a majority - eight - are African American, including its president. The superintendent of the public schools and the entire board of the city's housing commission are African American. Across the United States, thousands of black elected officials are governing many of the nation's cities and suburbs.\n\nIn this respect, the events in Baltimore are dissimilar from what happened in Ferguson, Missouri last summer. There, the small suburb just north of St Louis had a majority black population largely governed by a white suburban government, and the lack of black political power and representation became a narrative thread in popular explanations for what went wrong. Electing African Americans into political office in Ferguson thus became a focal point for many local and national activists.\n\nBut if the murder of Mike Brown and the rebellion in Ferguson was reminiscent of the old Jim Crow, then the murder of Freddie Gray and the Baltimore uprising is symbolic of the new black power.\n\nIn fact, pursuit of black electoral power became one of the principal strategies that emerged from the Black Power era. At the end of the 1960s, the calls for \"community control\" over the cities that black people lived in became louder. Such calls made sense: the \"Great Migration\" brought millions of African Americans into the nation's cities and helped to elevate black concerns into political discussion (though they were rarely acted upon) and transformed many metropolitan demographics as blacks moved in and whites moved out.\n\nWhite political control of increasingly black cities exacerbated existing tensions over those cities' conditions. In cities like Chicago, the patronage machine could draw in some black participation, but that hardly resembled any real black political or economic control of the city's infrastructure. The destruction and instability caused by urban rebellions over the course of the decade advanced the idea among elites that perhaps more black control and ownership within the cities might help to calm the rebellious black population.\n\nToday, we have more black elected officials in the United States than at any point in American history. Yet for the vast majority of black people, life has changed very little. Black elected officials have largely governed in the same way as their white counterparts, reflecting all of the racism, corruption, and policies favoring the wealthy seen throughout mainstream politics.\n\nBaltimore is a telltale example. Mayor Rawlings-Blake may be African American, but under her leadership, large swaths of black Baltimore have remained poor, unemployed, and perpetually harassed and abused by the police.\n\nIn the last four years alone, more than one hundred people have won civil suits against police brutality. During Rawlings-Blake's tenure, the city has been forced to pay $5.7 million to settle civil suits regarding police misconduct and brutality - an amount that does not include the $5.8 million Baltimore has paid to defend police who have abused the black public.\n\nDespite the lawlessness of the Baltimore Police Department, the mayor reserved her harshest comments for those involved in the uprising, describing them as \"criminals\" and \" thugs .\" For anyone remotely aware of Rawlings-Blake's mayoral history, her lashing out at the victims of police corruption and brutality would not have been surprising.\n\nEven though unwarranted police attacks had been widely documented and adjudicated, a month prior to the unrest in Baltimore, the mayor blamed black men for violence in Baltimore. Invoking her inner Rudy Giuliani, Rawlings-Blake said of violence in the city: \"Too many of us in the black community have become complacent about black-on-black crime. ...While many of us are willing to march and protest and become active in the face of police misconduct, many of us turn a blind eye when it's us killing us.\"\n\nIgnoring the long history of racism and the epidemic of police terrorism in shaping black life in Baltimore, the mayor, as has become typical of the black political elite, blamed the problems of the city on the African Americans who live there.\n\nThe major difference between life in cities like Baltimore today and fifty years ago is not only the existence of a black political stratum that governs and manages much of black America, but also the ways this powerful black political class helps to deflect a serious interrogation of structural inequality and institutional racism. Instead, leaders from that political class resurrect old and convenient narratives that indict black families and culture as the central explanation for persistent racial inequality.\n\nTo maintain legitimacy within the Democratic Party, which most of these black politicians consider home, they toe the party line that emphasizes personal responsibility and rejects raising taxes to fund desperately needed social programs.\n\nAnd black elected officials either create or widen the space for whites to interrogate the moral habits of ordinary black people. When President Obama, Mayor Rawlings-Blake, and Attorney General Lynch refer to black protestors as \"thugs\" and \"criminals,\" white Republicans do not have to.\n\nBlack elected officials often invoke a sense of racial solidarity, familiarity, and insight into the lives of the black poor and working class - only to then chastise or blame ordinary African Americans for deteriorating conditions in their own neighborhoods.\n\nThis is not just a product of contempt for the black poor, but also the result of the pressures of governing big cities in an age of austerity. Cities have been thrust into competition with each other to attract capital, resulting in a race to the bottom to cut taxes and essentially shove out those in need of social services.\n\nFocusing on individual failure and lapsed morality (rather than structural inequities) justifies the budget cuts and shrinking of the public sphere that these black political elites are charged with carrying out. What African Americans in cities around the country need, according to this narrative, is personal transformation, not expanded social services.\n\nBlack political operatives operate in the same terrain as their white competitors. They compete to stay in the good graces of wealthy donors while maximizing political connections to bolster their campaign war chests. They, too, rely on aggressive policing to make up for the social problems created when poverty, gutted social services, and no prospects for success in American society converge and eventually combust .\n\nThe uprising in Baltimore has crystalized the deepening political and class divide in black America. This is a new development in the black freedom struggle that historically has been united across class lines to fight racism.\n\nFrom the White House to city halls across the country, the growth and maturation of the black political class has firmly placed them in a position of managing the crises that continue to unfold in black neighborhoods across the country. Black political operatives have no better solutions for ordinary African Americans than any other elected officials.\n\nIn Ferguson and now in Baltimore, it's the movement in the streets that is bringing global attention to the racism and inequality that still thrives in American society - not black faces in high places.\n\nKeeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is an assistant professor in Princeton University's Department of African American Studies.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Blair LM Kelley's Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class is a necessary corrective - and provides lessons for struggle today.\n\nA black picketer walks through an all-white train car in Chicago during the United Packinghouse Workers of America strike of 1948.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class by Blair LM Kelley (Norton, 2023).\n\nFlorida's new history curriculum, generated in the wake of Governor Ron DeSantis's \"Stop WOKE Act\" and approved earlier this summer, will teach students that the institution of American slavery provided some benefit to enslaved workers by giving them valuable skills. While it's true that newly freed peoples entered the economy with skills learned on plantations, it is also true that a violently enforced racial hierarchy demanded these skills be put to use for the ultimate benefit of the white economic elite. A rapacious industrial capitalist class awaited these new wage laborers, ready to take full advantage. Freed black men and women relied on interdependent networks of mutual aid, education, and labor organizing to leverage their skills into decent jobs where possible. The effort to do so, spanning a century and a half and still ongoing, is the story of the black working class.\n\nThis history of black labor struggle is obscured in the dominant account of the black American experience. Slavery is about corporeal brutality, Reconstruction about statehouses, Redemption about burning crosses, Jim Crow about water fountains, the civil rights movement about firehoses - all of it true enough, but conspicuously none of it about work. And yet work is always in the background, from the fundamentally unfree labor compact called slavery to Martin Luther King Jr's final speech to striking sanitation workers in Memphis the night before his assassination. It's this suppressed labor history that author Blair LM Kelley attempts to reclaim with care and compassion in her new book Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class .\n\nWhen we picture the working class, we typically conjure images of white coal miners with their faces made black by the indiscriminate application of coal dust. Or perhaps we think of industrial factory skeletons in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania - and we imagine that the workers who made a decent living in them were all white, even though many were black. Everyone colludes in this whitewashing of the working class. The conservative image of the working class is presented as mostly white, mostly male, and in opposition to the struggle for racial justice. Meanwhile, in liberal spaces the working class is largely seen as mostly white, mostly male, and an unfortunate collateral casualty of trade deals and technological advances.\n\nLurking just beneath the surface is the distinction between what we consider legitimate work and what we see as labor fit only for the least of us. After the Civil War, the vast majority of work available to black people was either domestic or agricultural in nature - labor that was and still is viewed as unskilled and beneath the dignity of even the white working class. The idea that a factory worker is a working-class person while a farm laborer is not is an illusion. It has its origin in the history of the black working class, even as it works to convince us that no such thing ever existed.\n\nConversations today about the value of labor in our increasingly service-oriented economy are informed by a long history of devaluing the work performed by formerly enslaved people and their descendants. Black Folk takes particular care to describe working lives of laundresses, maids, farmers and fieldhands, porters and mail carriers - work that does not immediately come to mind when imagining the halcyon industrial period of growth and the American middle class but were no less vital to its construction. The history that Kelley provides here should be at the front of anyone's mind when talking about the value of restaurant workers, Uber drivers, delivery drivers, and Amazon warehouse workers. We are all living with the legacy of the denial of the black working class.\n\nWhile campaigning for president in Salt Lake City, Governor DeSantis responded to the criticism of his state school board's new black history curriculum by saying that what the textbooks are \"probably going to show is some of the folks that eventually parlayed being a blacksmith into doing things later, later in life.\"\n\nOne of the subjects of Black Folk is Henry, an ancestor of Kelley's who was indeed an enslaved blacksmith, freed following the Civil War. However, while the skills that Henry earned while held hostage on the plantation were absolutely necessary to the agrarian economy of his home in Elbert County, Georgia, white farmers, businessmen, and lawmakers were not in any rush to pay him fairly for his talents. As Kelley interweaves her account of her ancestor's life with the story of how the integrated Reconstruction government of Georgia was hijacked and removed by a movement of indignant racists, it becomes clear that Henry's postslavery life was made tenable not by the value his skills provided but through networks of black solidarity.\n\nAs Kelley's book demonstrates, these networks were born in the backwoods of antebellum plantations as slaves sought community and opportunities for religious worship hidden from the paranoid eyes of their white slavers. They took a more visible form after slavery ended with the formal institution of the black church. Black churches were more than just places of rest and worship - they were centers of political organization and mutual aid. They were the beneficiaries and guardians of a tradition of interdependence and community that provided a kind of cultural instinct for later generations of black workers to rely on as they fought for their skills and labor to be compensated. Much of Black Folk is focused on the relationship between these networks and the growth of black labor power.\n\nAnother story recounted in the book is that of black washerwomen earning a meager living working for white households. It's unlikely that Florida's school board is thinking of laundry as one of those valuable skills imparted to black people in the course of their brutal subjugation - but nevertheless, in the decades following emancipation, washing clothes did take skill, hard work, and more importantly was a task relegated to women and refused by many white women, making it primarily a black women's trade.\n\nBlack workers and women workers both earned less than their white and male counterparts, and domestic work was compensated accordingly. Even sixty years after slavery ended, Essence magazine described a scene where black women lined up in an open-air market to be hired as domestic workers : it \"resembled a slave auction with the prospective buyers looking over the workers like so many head of cattle; looking for the strongest and sturdiest.\"\n\nIn the postslavery South, black washerwomen began to organize networks where they could share information about potential jobs and which employers paid low wages or were abusive. As the level of organization increased, Kelley shows, it allowed them to withhold their labor in order to secure fair pay and decent treatment. In Atlanta they were able to leverage the value of their labor through a strike.\n\nThe response to this preunion black labor solidarity sounds eerily familiar today, with white newspapers and politicians breathlessly declaring that these black women \"didn't want to work anymore.\" The leaders of the Atlanta washerwomen's strike were arrested and jailed on specious fraud charges - that is, punished for their insubordination and resistance to the established postslavery order. (Currently, activists against Atlanta's \"Cop City\" are being punished in a similar manner for raising bail funds to stop a police militarization project - a contemporary version of the solidarity networks of old.)\n\nUltimately, while free black people did possess the skills and the work ethic that allowed America to become an industrial and economic superpower, that fact was never enough to outweigh the white ruling class's entitlement to the fruits of their labor.\n\nKelley structures Black Folk around the personal stories of black workers who lived through slavery, Reconstruction, and the industrial revolution. These individual histories are presented not as singular tales of personal fortitude, but as emblematic of a larger culture of communal survival and collective labor struggle that buoyed the fight for black liberation.\n\nThere is a version of black history that traces the advancement black Americans through the lens of individual successes - the professionals, politicians, businessmen, and other members of the \"talented tenth,\" almost all men, who charted their own path to the middle and upper classes. This version peddles the fiction of black self-sufficiency. In truth there was never any such thing, including for the breakout individuals; wherever a black person secured a decent standard of living - whether as a doctor, a postman, or a washerwoman - there have always been networks dedicated to mutual aid and collective struggle. Black folks didn't survive the period following slavery through individual effort and the skills benevolently taught at the end of the lash, but by relying on each other and understanding the power of solidarity.\n\nLabor struggle is seldom discussed when talking about black history and the fight for equal rights. And yet it is a tradition that lives on in the fight to unionize Amazon warehouses, win fair contracts for UPS drivers, and fully fund public schools so they can adequately support teachers, students, and working-class families. The tradition lives on in the community networks that formed in response to both the urban violence that flowed from black poverty and the violence against black people perpetrated by police . It can still be found in the black church, but now also in secular mutual aid organizations. It is a tradition that proves that class struggle cannot be meaningfully separated from the story of racial justice.\n\nKelley's Black Folk is a love letter to the long-overlooked black working class. It's also a call for everyone, regardless of their race, to return to that tradition in the face of racial oppression and economic exploitation today.\n\nAkil Vicks works in clinical research and is a member of River Valley Democratic Socialists of America.

Du Bois's magnum opus, Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880 , published in 1935, is one of the greatest scholarly studies of revolution and counterrevolution. It deserves a place on one's bookshelf next to other modern classics, including Leon Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution , C. L. R. James's The Black Jacobins , Georges Lefebvre's The Coming of the French Revolution , and Karl Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte . Scholars of revolutions, unfortunately, have not usually considered the US Civil War to be one of the great social revolutions of the modern era, akin to the French, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. Many readers, in fact, view Du Bois's book much more narrowly, as a response to white-supremacist histories of the Reconstruction era (1865-1876) and, more particularly, a defense of the role of African-American politicians - and the black voters who elected them - in the Southern state governments of that time. Du Bois does present such a defense, but Black Reconstruction offers much, much more than this.\n\nBlack Reconstruction is not only a towering work of history but also a work firmly embedded in the Marxist tradition. Du Bois reinterprets the Civil War as a social and political revolution \"from below\" - a workers' revolution - that brought about the overthrow of both slavery and the Confederate state, thereby opening a door to interracial democracy in the South. The book then reinterprets the subsequent overthrow of this democracy as a class-based counterrevolution that destroyed the possibility of freedom for half the Southern working class and imposed a \"dictatorship of capital\" that brought about \"an exploitation of labor unparalleled in modern times.\"\n\nBut why should one read Black Reconstruction in the twenty-first century? In short, because Du Bois is writing about issues that remain of tremendous political importance, including the nature of racial oppression and the racism of white workers. Unlike most contemporary analysts of race, moreover, Du Bois approaches these issues from the perspective of political economy. He rejects an approach to racial oppression that starts with prejudice, discrimination, or culture, trying instead to dig beneath these and understand how they are rooted in the material interests of different classes. Instead of insisting on the separation of race from class, as so many liberals do, Du Bois insists on their intimate connection .\n\nBlack Reconstruction is rightly famous for stressing the collective agency of enslaved people in winning their own freedom and for its impassioned rebuttal of racist historiography. What has been less emphasized is the way in which Du Bois very explicitly rejects analyses of the Civil War and Reconstruction that emphasize race and racism as the primary drivers of historical events. Racism certainly played a hugely important role in that era, Du Bois argues, but it was a product of - and usually disguised - another, more powerful force: capitalism. More specifically, Du Bois argues in Black Reconstruction that two characteristic features of capitalism - capitalists' competition for labor and workers' competition for jobs - are the root cause of conflicts that seem to be driven by racism.\n\nThis perspective on Du Bois's masterpiece runs counter to some influential interpretations of his work. Not surprisingly, there is resistance in some quarters to stating plainly that Black Reconstruction is a work of Marxism. Many people who come to Black Reconstruction for the first time are not expecting to read a Marxist text. They have most likely read Du Bois's earlier collection of essays, The Souls of Black Folk , which precedes his turn to Marxism by three decades. While a number of authors do recognize Du Bois's Marxism , many others deny that Black Reconstruction or his subsequent writings are Marxist. In 1983, for example, Cedric Robinson described Du Bois as a \"sympathetic critic of Marxism.\" Gerald Horne's 1986 book examines in great detail Du Bois's involvement in leftist (mainly Communist) causes after World War II, but he never offers an opinion as to whether Du Bois was a Marxist. (More recently, however, Horne has emphasized the Marxist character of Black Reconstruction .) And Manning Marable's book on Du Bois, published just a few months later, portrays him as a \"radical democrat\" - although Marable later suggested that Du Bois might usefully be viewed as part of the \"Western Marxist\" tradition.\n\nMore recently, a group of \"Du Boisian\" sociologists recognizes that Du Bois integrates some elements of Marxist thinking into his worldview. But according to these writers, not only is Du Bois not a Marxist but his ideas clearly transcend Marx's. Marx gave theoretical primacy to class, they say, whereas Du Bois grasped the \"intersectionality\" of class and race, emphasizing their connections while giving theoretical primacy, by implication, to neither. According to these writers, this theoretical move allowed Du Bois, unlike Marx and his followers, they claim , to understand colonialism, the ways in which race \"fractures\" class consciousness, and racial oppression generally.\n\nIn this essay, I argue that these \"Du Boisians\" and others who deny Du Bois's Marxism are wrong. Du Bois actually does give theoretical primacy to capitalism. In both Black Reconstruction and his subsequent writings, Du Bois repeatedly emphasizes how racial oppression is a product of capitalism. Time and again, furthermore, Du Bois takes issue with what we would today call \"race reductionism,\" that is, attempts to explain historical events primarily in terms of race. His rejection of race reductionism only deepened in the years after Black Reconstruction 's publication.\n\nAfter 1935, in short, \"Du Boisianism\" is Marxism. Du Bois's failure lay not in the fact that he embraced a Marxist orientation but that he came to uncritically support Soviet authoritarianism. This was perhaps the greatest tragedy, in my view, of Du Bois's long life. But the main point of this essay is to show that, despite all efforts to ignore or deny his Marxism, Black Reconstruction stands as a brilliant work of class analysis.\n\nDu Bois's turn toward Marxism occurred rather late in his life, shortly before the publication of Black Reconstruction . His trip to the Soviet Union in 1926, months before Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power, certainly pushed him in this direction. \"Never before in life,\" writes his biographer David Levering Lewis, \"had he been as stirred as he would be by two months in Russia.\" Du Bois traveled more than two thousand miles across the Soviet Union, \"finding everywhere . . . signs of a new egalitarian social order that until then he had only dreamt might be possible.\" \"I may be partially deceived and half-informed,\" Du Bois wrote at the time. \"But if what I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my ears in Russia is Bolshevism, I am a Bolshevik.\" (Du Bois would visit the Soviet Union again in 1936, 1949, and 1958.)\n\nDu Bois later wrote that his trip to the Soviet Union led him to question \"our American Negro belief that the right to vote would give us work and decent wage\" or would abolish illiteracy or \"decrease our sickness and crime.\" Only a revolution, by implication, could attain these ends. Du Bois also now believed that \"letting a few of our capitalists share with whites in the exploitation of our masses, would never be a solution of our problem.\" Black liberation was impossible, in sum, so long as the United States remained a capitalist society, and \"black capitalism\" was a dead end.\n\nDu Bois had been broadly familiar with Marxist ideas since his graduate student days at Harvard and in Berlin. But it was not until 1933, in the midst of the greatest crisis of capitalism in world history, that Du Bois began conscientiously to study Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. He was then sixty-five years old. As Lewis writes, Du Bois fell hard for Marxist analysis:\n\nLike so many intellectuals in the thirties who broadcast Marxism as a verifiable science of society, the Atlanta professor was mesmerized by dialectical materialism. Calling Marx the \"greatest figure in the science of modern industry,\" Du Bois seemed to rediscover with the avidity of a gifted graduate student the thinker who Frank Taussing, his Harvard economics professor, had smugly ignored. Marx made history make sense - or more sense, Du Bois came to believe, than all other analytical systems.\n\nDu Bois was prodded to master Marxist theory by the rise of a group of so-called Young Turks within the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the civil rights organization he helped found. These young scholar-activists , including Abram Harris, Ralph Bunche, and E. Franklin Frazier (all members or soon-to-be members of the Howard University faculty) \"were attempting to shift the Negro intelligentsia's focus on race to an analysis of the economics of class.\" All were convinced that a powerful interracial labor movement was necessary to smash racial oppression, and they were critical of the NAACP for its lack of an economic program. Members of this group would offer advice to Du Bois about which texts were essential for him to read. Harris's book, The Black Worker: The Negro and the Labor Movement , coauthored with Sterling Spero, proved particularly influential; it was no coincidence that Du Bois titled the first chapter of Black Reconstruction \"The Black Worker.\" (I discuss the precise significance of this below.)\n\nAlthough he would later grow close to the pro-Soviet Communist Party, Du Bois's guides to Marxist theory in the early 1930s also included two anti-Stalinist leftists. One was Benjamin Stolberg, a journalist who later served on the Dewey Commission (officially the Commission of Inquiry Into the Charges Made Against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials), which was named after its chairman, the philosopher John Dewey. The other was a young leftist by the name of Will Herberg. Herberg was a Jewish Russian immigrant who flunked out of the City College of New York, joined the Communist Party, and was expelled along with others associated with Jay Lovestone for opposing Stalin's foreign policy at the time. The Lovestonites, however, were ardent defenders of the Soviet Union. Herberg brought Marx's writings on the Civil War to Du Bois's attention, as well as Herberg's own Marxist pamphlet on the Civil War and Reconstruction, \"The Heritage of the Civil War,\" which Du Bois would quote and cite in Black Reconstruction .\n\nDu Bois takes up a great many issues in Black Reconstruction , but the book mainly attempts to answer three broad questions: First, how did the Civil War become a revolution that overthrew slavery and brought democracy to the South? Second, what were the nature and main achievements of the Reconstruction state governments in the South? Finally, how are we to understand the counterrevolution that overthrew democracy and brought about a kind of semislavery for Southern blacks?\n\nThe opening chapters of Black Reconstruction are not about Reconstruction at all. They deal with the antebellum period, workers (white and black), the nature of slavery, and the Civil War. These chapters make many important arguments and claims, none more important than the idea that enslaved people freed themselves during the Civil War through an extensive and prolonged \"general strike.\" This strike, like all strikes, was an instance of class struggle that involved the withholding of labor by one class of people, the workers or \"direct producers,\" from the owning or ruling class. As in other great revolutions , the opportunity for this class struggle from below was created by interelite conflicts that erupted into war .\n\nDu Bois insists that \"slave workers\" (as he calls them) should be seen as an integral part of the interracial working class in America, not as a group set apart by separate and distinct interests. It was the tragic error of Northern workers and the Northern labor movement - and an error of subsequent analysts who are blind to class - not to comprehend this. Thus, Du Bois titles the first chapter of his book \"The Black Worker,\" not \"The Black Slave\" or \"The Enslaved.\" And the second chapter is called \"The White Worker.\" Of course, Du Bois is keenly aware of the difference between enslaved labor and free wage labor. \"No matter how degraded the factory hand,\" he writes, \"he is not real estate.\" But Du Bois wants to emphasize, in Marxian fashion, that these two groups of workers, despite their different circumstances and despite their racial difference, share the same basic material interests. This was true, moreover, both before and after the Civil War.\n\nBut white workers failed to see their common interests with slave workers. \"White labor,\" writes Du Bois, \"while it attempted no denial but even expressed faint sympathy, saw in [the] fugitive slave and in the millions of slaves behind him, willing and eager to work for less than current wage, competition for their own jobs.\" It was this competition for jobs that fueled white racism. However, \"What [the white workers] failed to comprehend,\" writes Du Bois, \"was that the black man enslaved was an even more formidable and fatal competitor than the black man free.\"\n\nThere thus arose, Du Bois relates, not one but two labor movements in antebellum America, one to free the slave workers of the South and the other to improve the wages and working conditions of the mainly immigrant working class in the North. The union of these two movements, Du Bois points out, would have been \"irresistible.\" But it was \"almost impossible,\" he writes, for white labor leaders to understand this:\n\nThey had their particularistic grievances and one of these was the competition of free Negro labor. Beyond this they could easily vision a new and tremendous competition of black workers after all the slaves became free. What they did not see nor understand was that this competition was present and would continue and would be emphasized if the Negro continued as a slave worker.\n\nThis explains why white workers kept their distance from the abolitionist movement, which, for its part, failed to \"realize the plight of the white laborer, especially the semi-skilled and unskilled worker.\" This division within the US working class, of course, weakened both labor movements.\n\nThe general strike during the Civil War took the form of slave workers fleeing the plantations for the front lines and encampments of the Union Army. Du Bois estimates that five hundred thousand of the South's four million enslaved blacks fled the plantations. These families and individuals typically worked on behalf of the Union Army as long as the war lasted; eventually, some two hundred thousand were armed and fought for the Union against the Confederacy. The general strike was thus a double blow to the South: the withdrawal of labor disrupted and weakened the Southern economy and war effort - cotton production in particular declined precipitously - and the labor made available to the Union Army strengthened the North's military might. \"Without the military help of the black freedmen,\" Du Bois argues, quoting no less an authority than Abraham Lincoln, \"the war against the South could not have been won.\"\n\nDu Bois points out that this general strike \"was followed by the disaffection of the poor whites,\" who saw \"with anger that the big slaveholders were escaping military service; that it was a 'rich man's war and the poor man's fight.'\" The exemption from military service of men who owned twenty or more slave workers was galling, \"and the wholesale withdrawal of the slaveholding class from actual fighting which this rule made possible, gave rise to intense and growing dissatisfaction.\" Du Bois also notes the poor whites' \"fear and jealousy of Negroes\" in the advancing Northern army: \"If the Negro was to be free where would the poor white be? Why should he fight against the blacks and his victorious friends? The poor white not only began to desert and run away; but thousands followed the Negro into the Northern camps.\" In 1864 alone, according to Du Bois, one hundred thousand poor whites deserted the Confederate Army.\n\nWhere does racism fit into Du Bois's analysis of slavery? His discussion of racism in the antebellum period is classically materialist: racism did not produce slavery; slavery produced, and continuously reproduced, racism. The planters' need for cheap labor - and the extraordinary wealth it produced - was its root cause. Slaveowners could not increase the productivity of their plantations by giving more resources to slave workers, or educating them, or teaching them skills, as this would undermine the very institution. Due to competition with other planters, moreover, the slaveowner \"was forced, unless willing to take lower profits, continually to beat down the cost of his slave labor.\" In this context, racism was \"found, invented and proved\" in order to justify the horrors (and inefficiencies) of slavery. This is how Du Bois puts it:\n\nIf the leaders of the South, while keeping the consumer in mind, had turned more thoughtfully to the problem of the American producer, and had guided the production of cotton and food so as to take every advantage of new machinery and modern methods in agriculture, they might have moved forward with manufacture and been able to secure an approximately large amount of profit. . . . But in order to maintain its income without sacrifice or exertion, the South fell back on a doctrine of racial differences which it asserted made higher intelligence and increased efficiency impossible for Negro labor. Wishing such an excuse for lazy indulgence, the planter easily found, invented and proved it. His subservient religious leaders reverted to the \"Curse of Canaan\"; his pseudo-scientists gathered and supplemented all available doctrines of race inferiority; his scattered schools and pedantic periodicals repeated these legends, until for the average planter born after 1840 it was impossible not to believe that all valid laws in psychology, economics and politics stopped with the Negro race.\n\n\"The espousal of the doctrine of Negro inferiority by the South,\" Du Bois concludes, \"was primarily because of economic motives and the interconnected political urge necessary to support slave industry.\" (Du Bois has more to say about the racism of white workers, which I examine below.)\n\nDu Bois's explanation of the Union's victory in the Civil War also highlights the efforts of English workers to prevent their government from recognizing the Confederacy and entering the war against the Union. \"Monster meetings\" of workers in London and Manchester in 1863 had a real impact, in Du Bois's estimation. \"Karl Marx,\" he writes, \"testified that this meeting [in St. James' Hall, London, in March 1863] . . . kept Lord Palmerston [the prime minister] from declaring war against the United States.\" Du Bois quotes the text of a speech, written by Marx, which was read at a subsequent demonstration in London, a text addressed and sent to President Lincoln :\n\nSir: We who offer this address are Englishmen and workingmen. We prize as our dearest inheritance, bought for us by the blood of our fathers, the liberty we enjoy - the liberty of free labor on a free soil. . . . We rejoiced, sir, in your election to the Presidency, as a splendid proof that the principles of universal freedom and equality were rising to the ascendant. We regarded with abhorrence the conspiracy and rebellion by which it was sought at once to overthrow the supremacy of a government based upon the most popular suffrage in the world, and to perpetuate the hateful inequalities of race.\n\nThese English workers embraced just the type of interracial working-class solidarity that Du Bois would come to see, seventy years later, as essential for the eradication of racial oppression and for the liberation of workers of all colors.\n\nThe slave workers' general strike destroyed slavery directly but also indirectly, by inducing Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. It also proved decisive for the Union defeat of the Confederacy. The result was thus a social as well as a political revolution. With the eradication of personal servitude, democracy became, for the first time, a real possibility in the South. Along with Du Bois, accordingly, we have every right to consider the Civil War truly epochal: \"Its issue has vitally affected the course of human progress. To the student of history it ranks along with the conquests of Alexander; the incursions of the Barbarians; the Crusades; the discovery of America, and the American Revolution.\" For Du Bois, \"the emancipation of the laboring class in half the nation [is] a revolution comparable to the upheavals in France in the past, and in Russia, Spain, India and China today.\"\n\nFor a dozen years following the Civil War, the Union Army occupied the South, and African-American men could vote and run for political office. During these years, African Americans elected a large number of black and progressive white representatives to state governments across the South. Sixteen African Americans also served in the US Congress during these years, including two senators. For white elites, the Reconstruction era was a disaster. They would eventually create and distribute an image and historiography of Reconstruction that vilified both black representatives and black voters as ignorant, greedy, corrupt, and vengeful, truly unworthy of suffrage or indeed of any rights that whites were bound to respect.\n\nThe truth, as Du Bois shows in several chapters in Black Reconstruction , was quite different from this narrative. He believed that democracy, defended by federal troops, had allowed the working class to come to power in the South - fifty years before the Russian Revolution. Du Bois was tempted to describe this as a \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\" although he eventually decided to use the phrase \"dictatorship of labor\":\n\nAmong Negroes, and particularly in the South, there was being put into force one of the most extraordinary experiments of Marxism that the world, before the Russian revolution, had seen. That is, backed by the military power of the United States, a dictatorship of labor was to be attempted and those who were leading the Negro race in this vast experiment were emphasizing the necessity of the political power and organization backed by protective military power.\n\nSeveral interlocutors dissuaded Du Bois from using the term \" dictatorship of the proletariat .\" As he explained at the start of a chapter titled \"The Black Proletariat in South Carolina\":\n\nI first called this chapter \"The Dictatorship of the Black Proletariat in South Carolina,\" but it has been brought to my attention that this would not be correct since universal suffrage does not lead to a real dictatorship until workers use their votes consciously to rid themselves of the dominion of private capital.\n\nAccording to Du Bois, there were some indications of this intent among blacks in South Carolina, \"but it was always coupled with the idea of that day, that the only real escape for a laborer was himself to own capital.\" Indeed, most of the former slave workers wanted land of their own to work. Du Bois presumably used the phrase \"dictatorship of labor\" to signal that the Reconstruction governments were elected and supported by propertyless blacks and some poor whites - and that the officials so elected represented the interests of these workers.\n\nDu Bois insists that Reconstruction cannot be understood in race-centered terms - that is, as a struggle between the black and white races, fueled by racism. Rather, Reconstruction was a conflict among classes that were struggling to find new ways of surviving after the demise of the slave economy. \"Reconstruction,\" as Du Bois puts it,\n\nwas not simply a fight between the white and black races in the South or between master and ex-slave. It was much more subtle; it involved more than this. There have been repeated and continued attempts to paint this era as an interlude of petty politics or nightmare of race hate instead of viewing it slowly and broadly as a tremendous series of efforts to earn a living in new and untried ways, to achieve economic security and to restore fatal losses of capital and investment.\n\nFor Du Bois, the key actors of the Reconstruction era were workers (still divided by race, as before the war, into separate movements) and capitalists (divided into two main fractions). Reconstruction encompassed, first of all,\n\na vast labor movement of ignorant, earnest, and bewildered black men whose faces had been ground in the mud by their three awful centuries of degradation and who now staggered forward blindly in blood and tears amid petty division, hate and hurt, and surrounded by every disaster of war and industrial upheaval.\n\nSecond,\n\nReconstruction was a vast labor movement of ignorant, muddled and bewildered white men who had been disinherited of land and labor and fought a long battle with sheer subsistence, hanging on the edge of poverty, eating clay and chasing slaves and now lurching up to manhood.\n\nThird,\n\nReconstruction was the turn of white Northern migration southward to new and sudden economic opportunity which followed the disaster and dislocation of war, and an attempt to organize capital and labor on a new pattern and build a new economy.\n\nDu Bois is here referring to the Northern capitalists, both large and petty, who moved to the South in search of riches after the war - the \"carpetbagger capitalists,\" as he calls them. \"Finally,\" writes Du Bois,\n\nReconstruction was a desperate effort of a dislodged, maimed, impoverished and ruined oligarchy and monopoly to restore an anachronism in economic organization by force, fraud and slander, in defiance of law and order, and in the face of a great labor movement of white and black, and in bitter strife with a new capitalism and a new political framework.\n\nThis, of course, is the formerly slave-owning planter class. Du Bois attributes the turmoil, corruption, and violence of the Reconstruction era to the \"fierce fight\" among these classes and class fractions for control over the \"capitalist state.\"\n\nWhat were the key achievements of the \"dictatorships of labor\" in the South while they lasted? The fact that African Americans enjoyed a modicum of civil and political rights during this era is of course tremendously important. For the first time in its history, universal manhood suffrage prevailed in the United States. For Du Bois, perhaps the most important achievements of Reconstruction were the public schools and black colleges that were founded in this era. (Du Bois himself attended one of these colleges, Fisk, a mere decade after Reconstruction.) He devotes an entire chapter (\"Founding the Public School\") to this development, arguing that these schools were nothing less than \"the salvation of the South and the Negro.\"\n\nFor Du Bois, interestingly, these schools played an important moderating role. \"Without them,\" he writes, \"there can be no doubt that the Negro would have rushed into revolt and vengeance and played into the hands of those determined to crush him.\" Du Bois also praises the new schools (and the black church) for creating \"a little group of trained leadership.\" He credits these leaders, and their political moderation, with preventing the reestablishment of chattel slavery after Reconstruction:\n\nHad it not been for the Negro school and college, the Negro would, to all intents and purposes, have been driven back to slavery. His economic foothold in land and capital was too slight in ten years of turmoil to effect any defense or stability. His reconstruction leadership had come from Negroes educated in the North, and white politicians, capitalists and philanthropic teachers. The counterrevolution of 1876 drove most of these, save the teachers, away. But already, through establishing public schools and private colleges, and by organizing the Negro church, the Negro had acquired enough leadership and knowledge to thwart the worst designs of the new slave drivers.\n\nThese leaders, Du Bois suggests, \"avoided the mistake of trying to meet force by force.\" He praises their resilience and patience in the face of violent provocation: \"They bent to the storm of beating, lynching and murder, and kept their souls in spite of public and private insult of every description.\"\n\nNevertheless, Du Bois emphasizes that the main economic demand of the freedmen was never attained during Reconstruction: the extensive redistribution of land, including the big plantations, to the formerly enslaved. The typical freedman, according to Du Bois, had \"but one clear economic ideal and that was his demand for land, his demand that the great plantations be subdivided and given to him as his right.\" Du Bois writes that this demand was \"perfectly fair and natural\" and \"ought to have been an integral part of Emancipation.\" He points out that French, German, and Russian serfs and peasants were, \"on emancipation,\" given \"definite rights in the land.\" \"Only the American Negro slave was emancipated without such rights and in the end this spelled for him the continuation of slavery.\" More specifically, the absence of land reform in the South opened the door to a counterrevolution that would transform the propertyless freedmen into semislaves - indebted sharecroppers, convict laborers, and the like.\n\nDu Bois casts some blame for the absence of land reform upon the same black leaders whose moderation he otherwise praises. \"The Negro's own black leadership was naturally of many sorts,\" according to Du Bois:\n\nSome, like the whites, were petty bourgeois, seeking to climb to wealth; others were educated men, helping to develop a new nation without regard to mere race lines, while a third group were idealists, trying to uplift the Negro race and put them on a par with the whites. But how was this to be accomplished? In the minds of very few of them was there any clear and distinct plan for the development of a laboring class into a position of power and mastery over the modern industrial state. And in this lack of vision, they were not singular in America.\n\nDu Bois seems to be suggesting here that the weakness of socialist ideology among black leaders and Americans generally is responsible for \"this lack of vision.\" That said, the petty-bourgeois background of so many black leaders raises serious doubts about Du Bois's characterization of the Reconstruction governments as \"dictatorships of labor.\" In fact, as Eric Foner points out , most black politicians during Reconstruction were conservative or silent on the issue of land redistribution. On this particular issue, Du Bois's analysis should have been more materialist than it was.\n\nDu Bois was arguably even more concerned in Black Reconstruction with explaining the counterrevolution that overthrew Reconstruction than he was with celebrating its achievements. Hundreds of pages of the book discuss this issue, including two of the book's final chapters, namely, \"Counter-revolution of Property\" (chapter 14) and \"Back Toward Slavery\" (chapter 16). One of the key themes of these chapters is that this counterrevolution was brought about by a class (the planters) for economic reasons, not by a race (whites) for reasons of racial animus or racial ideology. This was truly, Du Bois emphasizes, a counterrevolution of property .\n\nDu Bois writes that \"the overthrow of Reconstruction was in essence a revolution inspired by property, and not a race war.\" Elsewhere he adds, \"It was not, then, race and culture calling out of the South in 1876; it was property and privilege, shrieking to its kind, and privilege and property heard and recognized the voice of its own.\" This was a bourgeois counterrevolution against the \"dictatorships of labor.\" This is how Du Bois summarizes this counterrevolution, otherwise known as the Compromise of 1876, which included the withdrawal of federal troops from the South:\n\nThe bargain of 1876 was essentially an understanding by which the Federal Government ceased to sustain the right to vote of half of the laboring population of the South, and left capital as represented by the old planter class, the new Northern capitalist, and the capitalist that began to rise out of the poor whites, with a control of labor greater than in any modern industrial state in civilized lands. Out of that there has arisen in the South an exploitation of labor unparalleled in modern times, with a government in which all pretense at party alignment or regard for universal suffrage is given up. The methods of government have gone uncriticized, and elections are by secret understanding and manipulation; the dictatorship of capital in the South is complete.\n\n\"The dictatorship of capital in the South is complete\" - not a dictatorship of an undifferentiated white race. In fact, Du Bois argues,\n\nThe new dictatorship became a manipulation of the white labor vote which followed the lines of similar control in the North, while it proceeded to deprive the black voter by violence and force of any vote at all. The rivalry of these two classes of labor and their competition neutralized the labor vote in the South.\n\nThe dictatorship of capital, in sum, brought about the oppression and disenfranchisement of black workers, in part to win the support of white workers. But while white workers kept the right to vote, they had little more political power than blacks. The outcome of the counterrevolution of 1876 was thus the racial oppression of black workers; the destruction of democracy; a divided working class; and the \"unparalleled\" exploitation of labor, black and white. Indeed, capital in the South enjoyed, in Du Bois's words, \"a control of labor greater than in any modern industrial state in civilized lands.\" Without civil and political rights, moreover, many black workers were eventually reduced to the status of semislaves, tied to planters by debt and violence. The planters would remain the politically dominant class in the South until their power was finally broken by the civil rights movement .\n\nThis brings us to the question of white working-class racism. Why did white workers support the dictatorship of capital and the oppression of black workers? Du Bois viewed such racism as extremely powerful and extensive, so much so that he sometimes doubted whether working-class solidarity and socialism were in any way realistic in the United States. In fact, Du Bois wrote Black Reconstruction during a period when he was unusually pessimistic about the possibility of interracial solidarity. The year before Black Reconstruction was published, Du Bois penned an infamous editorial in the Crisis , the magazine he long edited, which called for the voluntary self-segregation of African Americans. 60 The editorial stirred up a firestorm of criticism within the strongly integrationist (and interracial) NAACP.\n\nBut self-segregation was never a principle or ultimate end for Du Bois. It was a tactic - and one he gradually abandoned during the 1940s. Similarly, Du Bois never concluded in Black Reconstruction , or in any of his subsequent writings, that interracial working-class solidarity was impossible. It was just, at specific times and for specific reasons, very difficult to achieve. For Du Bois, white working-class racism was above all a puzzle that needed to be solved, not a permanent state of affairs. It troubled him because he was convinced that neither capitalism nor the racial oppression it produced could be overthrown if racism prevented the unification of white and black workers. And Du Bois was clear in Black Reconstruction that his ultimate goal was to unify \"slaves black, brown, yellow and white, under a dictatorship of the proletariat.\" There was no other road, as he saw it, to either the emancipation of labor or the overthrow of racial oppression.\n\nAs it happened, white workers in the South generally supported the overthrow of Reconstruction and the oppression of blacks. They generally supported, that is, the bourgeois counterrevolution of property that established a dictatorship of capital. What explains this paradox? Why would a group of workers who would have been stronger had they united with another group of workers instead support their exploiters in the oppression of that other group? Throughout Black Reconstruction , Du Bois emphasizes that white working-class animosity toward blacks stems from competition over jobs. Capitalism everywhere pits workers against one another, such that workers view others as competitors, even enemies. Capitalism creates a kind of war of all against all as workers scramble to find jobs and keep them. Of course, this war allows capitalists to keep wages low. For Du Bois, white working-class racism evolved out of their fear that capitalists would replace them with black workers, including newly emancipated workers, who were willing to work for lower wages. It was this same fear of competition, Du Bois argued, that had led to the formation of two labor movements in the antebellum period.\n\nThe fear of unemployment, according to Du Bois, was particularly strong before the creation of the modern welfare state. And so white workers used what power they had to exclude blacks from the labor market. Hence white demands that blacks be banished from certain occupations or workplaces; hence the exclusion of blacks from craft unions; hence white violence against black coworkers and strikebreakers. Racism could be \"found, invented and proved\" in order to justify these practices, in the same way that slaveowners had earlier \"found, invented and proved\" racism to justify theirs. Here is Du Bois explaining the violence of whites against African Americans:\n\nTotal depravity, human hate and Schadenfreude , do not explain fully the mob spirit in America. Before the wide eyes of the mob is ever the Shape of Fear. Back of the writhing, yelling, cruel-eyed demons who break, destroy, maim and lynch and burn at the stake, is a knot, large or small, of normal human beings, and these human beings at heart are desperately afraid of something. Of what? Of many things, but usually of losing their jobs, being declassed, degraded, or actually disgraced; of losing their hopes, their savings, their plans for their children; of the actual pangs of hunger, of dirt, of crime. And of all this, most ubiquitous in modern industrial society is that fear of unemployment.\n\nWhite workers, in short, believed that it was better to be exploited than not to be exploited (i.e., unemployed). They feared unemployment, which meant no wages, more than they feared low wages. And so white workers sided with people who were offering jobs and looked like them instead of with darker people who shared their plight. This was an understandable decision but an error nonetheless. White workers as well as black suffered - and continue to suffer - from their lack of solidarity.\n\nDu Bois also emphasizes that the planter class was ever prepared to encourage and aggravate the animosity between white and black workers. \"They lied about the Negroes,\" he writes, and \"accused them of theft, crime, moral enormities and laughable grotesqueries.\" The planters' purpose was to forestall \"the danger of a united Southern labor movement by appealing to the fear and hate of white labor and offering them alliance and leisure.\" The planters, Du Bois writes, encouraged white workers \"to ridicule Negroes and beat them, kill and burn their bodies\" and \"even gave the poor whites their daughters in marriage, and raised a new oligarchy on the tottering, depleted foundations of the old.\"\n\nDu Bois very briefly presents another explanation for white working-class racism - in the post-Reconstruction era - that has become the focus of much attention. His discussion of this spans only a few paragraphs, but it is sometimes discussed as if it were the very core of Black Reconstruction . And it is the source of the most popular catchphrase of the book - although Du Bois himself never used the phrase - namely, \" the wages of whiteness .\"\n\nDu Bois suggests that white workers in the South - but not blacks - received \"a sort of public and psychological wage\" as a supplement to the low wages paid by their employers. Of what did this wage consist? Du Bois points out that white workers could enter public parks, send their children to \"the best schools,\" and apply for jobs in police departments. Blacks could do none of these things. White workers could also walk public streets without being accosted or assaulted; blacks could not. In addition, white workers had the right to vote, and while this did not result in any real political power, the courts treated them with leniency because they were dependent on white votes. Blacks could not vote, so the courts treated them harshly.\n\nDu Bois is mainly alluding here to the civil and political rights of white workers, and to the exercise of those rights. Calling these rights a \"psychological\" wage, however, is confusing: these rights were real and enforceable; they did not just exist in the heads or minds of white workers. In any event, \"the wages of whiteness\" turn out to consist primarily of the civil and political rights enjoyed by white workers but denied to blacks following Reconstruction. White workers had certain rights in addition to low wages; black workers had no rights and even lower wages. This is a useful shorthand description of the Jim Crow era.\n\nDu Bois also includes \"public deference and titles of courtesy\" in the extra \"wage\" that white workers but not black were given. White workers had a certain status (at least among other whites) that blacks did not. And Du Bois notes that newspapers flattered the poor whites while ignoring or ridiculing blacks. Here again, these things were not just in the minds of white workers, so calling them \"psychological\" is odd. \"The wages of whiteness\" refers to the rights and status enjoyed by white workers in addition to their low wages.\n\nThe question is: How do these \"wages\" explain racism? They describe a racist society, but how do they produce racial hatred or violence? Du Bois does not say much about this, but he implies that white workers felt compelled to resist any effort to extend to black workers the same rights and deference they received:\n\n[White] laborers . . . would rather have low wages upon which they could eke out an existence than see colored labor with a decent wage. White labor saw in every advance of Negroes a threat to their racial prerogatives, so that in many districts Negroes were afraid to build decent homes or dress well, or own carriages, bicycles or automobiles, because of possible retaliation on the part of the whites. Thus every problem of labor advance in the South was skillfully turned by demagogues into a matter of inter-racial jealousy.\n\nIf blacks enjoyed the same rights and social esteem as white workers, Du Bois seems to say, white workers could no longer claim to be superior to them or to anyone else in society - and that, by implication, was presumably intolerable to whites, even if it meant \"eking out an existence.\"\n\nDu Bois thus presents two explanations for the racism of white workers: white workers become racists to justify their efforts to prevent black workers from replacing them at work, and they become racists to justify their efforts to prevent blacks from enjoying the same rights and status they enjoy. There is undoubtedly some truth to both these arguments. But it is also obvious to Du Bois that neither adequately explains why white workers could not or would not come to see that a united front with black workers against capitalists would result in higher wages, greater rights, and a higher status for themselves as well as for black workers. This failure of vision, Du Bois understood, is not inevitable.\n\nIn fact, Du Bois clearly did not believe that his two explanations worked in all times and places. As noted earlier, Du Bois held out hope in Black Reconstruction for the emancipation of \"slaves black, brown, yellow and white, under a dictatorship of the proletariat.\" As we shall see, he would later praise certain trade unions for building interracial solidarity, and he would advise radical black youth that the liberation of both blacks and whites depended upon their mutual cooperation and friendship. Du Bois never developed a simple formula or technique for bringing about working-class solidarity. Of course, no such formula or technique exists. But Black Reconstruction reminds us why workers' solidarity is so important, and Du Bois would preach the gospel of interracial solidarity for the rest of his days. He later wrote that Black Reconstruction marks a break with his earlier \"provincial racialism\" and was an attempt \"to envisage the broader problems of work and income as affecting all men regardless of color or nationality.\"\n\nDu Bois would remain a committed socialist and Marxist until his death in 1963. Black Reconstruction , in other words, was just one part - the most extraordinary part, no doubt - of a larger body of Marxist work written by Du Bois. Unfortunately, Du Bois also became a Stalinist, and he would articulate a view of socialism that was deeply problematic. A brief review of some of Du Bois's key writings after 1935 demonstrates that Black Reconstruction was by no means a unique or unusual foray into Marxist theory.\n\nIn 1940, Du Bois published an autobiography, Dusk of Dawn . He was then seventy-two years old. (A second autobiography was published posthumously in the United States in 1968.) Near the end of this volume, Du Bois presents a \"Basic American Negro Creed\" that he originally wrote in 1936, as an appendix to an essay in which, among other things, he declared his belief in Marxism. \"We believe,\" the creed states, \"in the ultimate triumph of some form of Socialism the world over; that is, common ownership and control of the means of production and equality of income.\" Toward this end, the creed advocates that \"Negro workers should join the labor movement and affiliate with such trade unions as welcome them and treat them fairly. We believe that workers' Councils organized by Negroes for interracial understanding should strive to fight race prejudice in the working class.\" And the creed calls \"for vesting the ultimate power of the state in the hands of the workers.\" Working-class solidarity, interracial unionism, the fight against racism, common ownership of the means of production, and workers' control of the state - this is Du Bois's program for black workers and, indeed, for working people around the globe.\n\nSeveral years later, during World War II, Du Bois would become preoccupied, and not for the first time, with the question of colonialism. A longtime advocate of pan-Africanism, Du Bois rightly worried that colonialism would endure long after World War II, despite the high-minded phrases and promises of European leaders during the war. Shortly after presiding at the Fifth Pan-African Conference in Manchester, England, Du Bois summarized his views about the capitalist basis of colonialism and the color line in his book Color and Democracy . \"Not until we face the fact,\" writes Du Bois, \"that colonies are a method of investment yielding unusual [i.e., large] returns, or expected to do so, will we realize that the colonial system is part of the battle between capital and labor in the modern economy.\"\n\nDu Bois goes on to criticize the race-centered view of imperialism when he presents his own alternative perspective:\n\nIt happens, not for biological or historical reasons, that most of the inhabitants of colonies today have colored skins. This does not make them one group or race or even allied biological groups or races. In fact these colored people vary vastly in physique, history, and cultural experience. The one thing that unites them today in the world's thought is their poverty, ignorance, and disease, which renders them all, in different degrees, unresisting victims of modern capitalistic exploitation. On this foundation the modern \"Color Line\" has been built, with all its superstitions and pseudo-science. And it is this complex today which more than anything else excuses the suppression of democracy, not only in Asia and Africa, but in Europe and the Americas. Hitler seized on \"negroid\" characteristics to accuse the French of inferiority. Britain points to miscegenation with colored races to prove democracy impossible in South America. But it is left to the greatest modern democracy, the United States, to defend human slavery and caste, and even defeat democratic government in its own boundaries, ostensibly because of an inferior race, but really in order to make profits out of cheap labor, both black and white.\n\nRacism, in other words, is the \"ostensible\" motivation behind - and a justification for - slavery, caste, and colonialism. But this is a fig leaf - or \"camouflage,\" as Du Bois wrote in Black Reconstruction . The actual motivation is the accumulation of profits by means of cheap labor. Herein, for Du Bois, is the secret of \"white supremacy\": the capitalist imperative to exploit labor is achieved by creating a color line that oppresses workers of color and deceives white workers into believing they are superior to them, thereby dividing and cheapening all labor.\n\nFollowing World War II, Du Bois entered into the orbit of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of the United States, a group from which he had long kept his distance for a variety of reasons, despite his enthusiasm for the Soviet Union. In October 1946, Du Bois was invited to speak in Columbia, South Carolina, to delegates of the Southern Negro Youth Congress, a group founded by the Communist Party. (Paul Robeson and the novelist Howard Fast spoke to the group the night before Du Bois's speech.) In his address, \" Behold the Land ,\" Du Bois advises the delegates:\n\nSlowly but surely the working people of the South, white and black, must come to remember that their emancipation depends upon their mutual cooperation; upon their acquaintanceship with each other; upon their friendship; upon their social intermingling. Unless this happens each is going to be made the football to break the heads and hearts of the other.\n\nDu Bois goes on to say:\n\nThe oil and sulphur; the coal and iron; the cotton and corn; the lumber and cattle belong to you the workers, black and white, and not to the thieves who hold them and use them to enslave you. They can be rescued and restored to the people if you have the guts to strive for the real right to vote, the right to real education, the right to happiness and health and the total abolition of the father of these scourges of mankind, poverty.\n\nDu Bois then speaks of the white workers, the \"poor whites,\" of the South. He has become much less pessimistic about the possibility of interracial solidarity than he was a decade earlier:\n\nIt may seem like a failing fight when the newspapers ignore you; when every effort is made by white people in the South to count you out of citizenship and to act as though you did not exist as human beings while all the time they are profiting by your labor, gleaning wealth from your sacrifices and trying to build a nation and a civilization upon your degradation. You must remember that despite all this, you have allies, and allies even in the white South. First and greatest of these possible allies are the white working classes about you, the poor whites whom you have been taught to despise and who in turn have learned to fear and hate you. This must not deter you from efforts to make them understand, because in the past, in their ignorance and suffering, they have been led foolishly to look upon you as the cause of most of their distress.\n\nThis attitude, Du Bois suggests, \"has been deliberately cultivated ever since emancipation.\" He insists that the color line between black and white workers must be broken, a division deliberately fostered by capitalists and their political servants. This was an idea to which Du Bois returned again and again during his final decades, an idea that goes back at least to his 1920 essay \" On Work and Wealth .\"\n\nAs we have seen, Du Bois encouraged black workers to join trade unions in his 1936 \"creed.\" In the following years, Du Bois continued to see trade unions, especially the industrial unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), as the best hope for creating interracial working-class solidarity in the United States. In a 1948 essay , Du Bois writes, \"Probably the greatest and most effective effort toward interracial understanding among the working masses has come about through the trade unions.\" The CIO's efforts had brought about \"an astonishing spread of interracial tolerance and understanding. Probably no movement in the last 30 years,\" he wrote, \"has been so successful in softening race prejudice among the masses.\"\n\nIn this same 1948 text, Du Bois reiterates his belief that racism and imperialism - and wars of liberation - are primarily generated by capitalists and their pursuit of profits:\n\n[T]he American Negro is part of a world situation. Negroes are in a quasi-colonial status. They belong to the lower classes of the world. These classes are, have been, and are going to be for a long time exploited by the more powerful groups and nations in the world for the benefit of those groups. The real problem before the United States is whether we are really beginning to reason about this world-wide feeling of class dominance with its resultant wars: wars for rivalry for the sharing of the spoils of exploitation, and wars against exploitation.\n\nIt is telling that Du Bois describes imperialism and colonialism here in terms of exploitation and class dominance and not in terms of national or racial oppression. Of course, Du Bois fully understands that colonialism entails national and racial oppression, but its primary cause is the capitalist's search for cheap labor.\n\nAt the height of McCarthyism in the United States, in 1950, Du Bois drafted a book-length manuscript called \"Russia and America: An Interpretation.\" His publisher refused to print it because it was too pro-Soviet and too critical of the United States. Incredibly, it has still not been published. One important section of this book - the whole of which is too long to adequately summarize here - argues that the Soviet Union is more democratic than the United States because Soviet citizens are able to discuss, debate, and decide \"matters of vital interest to the people, that is, work and wage and living conditions - matters not simply of interest, but of personal knowledge and experience.\" For Du Bois, clearly, this is the core meaning of socialist democracy:\n\nEverybody wants to talk about these matters; everyone attends meetings twice or three times a week; they discuss the local industries; the water supply, the schools and the man or woman best fitted to represent their thought and decision in the county meetings. If the delegate selected does not act and vote as they wish, they recall him and substitute another.\n\n\"It is a mistake,\" Du Bois concludes, \"to think democracy has been throttled in the Soviet Republics.\" He likens local soviets to New England town meetings, a venue in which ordinary people \"come together to talk, propose, argue, and to decide; to elect a delegate to a higher Soviet which in turn elects to one still higher and so on to the Supreme Soviet. Here is pure and effective democracy,\" Du Bois suggests, \"such as has almost disappeared from the United States.\" In the United States, in fact, \"our election of the president, appointment of judges, representation in the Senate and inequality of electoral districts show the legal restraints on democracy; while extralegally but by common consent are disfranchisement of Negroes and the poor, the use of money in elections, and the well-paid lobbyists of Big Business in our legislatures, not to mention the press and periodical monopoly.\" Du Bois concludes,\n\nIt is with the greatest difficulty that the American electorate gets a chance to express its mind or receive the truth upon which to make up its mind; or secure sanctions by which it may make its legislators carry out the popular will. In both Great Britain and France, and in pre-war Germany and Italy, and certainly in the United States, the will of the people has long been thwarted by wealth, privilege, and ignorance.\n\nIn 1952, Du Bois began teaching at the interracial Jefferson School of Social Science in Manhattan, which was devoted to workers' education. The school was established by the Communist Party to educate working-class people and to train class-conscious militants. Du Bois taught courses on imperialism, the slave trade, Africa, pan-Africanism, and Reconstruction. (The writer Lorraine Hansberry was in his first class.) The course on Reconstruction argued that the socialist revolution requires interracial solidarity against capitalists. Du Bois taught at the Jefferson School until 1956, when it was forced to close.\n\nDu Bois's politics were never closer to the Communist Party's during these years, and, as we have seen, his enthusiasm for the Soviet Union continued unabated. In 1953, Du Bois penned a paean to Stalin - with the obligatory insults to Trotsky - following the death of the Soviet leader. Du Bois justified the Soviet dictatorship as necessary until such time as Soviet workers were \"more intelligent, more experienced and in less danger from interference from without.\" It was just such alleged interference, moreover, that led Du Bois to support the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Not surprisingly, he vehemently denied that socialism must be democratic, although that was certainly his ideal.\n\nDu Bois's vision of socialism is problematic, to say the least. It was based in part on his long-standing belief that smarter and better educated people - the \"talented tenth,\" as he called them - had a responsibility to lead \"ignorant\" and uneducated people, who were not capable of governing themselves. Du Bois saw Stalin (and later Mao Zedong) as educated and experienced leaders who were selflessly pulling - or perhaps dragging - masses of ignorant peasants into the twentieth century. Their noble ends allegedly justified their often-brutal methods. This kind of elitism erupts, incidentally, in a little-noted passage in Black Reconstruction in which Du Bois states that it would have been \"best\" (even if politically impractical) if there had been a property qualification for voting after the Civil War and only a \"gradual enfranchisement\" of black workers, pending the establishment of public schools throughout the South.\n\nDu Bois drafted a second autobiography in 1958-59 and slightly revised it in 1960. The Autobiography of W. E. B. Du Bois was edited by his friend Herbert Aptheker, a longtime Communist Party activist whom Du Bois had befriended after the war and whom he would appoint as his literary executor. Shortened versions of the Autobiography were published in the Soviet Union in 1962 and shortly later, posthumously, in China and East Germany. It was finally published in the United States in 1968. In this text, Du Bois again expresses his Marxist beliefs and distances himself from his earlier \"racialism\" or race-centered views. \"I believe in the dictum of Karl Marx,\" he writes, \"that the economic foundation of a nation is widely decisive for its politics, its art and its culture.\" Du Bois adds that as a young man, \"What I wanted was the same economic opportunities that white Americans had. Beyond this I was not thinking\":\n\nI . . . did not realize what wretched exploitation white Americans and white workers of all sorts faced and had faced in the past, and would face in years to come. Although a student of social progress, I did not know the labor development in the United States. I was bitter at lynching, but not moved by the treatment of white miners in Colorado or Montana. I never sang the songs of Joe Hill, and the terrible strike at Lawrence, Massachusetts, did not stir me, because I knew that factory strikers like these would not let a Negro work beside them or live in the same town. It was hard for me to outgrow this mental isolation, and to see that the plight of the white workers was fundamentally the same as that of the black, even if the white worker helped enslave the black .\n\nA group of workers who would have been empowered by uniting with another group of workers instead helped to oppress that other group. This is the tragedy - and the puzzle - of the American labor movement of Du Bois's time. But Du Bois's earlier racialism, he implies, not only blinded him to the exploitation of workers of all races but thereby prevented him from understanding the true nature of the racial oppression of blacks.\n\nDu Bois also speaks in the Autobiography about the type of society he desires: \"I believe in communism,\" he writes. \"I mean by communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part.\" Du Bois adds that \"all men should be employed according to their ability and that wealth and services should be distributed according to need. Once I thought that these ends could be attained under capitalism,\" Du Bois notes, but \"After earnest observation I now believe that private ownership of capital and free enterprise are leading the world to disaster.\" Du Bois adds that democratic government in the United States \"has almost ceased to function,\" noting that one-quarter of adults are disenfranchised and half do not vote. \"We are ruled by those who control wealth and who by that power buy or coerce public opinion.\"\n\nDu Bois settled in Ghana in 1961 to work on a projected multivolume Encyclopedia Africana . He died there in 1963 at the age of ninety-five. Before he left the United States, Du Bois applied for membership in the Communist Party of the United States, to which he had been close since World War II. Du Bois's last major speech in the United States addressed, not surprisingly, the topic of \"Socialism and the American Negro.\" It was delivered in May 1960 at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Folkways Records produced a vinyl recording of the speech that same year.\n\nIn this speech, Du Bois reiterated his belief that \"there is no doubt that the world of the twenty-first century will be overwhelmingly communistic.\" He also offered some interesting critical reflections, from a Marxist perspective, on the civil rights movement, which was by then in full swing. (The student sit-in movement began in February 1960 and spread across the South in a matter of weeks.) Du Bois's thoughts are worth quoting at length:\n\nThe legal fight led by the NAACP has been an astonishing success. But its very success shows the limitations of law, and law enforcement, unless it has an economic program; unless the mass of Negro people have not simply legal rights, but have such rights to work and wage that enable them to live decently. Here in the United States we have had a stirring, in the Negro population, which emphasized these facts. . . . The experience in Montgomery, the extraordinary uprising of students, all over the south and beginning in the north, shows an awareness of our situation which is most encouraging. But it still does not reach the center of the problem. And that center is not simply the right of Americans to spend their money as they wish and according to law, but the chance for American Negroes to have money to spend, because of employment in which they can make a decent wage . What then is the next step? It is for American Negroes in increasing numbers, and more and more widely, to insist upon the legal rights which are already theirs, and to add to that increasingly a socialistic form of government, an insistence upon the welfare state, which denies the further carrying out of industry for the profit of those corporations which monopolize wealth and power.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr - who also became a socialist, like Du Bois - would say much the same thing about the necessity of decent wages for blacks just a few years later, demanding , among other things, a guaranteed income for all. And like Du Bois, King became a strong advocate of multiracial trade unionism and working-class solidarity as the best means to end poverty and racism.\n\nDu Bois's turn to socialism and Marxism did not entail any lessening of his interest in or disgust with racism and the color line. Du Bois was committed to destroying racial oppression before he became a Marxist, and he remained just as committed to destroying racial oppression after he became a Marxist. Du Bois became an unapologetic Marxist and a committed socialist, in fact, not in spite of his hatred of racial oppression, but precisely because of that hatred. He was driven and attracted to Marxism and socialism by his quest to understand racial oppression and the best strategy to destroy it. Of course, his understanding of both racism and how we might subvert it changed radically once he became a Marxist and a socialist. This change is missed by scholars who assume that Du Bois's ideas were essentially fixed around the time he wrote The Souls of Black Folk .\n\nDu Bois came to believe that the exploitation of the labor of black, brown, and \"yellow\" workers was the main foundation of and motivation for racial oppression around the globe and that the liberation of people of color, accordingly - all people of color, and not just workers - required the elimination of this exploitation, that is, socialism. Du Bois also looked at the \"color line\" differently after he became a Marxist. For the socialist Du Bois, the color line was problematic because it divided workers as well as races and thereby rendered working-class solidarity and socialist revolution - and the eradication of racial oppression as he now understood it - more difficult.\n\nDu Bois deserves to be remembered as an eloquent critic of capitalism and its ineluctable consequences: racial oppression, colonialism, imperialism, war, poverty, and gross inequality, political as well as economic. Du Bois saw a clear relationship between capitalism and racial oppression, namely, cause and effect. He ranks among the most astute Marxists who have addressed the question of racial oppression, an incredibly rich tradition that includes such luminaries as Hubert Harrison, Claude McKay, José Carlos Mariátegui, Max Shachtman, C. L. R. James, Eric Williams, Harry Haywood, Herbert Aptheker, Oliver Cromwell Cox, Claudia Jones, Frantz Fanon, Walter Rodney, Harold Wolpe, Neville Alexander, Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Stuart Hall, Adolph Reed, and Barbara Fields, among many others. We need to recognize and credit not only the Marxist Du Bois but this entire pantheon of Marxist theorists of race. Du Bois did not transcend this tradition, as some have implied. He was at the heart of it.\n\nAt his best, Du Bois could also be an eloquent advocate for democratic socialism - for multiracial working-class solidarity, for workers' control of the state and economy, and for an economy based on human needs. It is true that Du Bois's elitist vision of socialism was deeply flawed, and his apologetics for Stalin's dictatorship and authoritarian socialism are indefensible and detract from his legacy. Yet many of his contemporary acolytes deny the Marxist Du Bois, portraying him as a race-centered theorist or an \"intersectionalist.\" He was neither. Black Reconstruction in America , I have shown, is a brilliant Marxist study that explains racial oppression and racism as products of capitalism. Denying Du Bois's Marxism results in a distorted view of Du Bois's life and ideas, including, ironically, his analysis of racial oppression and how we might destroy it.\n\nJeff Goodwin teaches sociology at New York University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet 2018 also marks the 150 th anniversary of 1868 - the height of Black Power during Reconstruction .\n\nIt's not surprising this anniversary has been ignored. Reconstruction is given short shrift in classrooms across the country and history textbooks tend to focus their narrative on the battles between the president and Congress. The year 1868 comes up in textbooks as significant only because of the election of Ulysses S. Grant. This focus on those at the top misses the groundswell of activity that made the year so explosive.\n\nWe lost one of the few historians who wrote about the importance of 1868 earlier this year. Lerone Bennett Jr, historian, journalist, and editor at Ebony magazine for decades, died this February at the age of eighty-nine. His book on Reconstruction, Black Power U.S.A. , remains one of the most powerful and engaging texts on the era.\n\nBennett calls 1868 \"The Glory Year\":\n\nIn the North, in this year, there was wild talk of using troops to forcibly dissolve Congress and arrest its leaders; and in the South thousands on thousands of angry Black people thronged the dusty roads, shouting defiance and demanding a division of the loaves and fishes. This was the year of the Fourteenth Amendment; this was the year men made the Declaration of Independence walk in the streets; this was the year almost all things were made new .... During the whole of this pivotal year, the South vibrated with the impassioned sounds of extraordinary assemblages of Blacks, native whites, and Northern newcomers.\n\nIt was in 1868, in state after state, when Black men, many of them formerly enslaved, gathered with white men, many of them poor and disempowered until Reconstruction, to rewrite the constitutions of the South.\n\nIn the early years following the Civil War , however, far from having the power to reshape the basic law of the land, for many Blacks it seemed as if freedom would not be that different from slavery. After Lincoln's assassination, President Johnson pardoned former slaveowners, returning land to them that had been confiscated and given to freedpeople, and laid out extremely lenient requirements for Southern states to rejoin the union.\n\nJohnson's actions gave a green light to white planters who led violent campaigns to intimidate freedpeople back into submission. Southern states passed new laws known as Black Codes, aimed at imposing slavery by another name. For example, Mississippi demanded that freedpeople carry proof they had entered into a labor contract or they could be imprisoned. The law also forbade African Americans from renting or leasing land. In South Carolina, Blacks unwilling to be farm workers had to get special permission from a court.\n\nBut throughout the South , Black people refused to go back. They organized into Union Leagues, defending each other from white attacks and organizing boycotts and strikes to prevent plantation owners from imposing slavery-like conditions. They organized Black political conventions across the South to demand the right to vote, schools, fair wages, and land. They marched, protested, and flooded Congress with petitions and resolutions. Their efforts were successful.\n\nWhen Congress convened in 1866, they refused to seat the delegates - many of them former Confederates - from Johnson's state governments. Instead, they came up with their own Reconstruction plan requiring states to hold new conventions to rewrite state constitutions and adopt the Fourteenth Amendment declaring Black people citizens whose rights could not be violated by laws like the Black Codes.\n\nBy the time the new voter registration process was completed, Blacks were a majority of the registered voters in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Georgia. In South Carolina, there were nearly two Blacks registered for every white person. In every other Southern state, they held sizable and influential minorities.\n\nStarting in Alabama in November of 1867 and ending with Texas that opened its convention in June of 1868, multiracial assemblies met in Southern state capitol buildings - most built by the labor of the enslaved - to radically alter the political and economic landscape.\n\nAs Bennett points out,\n\nHere were no middle-class lawyers and businessmen speaking for the people. Here, for the first and last time in America, was an assemblage of people, many of them poor, speaking for themselves .... Although experienced men, some of them lawyers and former legislators, moved to the fore in many places, there was, in every state convention, an articulate core of common people who spoke with uncommon authority, not because they had conferred with the people, but because they were the people.\n\nIn the name of the people these delegates fought to make Southern constitutions reflect social and economic justice. The Mississippi state convention passed a tax for the relief of needy freedmen and a resolution that would have returned property taken from freedmen if it hadn't been vetoed by the general controlling the state. In Alabama, a resolution passed that allowed freedmen to collect $10 a month in back pay from former masters for any work completed after January 1, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation took effect.\n\nIn South Carolina, the only state where Blacks made up a majority of the delegates, the convention passed a resolution asking Congress to lend the state $1 million to buy land for poor whites and Blacks. When Congress rejected the proposal, the first South Carolina legislature under the new constitution passed a homestead law to aid poor farmers and shifted the tax burden to large plantation owners.\n\nAt a time when even most Northern states restricted the franchise to white men, every convention extended suffrage to Black men and a few delegates, like W. J. Whipper in South Carolina and Thomas Bayne in Virginia, pushed to extend the franchise to women as well. Several conventions expanded women's property rights and in South Carolina, legalized divorce.\n\nAlso unlike the Northern constitutions, the South's new laws protected Black civil rights. Blacks could now hold office, serve on juries, and several constitutions explicitly banned the kind of discrimination that would later characterize the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe Reconstruction conventions provided for the first tax-supported public schools throughout the South. A few states even mandated integration. Louisiana's constitution, for example, provided for free public education for \"all children between 6 and 21 years of age\" and emphasized that \"there shall be no separate schools or institutions of learning established exclusively for any race.\"\n\nYet none of these accomplishments is highlighted in today's corporate textbooks. Glencoe's American Journey , offers one line summing up these revolutionary conventions: \"By 1868, seven Southern states - Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina - had established new governments and met the requirements for readmission.\" Even this is more than most textbooks allot. The texts that I've reviewed mention African Americans as beneficiaries of Congress's benevolent policies, not as actors in securing their own liberation.\n\nThe history of this transformative year is worth resurrecting. Like in 1968, the achievements of the Black freedom struggle, inspired others to fight against their own oppression. 1868 was also the year that organizing pressured Congress to enact an eight-hour work day for federal employees. William Sylvis, who argued that Black and women workers should be welcomed into the white male labor movement, was elected president of the National Labor Union - the first national labor federation. Augusta Lewis formed the first female union, the Women's Typographical Union in New York City, and made common cause with suffragists. Women's rights advocates and abolitionists still worked together for universal suffrage in the American Equal Rights Association.\n\nThe explosion of grassroots activism during 1868 offers us the opportunity to bring this democratic ferment into classrooms and activist meetings. In a role-play activity I wrote with the Zinn Education Project's Nqobile Mthethwa, participants take on the roles of Sylvis, Lewis, and others who fought for women's and workers' rights, as well as P. B. S. Pinchback, W. J. Whipper, and other key players in the 1868 conventions. As participants \"meet\" these individuals, they learn about the revolutionary possibility of solidarity. They also learn how racism, sexism, and classism can divide movements with devastating consequences. The dissolution of these alliances helped pave the path for Reconstruction's end.\n\nYet in 1868, what had seemed impossible only a decade before - four million enslaved people wielding political power in the South - became a reality. Black Southerners led a political revolution that for a short time advanced the interests of all poor and working-class people. The implications of this achievement are hard to grasp. In today's deeply unequal society the typical US Congress member - a majority of whom are millionaires - is at least twelve times richer than the ordinary US citizen. How might society change if teachers, nurses, waiters, transportation and construction workers, and other working-class people rewrote the laws of the land? Recalling a time when the empowerment of the most oppressed in our society paved the way for other social struggles also gives weight to today's slogan that all lives will matter only when Black lives matter.\n\n1868 is a year we should remember and learn from.\n\nAdam Sanchez ( [email protected] ) teaches at Harvest Collegiate High School in New York City.

For A. Philip Randolph, labor and civil rights were one and the same.\n\nA.

Philip Randolph, the influential twentieth-century labor and civil rights leader, would no doubt have mixed feelings about the state of labor in the United States today. On the one hand, union density has declined precipitously over the last half-century, from roughly one-third to one-tenth of all workers. On the other hand, there's been an upsurge of union organizing in recent years, particularly among black and brown workers.\n\nAs the leader of the first successful black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters , Randolph was committed to organizing black workers, particularly at a time when many unions excluded African Americans. By the 1960s, most unions had welcomed black workers into their ranks, although it took a few more decades for these workers to rise into positions of union leadership. Today, black workers have the highest unionization rates - 12.8 percent, compared with 11.2 percent for white workers, 10 percent for Latino workers, and 9.2 percent for Asian-American workers.\n\nA new report shows that the number of American workers represented by a union increased by two hundred thousand, to a total of more than sixteen million, between 2021 and 2022. The entire increase was among workers of color. No, that's not an exaggeration. The number of black workers represented by a union increased by 142,000, Latino workers by 101,000, and Asian-American workers by 64,000. Meanwhile, the number of unionized white workers declined by 31,000.\n\nBecause nonunion jobs grew at a faster rate than union jobs, however, the share of workers represented by a union declined from 11.6 percent in 2021 to 11.3 percent in 2022 - continuing a decades-long trend of declining union density. Whatever the gains among black and brown workers, Randolph would be dismayed by this development, believing as he did that a strong multiracial labor movement was a bulwark of democracy, a protector of human rights, and an antidote to racism. As he wrote in a March 1919 editorial in his radical magazine the Messenger :\n\nThe history of the labor movement in America proves that the employing classes recognize no race lines. They will exploit a white man as readily as a black man. They will exploit any race or class in order to make profits. The combination of black and white workers will be a powerful lesson to the capitalists of the solidarity of labor.\n\nIt was this advocacy of a multiracial labor movement united against the elite few that made Randolph the \"most dangerous Negro in America,\" and which necessitates preserving his legacy today.\n\nSchools in New York City, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Jacksonville, Florida are named in Randolph's honor, but it is unlikely that their students know much, if anything, about him. Nor is it likely that people walking through A. Philip Randolph Square in Harlem or A. Philip Randolph Heritage Park in Jacksonville, or people passing by the five-foot bronze statue of Randolph at Boston's Back Bay train station or the statue of him in the concourse of Union Station in Washington, DC, could identify who he was or what he accomplished.\n\nThat's unfortunate, because Randolph was an inspiring presence throughout the twentieth century. He built bridges between black and white workers, and between the labor and civil rights movements. He recognized that unions played a key role in channeling white workers' frustrations and anger toward corporate America rather than scapegoating black workers - a much-needed lesson in this age of Trump-ignited racism among many white Americans.\n\nThe son of an ordained minister and a seamstress , Randolph grew up in Jacksonville. An outstanding student, he attended the Cookman Institute, the only academic high school in Florida for African Americans. There he excelled in literature, drama, and public speaking; starred on the baseball team; sang solos with its choir; and was valedictorian of his graduating class of 1907.\n\nIn 1911 Randolph moved to Harlem, the cultural, political, and economic capital of black America. He worked menial jobs while taking night courses in English literature and sociology at City College and participating in the radical intellectual and political ferment of the times. He was drawn to socialism and to acting. He helped organize Harlem's Shakespearean Society and played the roles of Hamlet, Othello, and Romeo. He gave up his ambition to become a professional actor, but he fused his talents for acting and organizing by becoming a socialist soapbox orator on the streets of Harlem.\n\nHe met Chandler Owen, a law student at Columbia University, and they formed a number of short-lived political, community, and labor groups. One was the Brotherhood of Labor, an employment agency in Harlem, which they hoped would catalyze union organizing among black workers, but it went nowhere.\n\nIn 1917 Randolph and Chandler started the Messenger , which they called \"the only magazine of scientific radicalism in the world published by Negroes.\" The monthly publication mixed politics and culture. It promoted the Harlem Renaissance, crusaded against lynching and US involvement in World War I, and encouraged black Americans to join unions and embrace socialism.\n\nAlso in 1917 Randolph organized a union of elevator operators and two years later became president of the National Brotherhood of Workers of America, which organized black shipyard workers in Virginia. But in 1921, the white-dominated American Federation of Labor (AFL) undermined Randolph's efforts and the union fell apart.\n\nRandolph criticized the prominent black intellectual-activist W. E. B. Du Bois's focus on organizing the \"talented tenth\" of African Americans rather than building a mass movement that included black workers and farmers. Randolph's efforts to that movement were not restricted to unions; he was also active in the Socialist Party and even ran for office. Randolph led the Harlem wing of Morris Hillquit's 1917 Socialist campaign for New York City mayor. Three years later, the Socialist Party nominated Randolph himself for New York State Comptroller. He didn't win, but he garnered 202,361 votes - only one thousand less than Eugene Debs , the party's presidential candidate.\n\nThrough his magazine, speeches, and political campaigns, Randolph made a name for himself. But not all who knew of his activism were fans: in 1919, A. Mitchell Palmer, President Woodrow Wilson's attorney general who was responsible for the anti-socialist Palmer Raids during the First Red Scare , labeled Randolph the \"most dangerous Negro in America.\" In the heat of World War I, Palmer had Randolph arrested for treason for his antiwar views; he spent two days in jail but was not prosecuted.\n\nAt the time, Randolph had done little to earn Palmer's label, but that would change.\n\nIn 1925 a group of black porters for the Pullman Company came to Randolph for help organizing for better wages and working conditions. The company hired black men as porters - waiters and luggage handlers - on its sleeping cars, a form of luxury travel. At its peak, the Pullman Company was the largest single employer of black men in the United States, employing twelve thousand.\n\nBeing a Pullman porter was among the best-paid jobs available to black men, and as a bonus it offered the opportunity to travel around the country. But working conditions were onerous. Porters worked as many as eighty to one hundred hours a week. They were not paid for overnight layovers and were excluded from the better jobs, such as conductor, which were reserved for whites. They relied on tips for most of their income, which meant they had to endure the racist insults and rudeness of white passengers, including the indignity of being called \"George\" (the name of the company founder George Pullman) rather than by their own names.\n\nThe company was politically well connected, as Eugene Debs had learned the hard way in 1894, when he led a strike of railway workers that was crushed by federal and state troops. Soon after Randolph and others announced the formation of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the company fired union members, threatened workers with tougher or fewer assignments if they showed any pro-union sentiments, and branded Randolph as a Bolshevik.\n\nRandolph worked tirelessly to organize workers and combat the company's union busting, traveling across the country, meeting with porters, and trying to keep the organization together with limited funds and outside support. The Messenger became the union's official publication, but Randolph also generated publicity for the union in black newspapers and in some radical publications. Randolph became the public face of the organization, drawing on a core of activist porters as his key organizers, as depicted in the 2002 film, \" 10,000 Men Named George ,\" starring Andre Braugher as Randolph.\n\nThe porters admired Randolph's hard work and integrity, but for almost ten years the BSCP had little to show for Randolph's efforts. The New Deal changed the odds. Amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934 gave railroad workers the right to unionize. The next year, Randolph persuaded a vast majority of porters to endorse the BSCP as their collective voice in negotiations with Pullman. That year, the AFL voted to grant an international charter to the BSCP. After two more years of difficult negotiations, the Pullman Company finally signed a contract with the BSCP in1937, a major milestone.\n\nRandolph's goal was not simply to build a union of porters but, rather, to promote the idea of trade unionism to skeptical black workers. He also sought to persuade the white labor leadership that black workers deserved their support and should be part of union drives in every industry in which they toiled. Randolph later recalled:\n\nThere was no other group of Negroes in America who constituted the key to unlocking the door of a nationwide struggle for Negro rights as the porters. Without the porters I couldn't have carried on the fight for fair employment, or the fight against discrimination in the armed forces.\n\nRandolph's national stature as a black leader was further enhanced in 1936 when he was drafted to serve as president of a new organization, the National Negro Congress (NNC), made up of about two hundred black groups. Its goal was to build a mass movement of blacks, mostly by working through labor unions but also by promoting civil rights.\n\nSeveral key Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) unions backed the new organization, and the NNC provided support for several union campaigns, encouraging black workers to join the industrial union movement. But Randolph soon realized that many of NNC's key union supporters were Communists who expected the NNC to support Communist Party positions on foreign policy matters - including unquestioning support of the Soviet Union, of which Randolph was critical. Randolph had been outmaneuvered. In 1940 Randolph resigned from the NNC but kept his position with the BSCP.\n\nBy then Randolph was an important figure in the black community. Still a socialist, still dedicated to the labor movement, and still a crusader for civil rights, Randolph embarked on what some friends told him was an impossible task: to get the president to end racial discrimination in the defense industry and desegregate the US military.\n\nThe boom in defense spending in anticipation of US entry into World War II created good jobs for white workers but not for blacks. In 1940, only 240 out of 107,000 workers in the aircraft industry were black. Even where they were hired, they were consigned to the worst jobs.\n\nSimilarly, there were only 4,700 blacks among the US Army's half a million soldiers. Only one of the Army's four Negro units was being trained for combat. There were no blacks in the US Marines, the Tank Corps, the Signal Corps, or the Army Air Corps. Blacks were often trained in segregated camps and were almost always assigned support duties - digging ditches, building roads, cooking and serving meals. Even the Red Cross blood supply was segregated.\n\nAfter hearing Randolph speak about these issues, Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for Randolph, Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League to meet with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on September 27, 1940. Roosevelt listened but did not make any promises. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox argued that white sailors would never accept blacks as equals on the same ship. Roosevelt's chief military and cabinet advisers opposed integration.\n\nAngered by Roosevelt's indifference, Randolph formulated a plan and came up with a slogan: \"We loyal Negro Americans demand the right to work and fight for our country.\" He set up a National March on Washington Committee. He enlisted the NAACP, the Urban League, the porters, and black newspapers to spread the word. They set a date for the march: July 1, 1941.\n\nRoosevelt was informed about the proposed march but refused to schedule another meeting with Randolph to discuss it. Randolph kept the heat on, writing Roosevelt letters demanding a meeting. At that point, Roosevelt asked Eleanor to contact her friend Randolph and ask him to cancel the march. Randolph refused, and Roosevelt eventually agreed to another meeting.\n\nOn June 18, 1941, Randolph and White sat down with Roosevelt at the White House. They reminded the president that the nation was gearing up for World War II, but that African Americans were consistently being excluded from well-paying jobs with private defense contractors. The two civil rights leaders wanted the commander in chief to open up defense employment to blacks. If not, the march was on. Randolph looked Roosevelt in the eye and told him, \"Time is running out. We want something concrete, something tangible, positive and affirmative.\"\n\n\"How many people do you plan to bring?\" Roosevelt asked him. \"One hundred thousand, Mr. President,\" Randolph responded. This figure staggered and frightened the president. Roosevelt then turned to White. \"Walter, how many people will really march?\" Roosevelt asked. \"One hundred thousand, Mr. President,\" White said without hesitation.\n\nRoosevelt relented. A week later, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, which Randolph had helped draft. It stated, \"There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.\" The order also created a Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to investigate reports of discrimination. Randolph called off the march. The headline in the New York Times on June 26, 1941 read: \"President Orders An Even Break for Minorities in Defense Jobs.\"\n\nRandolph may have been bluffing. Could he have pulled off the threatened march of one hundred thousand African Americans? It's not certain, but if anyone in America could have, it would have been Randolph, and that is what Roosevelt feared. At the time, Randolph was the most effective African-American organizer in the country. He was a powerful voice for civil rights and had important allies among liberals, progressives, and radicals.\n\nThe FEPC did not live up to Randolph's expectations. Discrimination in wages and seniority persisted in the defense industry. The armed services remained segregated. As blacks migrated to northern cities to take the worst jobs in the defense plants, they encountered racism from whites at work and in the housing market. Nevertheless, weak though it was, the FEPC marked the beginning of federal efforts to end racial discrimination in employment. Future efforts would build on this foundation.\n\nAlthough Roosevelt had promised much more than he delivered, Randolph - and the American left - had learned valuable lessons about power and about organizing. Whether or not he was bluffing, Randolph faced down the president with the threat of mass movement, and Roosevelt reluctantly agreed to Randolph's demands.\n\nIn 1948 Randolph not only again threatened mass protest if President Harry S. Truman failed to order an end to segregation in the military, but this time he also urged black men to resist the draft until the president relented. He led pickets at that year's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to embarrass Truman. Truman was furious, but that July he signed an executive order to integrate the armed forces and federal civil service jobs.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, '50s and '60s, Randolph kept pushing on both the labor and civil rights fronts. He traveled around the country, speaking at college campuses, union halls, churches, and street meetings, building support for a society that could provide decent jobs and equal treatment for all Americans.\n\nHis protégés played key roles in challenging America's economic class and racial caste system. In 1941, Randolph hired twenty-nine-year-old Bayard Rustin to lead the youth wing of the March on Washington movement. Rustin was disappointed when Randolph called off the threatened march, concerned that it would take years for Roosevelt's order to be enforced. But working with Randolph, Rustin learned tools that he would employ for the next three decades as a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr and an influential advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience.\n\nIn 1945, Randolph spoke at Morehouse College, where King was a freshman. Randolph predicted that the near future would witness a global struggle that would end white supremacy and capitalism. He urged the students to link up with \"the people in the shacks and the hovels,\" who, although \"poor in property,\" were \"rich in spirit.\" It was an eye-opening moment for the sixteen-year old King.\n\nIn 1955, after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to move to the black section of a segregated bus in Montgomery, one of Randolph's protégés - E. D. Nixon, a leader of the BSCP, the head of the Alabama NAACP, and the president of the Montgomery Voters League - became the key behind-the-scenes organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott. Parks had worked as Nixon's assistant in the local NAACP office and was well known and respected in the black community, which made her arrest the perfect catalyst for the boycott. Nixon recruited the twenty-six-year-old King - then a newly arrived minister in town - to become the boycott's public face.\n\nThat year, Randolph became a vice president of the AFL-CIO's Executive Council, and in 1959 he helped found the Negro American Labor Council. For the next several years, he endeavored to foster the burgeoning civil rights movement and link it with the labor movement.\n\nIn 1963 the movement was gathering momentum, but the various civil rights organizations competed for attention and funding. Randolph pulled them together - along with the leaders of major labor, liberal, and religious organizations - and laid out his idea for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The march would push for federal legislation, including an increase in the minimum wage and the Civil Rights Act, which President John F. Kennedy had proposed but which was stalled in Congress. Kennedy tried to dissuade the leaders from sponsoring the march, contending that it would undermine support for the legislation. But Randolph had faced down presidents before, and he did so again.\n\nRandolph hired Rustin to serve as the march's day-to-day organizer. Some civil rights leaders objected because Rustin was gay, fearing that his involvement would discredit the civil rights movement, but Randolph would not back down, insisting that it had to be Rustin. Thus appointed, Rustin pulled together a staff and organized all the logistics.\n\nThe August 28, 1963 march attracted over 250,000 participants - the largest protest march in American history at the time. The march is best known as the setting of King's \" I Have a Dream \" speech, but it was Randolph who gave the first oration at the Lincoln Memorial that included this message:\n\nLet the nation and the world know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group, we are not an organization or a group of organizations, we are not a mob. We are the advanced guard of a massive, moral revolution for jobs and freedom. . . .\n\nBut this civil rights revolution is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they cannot be free while we are not. And we know that we have no future in a society in which six million black and white people are unemployed and millions more live in poverty. . . .\n\nWe want a free, democratic society dedicated to the political, economic and social advancement of man along moral lines. . . . We know that real freedom will require many changes in the nation's political and social philosophies and institutions. For one thing we must destroy the notion that Mrs. Murphy's property rights include the right to humiliate me because of the color of my skin. The sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality. . . .\n\nThe plain and simple fact is that until we went into the streets the federal government was indifferent to our demands. It was not until the streets and jails of Birmingham were filled that Congress began to think about civil rights legislation. It was not until thousands demonstrated in the South that lunch counters and other public accommodations were integrated.\n\nA photograph of Randolph and Rustin at the Lincoln Memorial graced the cover of LIFE magazine's September 6, 1963 issue.\n\nThe march - along with ongoing organizing efforts in Southern cities - paved the way for passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the first major civil rights legislation bill since the Reconstruction era. That year, President Lyndon Johnson awarded Randolph the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his activist career.\n\nBut that didn't stop Randolph from criticizing Johnson. In the late 1960s, as Johnson's Great Society anti-poverty programs stalled because of the rising cost of the Vietnam War, Randolph led a coalition of progressives to propose a Freedom Budget for the nation, calling for spending $185 billion ($1.6 trillion in today's dollars) over ten years to fight poverty.\n\nThe proposal was cowritten with Rustin, with the forward written by King. In a clear testament to Randolph's ideological influence, King wrote:\n\nWe shall eliminate slums for Negroes when we destroy ghettos and build new cities for all. We shall eliminate unemployment for Negroes when we demand full and fair employment for all. We shall produce an educated and skilled Negro mass when we achieve a twentieth century education system for all.\n\nRandolph retired in 1968 and lived quietly in New York City. His health deteriorated, and he died at the age of 90 in 1979.\n\nRandolph never gave up his socialist belief that unions and their members, regardless of race, are key to the struggle to redistribute society's wealth, provide good jobs for all, and create a more democratic society. And he persisted in his belief that strategic mass action by a coalition of liberal, progressive, and radical forces is central to making America live up to its ideals.\n\nThe millions of people who benefit today from his contributions to the civil rights and labor movements should know his name.\n\nPeter Dreier teaches political science at Occidental College.

But the percentage of black workers in manufacturing has been halved since the 1970s, yielding poverty and precarity. We can't achieve racial justice without a movement to win those jobs back.\n\nWorkers in an auto repair shop in 1969. (George W. Hales / Fox Photos / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs we face a global crisis in logistics, supply chains and manufacturing capacity have become impossible to ignore. Suddenly these topics are all over US political discourse, prompting even mainstream news outlets to begin to question the legacy of globalization and deindustrialization.\n\nBut while current crises have turned up the volume, the discussion about the decline of US manufacturing employment was already underway. A defining feature of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was a critique, however incoherent, of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and deindustrialization. That focus was arguably a major reason for his success.\n\nSince Trump's election, our major media institutions have mostly explored the loss of unionized, blue-collar manufacturing jobs as part of a broader attempt to understand the social and political angst of the so-called \"white working class.\" In this worldview, the future of blue-collar work is only of concern to white men. MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid expressed this idea when she described President Joe Biden's Build Back Better legislation as a \"white guy employment act.\"\n\nLost in this conversation is the tremendous harm that deindustrialization has wrought on working-class black communities, and how fundamentally important private sector unions were - and still are - in the building of a stable, blue-collar black middle class.\n\nAn excellent recent study titled \" The Unmaking of the Black Blue-Collar Middle Class ,\" coauthored by William Lazonick, Philip Moss, and Joshua Weitz, begins to set the record straight. The study tracks the emergence and decline of black employment in major unionized industries like steel, auto, electrical, and rubber.\n\nThe destruction of these union jobs has been a critical factor in accelerating the precarity that is common for so many working-class black people. Racial inequality in the United States cannot be addressed in any meaningful way unless we deal with this fundamental issue.\n\nThe entry of black workers into the major industrial labor unions was difficult and uneven. Employers routinely took advantage of many unions' discriminatory practices by using black workers as strikebreakers, which served to further weaken the prospects of broad interracial working-class solidarity.\n\nHowever, the explosive emergence of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s presented new opportunities. Black workers played major roles in unionization efforts and gained tentative footholds in mass production industries such as meatpacking , auto, electrical, and more.\n\nThe combination of World War II production demands and civil rights organizing produced further gains. Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters leader A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington movement successfully forced the creation of the Fair Employment Practices Committee, which was tasked with eliminating racial discrimination in wartime industries. The results were limited but meaningful.\n\nThe percentage of black workers in war production rose from 2.5 percent to 8 percent from March 1942 to November 1944. In a four-year period from April 1940 to April 1944, the employment of black men in the US civilian labor force jumped from 2.9 million to 3.8 million, and for black women 1.5 million to 2.1 million.\n\nHowever, this progress was frustrated as the wartime industries demobilized.\n\nA later surge in industrial employment for black workers was enabled by the parallel dynamics of a powerful labor-civil rights coalition and economic growth.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy signed the federal initiative Plans for Progress in 1961, which strengthened oversight of employment discrimination with federal contractors. By the time of the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the \"Big Three\" automobile companies (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) had signed Plans for Progress and committed to affirmative-action hiring of black workers. Following the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1965, federal inspections became routine and helped to enforce this pledge.\n\nLabor scholar Herbert R. Northrup, in his work The Negro in the Automobile Industry , explains the fortunate timing of this civil rights legislation:\n\nThe rise in civil rights emphasis in the 1960s, by a happy coincidence, came at a time of great prosperity in the automobile industry. Moreover, it happened when a natural turnover was occurring in the industry. Many employees hired around World War II, or earlier, were seeking retirement under the liberalized early and regular retirement programs in the industry. . . . The need for Negroes to obtain jobs and the need of an industry for new workers were never better coordinated.\n\nBy the mid-1960s the auto industry was the second-largest employer of black semiskilled production workers, surpassing one hundred thousand in 1966. These jobs had among the highest wages and best benefits packages in the country. In short, these jobs were fundamental to creating middle-class living standards for blue-collar black workers without college degrees.\n\nAs Lazonick, Moss, and Weitz observe:\n\nMost of these workers had no more than high-school educations but had sufficient earnings and benefits to provide their families with economic security, including realistic expectations that over the coming decades their children would have the opportunity to move up the economic ladder to join the ranks of the college-educated white-collar middle class.\n\nThis all occurred at a time when the auto industry was experiencing a period of rapid growth. For example, between 1961 and 1966 total employment at the \"Big Three\" ballooned from 693,186 to 953,585.\n\nContrary to persistent and misguided stereotypes about the racial demographics of union membership, the above-mentioned dynamics led to the overrepresentation of black workers in the union movement. By the early 1980s, black workers were 9.2 percent of the total labor force, but 14.2 percent of auto workers and 13.7 percent of union members.\n\nSimilar trends in black employment occurred in other manufacturing industries such as steel and consumer electronics. By 1966, the steel industry had become one of the largest employers of black male manufacturing workers.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement was keenly aware of the possibilities that these dynamics unleashed. It was during this same period that movement leaders like A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Martin Luther King, Jr launched the \" Freedom Budget\" for all Americans .\n\nThe vision came out of a basic understanding that civil rights gains would be rendered largely meaningless if black people continued to remain at the bottom rung of the economic system. After winning the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, an immediate pivot toward addressing issues of systemic poverty would be needed.\n\nThe program of the Freedom Budget amounted to a social democratic transformation of US society, with good union jobs at the center. It called for full employment through the creation of jobs in areas of social need such as housing construction, public school construction, environmental remediation, and all manner of public works projects.\n\nBayard Rustin envisioned an economic mobilization on the scale of World War II, writing in a 1968 book titled The Anatomy of Frustration:\n\nIn World War II we did not ask whether people were too black, or too old, or too young, or too stupid to work. We simply said to them this is a hammer, this is a tool, this is a drill. We built factories and sent these people into the factories. We paid them extraordinarily good wages and in two months they created the miracle of making planes that flew. We can find a peacetime method for doing this.\n\nThis vision was not merely a pipe dream. It was inspired by the very tangible gains black workers had already made in both overall manufacturing employment and the labor movement.\n\nThe defeat of both the Freedom Budget and the social democratic tendency in US politics forestalled the possibility of building on the progress black workers had made in the 1960s. As long as major investment decisions remained in the hands of capital, postwar economic gains would remain precarious.\n\nAs countries that had been destroyed during World War II began to recover and compete economically with the United States, the postwar settlement began to unravel. For black workers, the rise of the Japanese manufacturing industry and the response by their US counterparts was particularly decisive.\n\nAs Japanese companies in steel, auto, electronics, and tires became more productive, US companies tried to compete by cutting wages and laying off workers. Black workers were hit the hardest. Even so, the presence of unions, especially in the auto industry, helped stop the bleeding.\n\nAs the authors of \"The Unmaking of the Black Blue-Collar Middle Class\" explain, \"Management-union agreements also gave priority to recently laid-off employees when staffing new plants. These agreements dampened the negative impact of plant relocation on many black auto workers.\" But this only offered marginal relief from a long-term downward trend.\n\nWorse still, Japanese auto companies deliberately avoided urban areas with large black populations when locating to the United States. This virtually shut out black workers from reaping any economic benefits from these industrial transformations. As the study explains:\n\nThus, in a key mass-production industry in the 1980s, blacks lost their jobs in unionized plants while they were largely excluded from participating in the new middle class blue-collar employment opportunities being offered by the Japanese transplants.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the auto industry experienced a short-term recovery, and black employment reached a high of 168,000 in 1986. But since then, the industry has only been in steep decline. In 2009, black workers had under 60,000 jobs in the auto industry, just 33 percent of its peak level in 1978. In manufacturing overall, the percentage of black workers dropped from 23 percent in 1979 to just 10 percent in 2007.\n\nFor many black communities, these once-stable union jobs have been replaced by grinding poverty, unemployment, and mass incarceration.\n\nThe chatter in political circles about racial justice has become ever more frantic, and yet at the same time increasingly unmoored from the underlying economic conditions of most black people's lives. These conditions are only getting more abysmal. As we experience crippling inflation and stare down the barrel of a Federal Reserve-induced recession , the situation has become dire for all workers.\n\nIf the Left is serious about fighting racial inequality, then it needs to make the issue of family-sustaining union jobs in both the public and private sector a central priority. Efforts to rebuild the US industrial manufacturing base will need to be a component of this.\n\nA worker-centered Green New Deal offers an opportunity to expand blue-collar manufacturing employment in an environmentally sustainable way. The needs in building public transit, retrofitting buildings, the expansion of clean energy, and much more are vast. Even just maintaining and improving existing infrastructure like roads and bridges is long overdue.\n\nPursuing these projects also offers the opportunity to massively expand building trades apprenticeship programs and include more workers of color. Campaigns to fully fund robust Career Technical Education programs in every public school are the kinds of initiatives we can envision.\n\nThere are still many existing private sector union fights that heavily involve black workers. The logistics industry is huge, ever-growing, and diverse. We don't make much stuff in this country anymore, but we sure do move a lot of it. United Parcel Service (UPS) is the largest private sector employer in the country, employing over 340,000 unionized workers represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The UPS contract expires in August 2023, and a central goal of the union is to raise the standards for the disproportionately black and brown part-time workforce .\n\nAs \"The Unmaking of the Black Blue-Collar Middle Class\" demonstrates, labor unions have been instrumental in creating stability for non-college-educated working-class black people. Any strategy for racial justice that does not fight for full employment and a strong labor movement is not worthy of the name.\n\nPaul Prescod is an organizer with Teamsters for a Democratic Union and Jacobin contributing editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Black Men Are Pushed to Pursue Sports. Why Not Medicine?\n\nFormer NFL player Nate Hughes, shown here in 2009, recently became a physician. Gray Quetti/Cal Sport/ZUMA\n\nThis story was originally published by Undark and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nAaron Bolds didn't consider becoming a physician until he tore a ligament in his knee while playing in a basketball tournament when he was 15. His orthopedic surgeon was Black, and they hit it off. \"He was asking me how my grades were, and I told him, 'I'm a straight-A student,' and he was, like, 'Man, this is a great fallback plan if basketball doesn't work out,'\" recalls Bolds, who is African American.\n\n\"He looked like me,\" Bolds says, \"and that was even more encouraging.\"\n\nIf not for that chance encounter, Bolds, 34, a doctor at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, might never have gone into medicine, he says. When he was growing up, there were no physicians in his family or extended social network to model that career path. And at the schools he attended, he says, his aptitude for science didn't trigger the kind of guidance young people often receive in more privileged contexts.\n\nWhat Bolds did get attention for was his athletic ability. He got a full basketball scholarship to Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, where his team won a conference championship. But when he transferred to Bowie State University in Maryland, where he also played basketball, an academic adviser discouraged his pre-med ambitions, Bolds recalls, saying his grades were low and he lacked research experience.\n\nBolds is not alone in finding in athletics a fraught lever of educational opportunity. Whereas Black players comprise more than half the football and basketball teams at the 65 universities in the top five athletic conferences, and bring in millions of dollars for their schools year after year, the graduation rates for Black male college athletes are significantly lower-55 percent as compared to 69 percent for college athletes overall-according to a 2018 report from the USC Race and Equity Center. Many Black college athletes end up without either a professional sports contract or a clear career path.\n\nNow some educators and advocates are looking to reverse this trend by connecting sports, an area in which African American men are overrepresented, and medicine, where the opposite is true. As of 2018, 13 percent of the U.S. population, but just 5 percent of doctors- according to the Association of American Medical Colleges-identified as Black or African American. (The AAMC data notes that an additional 1 percent of doctors identified as multiracial.) Decades of efforts to increase diversity at medical schools have made progress with other demographics, including Black women-but barely any with Black men. \"No other demographic group is broken down with such a large split between men and women,\" says Jo Wiederhorn, president and CEO of the Associated Medical Schools of New York. \"And none of them have stayed stagnant, like that group has.\"\n\nAccording to data the AAMC provided to Undark , the proportion of Black men enrolling in medical school hasn't changed much since 1978-with only some headway being made in the past few years.\n\nThe absence of Black male medical professionals ripples across the health system, experts say, contributing to widespread health disparities. African Americans tend to be diagnosed later than White people with everything from cancer to kidney disease , leading to more advanced disease and earlier deaths . Meanwhile, a recent study suggests that Black men who see Black male doctors may be more likely to follow medical advice. Other research also suggests that racially concordant care, in which patients and doctors have a shared identity, is associated with better communication and a greater likelihood to use health services.\n\n\"We are in a crisis point, nationally,\" says Reginald Miller, the dean for research operations and infrastructure at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"I don't think it's a stretch to suggest that the health of communities of color are directly proportional to the number of practitioners available to see,\" he says. \"It's just that straightforward.\"\n\nLast year, the National Medical Association, a professional organization representing African American physicians, embarked with the AAMC on a joint effort to address the structural barriers to advancement for Black men. \"We need to look at this with a unique lens,\" says Norma Poll-Hunter, senior director of workforce diversity at the AAMC.\n\nThere is no single solution to such an entrenched and multifaceted problem, Poll-Hunter says. According to her, some medical schools have adopted a holistic admissions process that evaluates many personal factors rather than relying on standardized test scores, which can exclude promising Black candidates. In addition, she says, students of color need better access to high-quality K-12 science education, particularly in under-resourced public schools. \"There are a lot of barriers that exist early on,\" she notes, \"and that then creates this narrowing of the pathway to medicine.\"\n\nBut the novel strategy of wooing athletes is slowly gaining traction. Advocates point out that high-performing athletes possess many of the skills and attributes that doctors, psychologists, physical therapists, and other medical professionals need-things like focus, a commitment to excellence, time management, and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to take constructive criticism and perform under pressure.\n\n\"When you say, 'What's your ideal medical student?' it's not just a kid who's academically gifted. It's a kid who's got resilience, attention to detail, knows how to work on the team,\" Miller says. \"Because science and medicine are team sports.\" And by virtue of being athletes, these young men are already attuned to nutrition, fitness, and other aspects of human biology.\n\nTwo former NFL players, Nate Hughes and Myron Rolle, recently became physicians. And there is evidence that competitive sports experience contributes to medical success. A 2012 study of doctors training to become ear, nose, and throat specialists at Washington University, for example, found that having excelled in a team sport was more predictive of how faculty rated their quality as a clinician than strong letters of recommendation or having attended a highly-ranked medical school. Likewise, a 2011 study found that having an elite skill, such as high-achieving athletics, was more predictive of completing a general surgery residency than medical school grades.\n\nAdvocates of the athletics-to-medicine pipeline point out its practicality. Thousands of Black men are already in college, or headed there, on athletic scholarships. It would only take a small percentage of them choosing medical careers to boost the percentage of Black male doctors to better reflect the proportion of African American men in the general population, they say.\n\nNo one thinks it will be easy. One obstacle, advocates say, is a lack of role models. Black sports celebrities are household names, but some young athletes may never encounter a Black medical professional. \"People don't believe they can become what they don't see,\" says Mark R. Brown, the athletic director at Pace University.\n\nAnd for the best chance of success, many say, these young men need to form and pursue medical aspirations as young as possible, along with their athletic training. \"Those kids who are able to do both, the rewards at the end are enormous,\" Miller says. But the adults in their lives may not believe the dual path is possible. \"The second that a kid says to a science teacher or someone else that he's an athlete,\" Miller says, \"they go into a different category. 'They're not really serious about science and medicine, they're just here, and so I don't expect this kid to really achieve.'\"\n\nRigid course and practice schedules also make it challenging for busy athletes to undertake demanding and time-intensive science majors, observers say. What's needed is \"a cultural change, and not just a cultural change with the athletes. It's a cultural change with the whole structure,\" Miller says. \"Everybody's excited about the idea\" of the physician athlete, he adds, \"because it makes sense. But when the rubber hits the road, it is challenging.\"\n\nDonovan Roy, the assistant dean for diversity and inclusiveness at Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine at Western Michigan University, was one of the first people to envision the potential of directing Black athletes toward medical careers.\n\nRoy, 48, who is Black and a former college football player, grew up in the working class, primarily Black and Latino community of Inglewood, California. Attending an elite private high school on a football scholarship was eye-opening. He vividly remembers the first time he ever saw a walk-in pantry, at a friend's home. \"It was stocked like a convenience store,\" he recalls. \"Five different types of Hostess, Ding-Dongs, sodas, every type of snack that you ever wanted.\" Equally startling was speaking with another friend's mother, who was a lawyer. \"I'd never seen a road map to success in my community,\" he says.\n\nRoy's athletic talent continued to open doors-at 18 he got a scholarship to the University of Southern California-but poorly prepared by the under-resourced public schools he had attended through ninth grade, he struggled academically, and left both USC and later another university that he also attended on an athletic scholarship.\n\nEventually Roy found his footing, and when he did, he became a learning specialist. After working through his own academic struggles, he wanted to help others with theirs. Roy took a job as a learning skills counselor at UCLA's medical school. There he helped the students who were struggling with classes like anatomy and genetics. In early 2015, he returned to USC as the director of academic support services at Keck School of Medicine.\n\nSomething Roy noticed at both these medical schools stuck with him, though it would take a few years for the observation to crystallize. A certain kind of student sought help despite, by ordinary standards, not needing it. These were the athletes, and many of them were Black or Latino. \"They always talked about, 'How can I excel? How can I get better?'\" he recalls. They \"were getting 90s and they wanted to be 100.\"\n\nRoy began a doctoral program in education in 2015, the same year the AAMC published a damning report about the lack of Black men entering medical school. This was a crisis Roy understood both personally and professionally. For his dissertation, he decided to interview 16 Black male students at Keck School of Medicine. What was it about them, he wanted to understand, that had gotten them there against all odds?\n\nThe answer, he discovered, was what academics call social capital. For medical students from privileged backgrounds, social capital might take the form of a family friend who arranges a summer internship at a biotechnology lab, or a well-funded high school that offers advanced placement science classes. The young men Roy interviewed did not, for the most part, have access to those sorts of resources.\n\n\"Growing up, I didn't see a Black male with a college degree until I got to college,\" medical student Jai Kemp said in a separate interview Roy conducted for a documentary he's making on the topic. The social capital these young men leveraged to get to medical school took the form of parental support, science enrichment programs and clubs, peer social networks, faculty mentors-and the perks that come with athletics. \"For me it was just sports that got me through,\" Kemp said.\n\nThe pieces started to fit together. Roy knew from his own experience all the benefits athletes get, not just entrée to educational institutions, but travel, enrichment, and academic advantages like tutoring and early class registration. Athletes also tend to possess social cachet on campus and, with more exposure to different types of people, may feel comfortable in environments that seem foreign and forbidding to other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Roy also recalled the drive for academic excellence he had observed in the athletes who came to his tutoring programs. \"I got this epiphany,\" he says. \"Why don't we look at student athletes in order to increase Black males' representation in medicine, because they have the most social capital and the most network on predominantly White campuses.\"\n\nBut when Roy began talking to his medical school colleagues about recruiting athletes, who according to a report from the Center for American Progress-a liberal think tank-make up 16 percent of Black male college students receiving athletic aid in the Big 12 athletic conference, he says most weren't receptive to the idea. The same thing happened when he got up the nerve to make the suggestion publicly at a 2018 conference in Orlando, Florida. The idea ran against type. \"I think people tend to lump athletes into this box,\" he says. \"They just think that athletes are big meatheads.\"\n\nRoy knew this truth viscerally, because with his offensive lineman's build of 6-feet-6-inches and 300-plus pounds, he sticks out in academic settings. \"People stare,\" he says. \"They do not expect me to be in the role that I am in.\"\n\nWhat Roy didn't know was that the idea was percolating elsewhere, including at the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Brian Hainline, the NCAA's chief medical officer, says he and Poll-Hunter of the AAMC are in talks with several universities about launching a pilot program to support African American athletes interested in medical careers.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2018 Miller founded the organization Scholar-Athletes with Academic Goals (a.k.a. SWAG , a name he hopes will resonate with young people). The initiative connects promising athletes with a range of available programs to help them pursue and succeed in science and medicine. Recently, Miller worked closely with leadership at Pace University to create a program, expected to launch next year, to support Black college athletes interested in attending medical school. Pace officials want the initiative to become a magnet for out-of-state athletes and a model for other schools. \"My hope is that two years from now, colleges and universities will call\" and ask, \"Wow, how did you do this?\" says athletic director Brown. \"Once we have some success, and proof of concept, then I think it can really grow.\"\n\nBolds graduated medical school in 2018 and is now doing his residency at Mount Sinai. His focus is rehabilitation medicine, and he plans to tend to injured athletes and serve as a team physician. He got a business degree while in medical school, and his long-term goal is to open his own interventional spine and sports medicine practice specializing in preventing and rehabilitating injuries in both athletes and non-athletes, as well as helping serious players enhance their performance.\n\nBut there were tough moments along the way, such as the encounter with that academic adviser, which Bolds says only served to motivate him. At the time, he thought, \"Wow, this person doesn't believe in me. So let me make them a believer,\" he recalls. \"That was, moving forward, really a turning point for me, honestly. Because I knew that people aren't going to believe in you unless you give them a reason to.\"\n\nBolds began to apply an athletic mindset to his pre-med classes. \"That same grind of having to get up, 5 a.m., get to the gym, get shots up before anybody gets there, to put in that extra time-I was doing that with my studies,\" he says. \"I would get to the library before anybody.\" Once Bolds turned his grades around, professors began to notice and help him, he says. Still, he says, his score on the MCAT, an entrance exam required by nearly all U.S. medical schools, was borderline. Instead of giving up, he attended multiple events at Howard University's medical school, where he met people who advocated for him. It was the only medical school he got into.\n\nWhereas Bolds had to bushwhack, he saw other Black students fall off the medical path-and his fellow Black teammates avoided it entirely. Many athletes find themselves enmeshed in a profit-making system that may not prioritize their education. The NCAA has been criticized in recent years for its long-standing policy which prohibits profit-sharing with college athletes-a policy that was only recently reversed under interim guidelines. Others have said that Black labor has been especially exploited.\n\nAs of 2014 reports, fewer than 2 percent of athletes in the NCAA will go on to play professionally. But for self-serving reasons, critics say, (Clemson University's football team, for example, made $77 million in average annual revenue from 2015 through 2017) universities often direct athletes to \"academic paths of least resistance.\" Many schools practice \" major clustering ,\" in which players are steered to the same relatively undemanding major, such as communications, so they can devote themselves almost entirely to their sport. Major clustering is more pronounced among athletes of color, according to a 2009 study of football teams at 11 universities. At six of those schools, the study found, over three-quarters of the non-White football players were enrolled in just two academic majors, although dozens of majors were offered.\n\nSheron Mark, an associate professor of science education at the University of Louisville, co-authored a 2019 case study of two young Black men who arrived at college on basketball scholarships, with the intent to pursue respective careers in computer science and engineering. But both found it difficult to balance academics with athletics because of pressure and blandishments from coaches and faculty advisers.\n\n\"For so long, they've been sold this message that you don't have many choices, that banking on a professional sports career is one of very few options for you if you want to advance your station in life,\" says Mark of many Black athletes. It's important to have a plan B, she says, since \"the odds just aren't in their favor.\" But coaches can discourage academically demanding majors because they may cut into practice time, and college athletes are not always capable of pushing back, she says, because their financial packages are tied to fulfillment of their team responsibilities.\n\nMany Black college athletes are already strong candidates for medical school, advocates say, but others may need extra academic support to compensate for deficits acquired at under-resourced K-12 schools. They may also need post-graduation training to take science classes they did not have time for while working long hours as athletes-with some working 20-plus hours a week. \"How are they being mentored and guided and protected in planning for their futures?\" Mark asks. \"They are high achieving in sports, they want to be high achieving in academics. Why don't we support them?\" When people wonder whether student-athletes can cut it in science and medicine, Mark's response is: \"It's on us. It's on us to help them do so. That's how we can grow their representation.\"\n\nThat's what Pace University intends to do. The school already nurtures academic success in its athletes, who collectively had a B+ average last school year, but premedical studies have never been a great fit, in part because afternoon practices can conflict with long lab classes, says athletic director Brown. As part of the school's new initiative, Pace science departments have pledged to offer flexibility in course section offerings in order to accommodate football commitments. Athletes of color from any sport will be welcome, but football was prioritized because it is the largest and one of the most diverse teams and has the most complicated schedule, Brown says.\n\nThe school also plans to adjust its advising, tutoring, and library services to ensure that pre-med athletes won't falter when they struggle with personal issues or tough classes like organic chemistry. \"Rather than saying, 'Oh, chemistry, nobody likes chemistry, you're right, you should just drop that,' instead now it's going to be, 'Yeah, you've got to buckle down. And here's how we're going to do it,'\" says Hillary Knepper, the university's associate provost for student success.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown will be directing his coaches to actively recruit Black and Latino high school athletes who are interested in medicine. In the past, Brown says, his coaches were less likely to select such students because of anticipated scheduling challenges. But now Pace is trying to establish a partnership through which a nearby medical school would give preferred consideration to pre-med athletes who have completed the Pace curriculum. \"With our new approach, you're not only going to have the ability to do it,\" he says, \"but you're going to have a support system, to make sure that you follow the path.\"\n\nSome advocates for the athlete-to-doctor paradigm see this work as part of the larger movement for social justice. \"Look what Jackie Robinson did, right? Look at Muhammad Ali, look at Colin Kaepernick,\" Roy says. \"Athletics has always been the vehicle for social change.\"\n\nMedical professionals can influence public policy, accumulate wealth, and help empower others in their orbit. \"The impacts ramp up really quickly, from just that individual benefiting,\" Mark says, to \"your family, your neighborhood, your social network, and society-people you won't even meet, and across generations.\"\n\nStudies suggest that African American doctors are more likely to choose to work in underserved communities. They also may be more attuned to, and motivated to combat, the disparities in health care . A study published last year, for example, suggests that Black newborns are half as likely to die when they are cared for by a Black physician.\n\nBolds is keenly aware of the health disparities for Black communities, and he jumps at opportunities to mentor other young Black men, to show them that they, too, can become doctors. \"It seems like there's so many steps that just are never-ending,\" he says. But, he adds, to see someone \"that you can connect with that's at that finish line or has already passed that finish line-I think that's very key to their success.\"\n\nOne of the people Bolds has connected with is Darius Ervin, a talented Black basketball player from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who is now a sophomore at Cornell University. The two met when Ervin attended a virtual event late last year, sponsored by SWAG, at which Bolds spoke. Afterwards, the two chatted, and Bolds now checks in periodically with Ervin, who says he appreciates the encouragement. \"Those are people that have once laced up shoes and got on the court and played just like how I did, and now they're in the hospital helping people,\" he says. \"Being able to speak to those people gives me the visual, allows me to see that it's an opportunity and it's definitely possible for me to do.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Are Successful Black Men Assumed to Be Athletes or Entertainers?\n\nOprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan in May 2011 Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nDuring a trip to Las Vegas, I arranged to interview a wealthy source in his fancy hotel suite. At the resort in question (and probably at all of them), there was a separate entrance to the area where the suites are located, with its own elevators that are off-limits to other guests. We shared the elevator with a fit, well-dressed young Black man, who smiled politely and said hello. Later, my source, who is white, told me the guy was for sure a pro athlete. \"I could tell,\" he said confidently.\n\nCould he, really? Based on the man's build, maybe it wasn't an outlandish assumption, but would he have assumed the same of a fit young white guy?\n\nThis actually happens a lot. I write about it in my book, Jackpot . The lead character in the chapter titled \"Thriving While Black\" is a successful Black business executive named Erwin Raphael. He's 56 now, like me, and still quite fit-unlike me. Back in the day, he was actually pretty good at basketball, he says, but he was equally good at chemistry, his college major, in which his professors didn't necessarily expect him to excel, he realized.\n\nNowadays, particularly in upscale settings, white people tend to assume he's a former professional athlete. Why else would a Black man be playing golf, for example, at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where it is said that one must plop down several hundred thousand dollars up front (the club won't disclose its fees) to be a member-if invited-and hefty monthly fees on top of that?\n\nAt that very club the day before we sat down to talk, a white member had spotted Raphael as he was getting ready to play a round. The man came over, all friendly, and asked Raphael whether he used to be an athlete. \"Now, there's a better than even chance that my physical appearance would justify this question,\" he admits. But \"the stereotype is that wealthy Black people are not creators of wealth.\"\n\nTo resist that cultural bias, he says, he usually responds to such an approach with something like, \"'Nope, not at all. I was quite the nerd'-and I am a certified, card-carrying nerd!\" On this particular occasion, he answered the man straightforwardly and was annoyed with himself afterward. \"I thought, Wow, you idiot ! He clearly assumed that the only reason you would get to be a member here is had you been an athlete.\"\n\nThat the athlete/entertainer wealth trope contains a hint of truth-the majority of Black American billionaires fall into those categories, for example-may be evidence of the constrained path to success that our society offers certain categories of people, even today. Black entrepreneurs and executives are overlooked by the majority culture, Raphael told me. He likes to ask his white business colleagues a question: \"I know it makes them uncomfortable but I want to prove a point. I say, 'In the last 12 months, how many of the people that you've invited to your home were Black?' The answer is almost always zero.\"\n\nHis point: Their Black work \"friends\" are in fact colleagues, not true friends, even though everyone might socialize over drinks after work on occasion. \"You don't see them as Black people,\" Raphael says. \"Where most white people see Black people are on TV or in the movies. And the ones who are successful, very rarely is it the professional, the businessman, the entrepreneur.\"\n\nAlthough Raphael's family was poor when he and his six siblings were growing up on the Caribbean island of Dominica, and later St. Croix, several siblings ended up being very successful. His brother Sam now owns a resort in Dominica, where guests regularly ask him how he made his money. \"The assumption is he must be a drug dealer or something,\" Raphael says. (Another Hollywood trope.) \"His going line is 'I grew up a coconut picker.' People don't walk into hotels and ask a white owner, 'How did you get your money?'\"\n\nI have an amateur musician friend , Mark Montgomery French, who is without question a card-carrying nerd. He also happens to be Black, six-foot-nine, and has zero interest in sports. Every week for the past three decades, since he reached adult height, Mark tells me in an email, \"a total stranger would ask me the same four-word question. It's practically a script.\"\n\nHe proceeds to write out the script:\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nMARK is standing on a street corner, minding his own business. Suddenly we see GENERIC EVERYPERSON approach him from the front, looking up at MARK's height in amazement, mouth opening in slo-mo as a question stumbles out of it.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (beatifically): Do you play basketball?\n\nMARK (neutral, but like so over this): No I do not.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (confused, with a hint of hostility): What? Why? If I were your height I'd play all the time! Yadda-yadda-yadda Michael Jordan yadda-yadda-yadda high school coach yadda-yadda-yadda basketball-specific reference that I assume you understand...\n\nMARK (totally checked out): Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's nice. Uh-huh.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (still rolling): Yadda-yadda-yadda Are your kids tall?\n\nFADE OUT\n\nMark has made a good living for himself as the creative director for various marketing and tech firms, where he is invariably the company's first Black creative director. At one job, he befriended a white colleague an inch taller than he is. \"None of the above has ever happened to him,\" Mark told me.\n\nBut \"the upside to people thinking I must be a rich ex-baller is that I receive MUCH less racial abuse than other Black people,\" he continued. \"I've gotten free food at restaurants, high fives from numerous drunken men at airport sports bars, and exceptional service at hotels, all because I look like I might have a high-priced attorney on retainer. Fame-even perceived fame due to skin color and height-is more potent than racism.\"\n\nGrowing up in St. Croix, Raphael told me, he was surrounded by successful Black role models, and that made him feel he could follow his dreams wherever they took him. Indeed, if you bother to look, these role models can be found in America, too. Yet despite the presence of Black entrepreneurs and businesspeople; brilliant authors, scholars, scientists, and inventors; doctors, diplomats, lawyers and judges; successful Black people remain \"under-indexed\" in America, notes Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation.\n\nWalker, who is Black, grew up in rural Texas, where his family lived on the knife-edge of poverty, and bill collectors would come around to hound his hard-working single mother. Walker managed to escape the same plight, achieve tremendous success, and help take care of relatives who couldn't. White people cite his success, he told me, to show that anyone in America can overcome adversity and rise up. But that's apocryphal. Walker knows from experience that stories like his are, in fact, exceedingly rare-and that the way America's majority culture perceives Black people remains a barrier, psychological and practical, to upward mobility. Our misguided racial narratives, he says, contribute \"to the lack of achievement and the collective sense of limitations.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Race Gap in US Prisons Is Glaring, and Poverty Is Making it Worse\n\nPrisoners line up to vote at the D.C. Jail in Washington, DC. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nThe American criminal justice system's glaring racial disparities are well known: Black people make up nearly 40 percent of America's incarcerated population and are more than five times as likely as whites to be behind bars. A new paper from the People's Policy Project, a progressive think tank, looks at how economic inequality exacerbates this longstanding racial divide.\n\nUsing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, which has tracked a representative sample of Americans since the mid-'90s, Nathaniel Lewis finds that the incarceration gap between blacks and whites is primarily driven by economic disparities. He concludes that one's class, more than race, is the single greatest predictor of how likely someone is to land behind bars. Our jails and prisons are mostly filled with America's poor. ( In 2014 , 57 percent of incarcerated men, and 72 percent of incarcerated women had incomes below $22,500 before they were locked away.) Many of them are white, but a stunningly disproportionate share are black.\n\nAs Americans move up the class ladder, their odds of being incarcerated start to drop dramatically. White men in the lowest income quintile have a more than 40 percent probability of ever having been jailed, Lewis finds. In contrast, the probability for white men at the highest income level is 9 percent. Since black people are far likelier to be impoverished or low-income, they're also far likelier to be locked up. The probability that a low-income black man has been jailed is around 52 percent; for an upper-income black man it's 14 percent.\n\nThe roots of black folks' economic disadvantages run deep . Across nearly every measure of economic well-being, black Americans remain years, even decades, behind their white counterparts. The racial wealth gap alone has yawned to point where the black families would need over two centuries to catch up with the wealth amassed by white families. The following chart illustrates the slice of black and white men in each income group, as divided into quintiles. Black men, for example, are more than twice as likely to be in the lowest income quintile than white men; and white men are more than twice as likely to be in the highest.\n\nTo test his thesis, Lewis crafted a counterfactual in which there are no economic differences between white and black men. By taking class out of the picture, we can actually see more clearly how class drives these outcomes in the first place. Once class is removed, the black-white incarceration gap begins to vanish, though never entirely. Lewis calculates that class explains more than half of the difference between the share of black and white men who have been jailed for more than a year, and explains 85 percent of the gap between those who had been jailed after arrest. In other words, if economic background had played no role, far fewer poor black men would be imprisoned.\n\nThe paper does not argue that eradicating economic inequality will vanquish racism or the racism that infects the criminal justice system. What it does argue, in the tradition of scholars like Cedric Johnson , is that the criminal justice system isn't a standalone widget but a piece of a much larger machine. In order to reverse the stunning rate of black incarceration, Lewis finds, we have to address the poverty that pushes so many black people into prison in the first place. He concludes, \"[T]hese disparities are primarily driven by our racialized class system. Therefore, the most effective criminal justice reform may be an egalitarian economic program aimed at flattening the material differences between the classes.\" In other words, while building a more progressive economy won't end the horrors of racism, it may be the pathway to a less discriminatory criminal justice system.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "11 More Things You Can't Do While Black (or Brown)\n\nA protest outside the Starbucks where two black men were arrested last month while awaiting a business partner. Tom Gralish/Philadelphia Inquirer/AP\n\nThe latest addition to the list of things you apparently can't do while black is a doozy.\n\nOn Monday, a white graduate student at Yale called campus police on a black classmate who was sleeping on a sofa in the common room of the building where both students lived-Lolade Siyonbola, a grad student in Yale's African studies program, had fallen asleep while studying.\n\nSiyonbola was detained for more than 15 minutes as officers tried to verify she was a student. The spelling of her name on her student ID apparently didn't match the spelling in the database the officers used to look her up-which is really not all that surprising. Afterward, she posted two videos of the ordeal to Facebook. In one of them (below), which has hundreds of thousands of views, an officer asks for her ID. Siyonbola asks why, and another cop says they need to \"make sure you belong here.\"\n\n\"I deserve to be here. I paid tuition like everybody else. I am not going to justify my existence here,\" Siyonbola protests later after one of the officers asks about the assignment she was working on. After a bit more back and forth, she adds, \"I'm not going to be harassed.\"\n\nWhen they finally let her be, one of the officers tells Siyonbola to have a good night. \"I'm not going to have a good night,\" she says. \"But you have a good night.\"\n\nSiyonbola also informed the officers that the woman who called her in had previously called the police on her friend \"because he was black and in the stairwell.\"\n\nStuff like this happens every day in America: Black and brown Americans are unfairly perceived as suspicious or threatening by store clerks, restaurant managers, cops, and everyday people-who are often quick to call in law enforcement over behavior that is legal and/or benign.\n\nHere are 10 additions-since the mid-April arrests of two law-abiding men at a Philadelphia Starbucks-to the list of things you apparently can't do while black or brown:\n\nIf that's not enough for you, here are 21 previous examples compiled by a former colleague.

      "text": "The Most Loyal Trump Official Is Actually a Black Woman\n\n\"You have not been the kindest journalist to me,\" Lynne Patton told me over the phone. I could not argue with that: In reporting on her rise from Trump family aide to a key offic­ial at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I've covered her one-month stay in public housing and her Instagram post scoffing at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Yet as I watched Patton with fascination, what I really wanted to know was this: Is the most prominent black woman in the Trump administration for real? Or is she just playing the role of the loyal black friend in a reality TV presidency?\n\nBlack conservatives like Patton, long confusing to liberals, are positively confounding in the age of Trump. Why do they stick by a president who makes openly racist statements and inspires white supremacists ? But Patton insisted that she's worked for Donald Trump and his family for a decade and truly believes that if they were racist, \"one of the children would have slipped up by now.\" She continued, dropping one of her many well-rehearsed lines, \"I've said before and I'll say it again: Trump sees things as success or failure, not color, race, gender, or creed.\"\n\nPatton's path to Trump family insider started in New Haven, Connecticut, a place she's said \" used to be a shithole. \" Her parents are Democrats; her father, an epidemiology professor at Yale, knew Ben Carson before the brain surgeon became HUD secretary. Patton graduated from Tabor Academy, a tony boarding school, in 1991; got an English degree from the University of Miami in 1996; and enrolled at Quinnipiac University School of Law but never finished. (Her official resume listed both Quinnipiac and Yale, suggesting she'd graduated from both. She later clarified that she attended summer courses at Yale.) She worked as a paralegal before joining the Eric Trump Foundation as vice president following an introduction by Michael Cohen, the president's then-fixer, eventually becoming a Trump family senior aide in 2012. In 2015, she was named Trump's liaison for \"minority engagement.\"\n\nWhen I asked her when she became a Republican, Patton invoked 9/11. \"It was at that moment that I realized that patri­otism was simply a punchline for Democrats. But for Republicans, it's our lifestyle,\" she told me. She voted for Obama in 2008, only to have second thoughts when he began to focus on health care reform. \"I regret that vote with every fiber of my being.\"\n\nPatton first came to the public's attention when she landed a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in July 2016. Taking the podium in a crisp white blazer, she talked about racism and black men who had been killed by police. \"As a minority myself, I personally pledge to you that Donald Trump knows that your life matters, he knows that my life matters,\" she said, her voice rising with conviction.\n\nAfter Trump won, Patton-despite having little housing and policy experience-was appointed as HUD's administrator for the New York and New Jersey region, home to the nation's largest public housing agency. A front-page story in the New York Daily News misidentified her as Eric Trump's wedding planner . When I asked her about the stubborn persistence of this dig at her qualifications, Patton shrugged it off. \"The [Trump] family and I laugh about it,\" she insisted.\n\nNone of this live-and-let-live attitude is evident in Patton's outsize social media presence. Her Twitter accounts (one personal , one official ) and Instagram feed are full of Trumpy indignation, lib-owning, and praise for the president. Immediately after Jeffrey Epstein's suicide was reported, she trumpeted that he'd been \"Hillary'd .\" In September, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that she had violated the Hatch Act , which bans federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain partisan activities. The office reprimanded her for misusing her official Twitter account and warned her against future violations of the law.\n\nPatton has also used her feed to recount horror stories about living in public housing run by the New York City Housing Authority and yell at its officials for their alleged failings. \"The regional director is a kind of ally in seeing that the housing resources in the region are properly fed by HUD in Washington,\" explains Victor Bach, the senior housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York. \"This is the first HUD regional director in my experience...who has been critical of NYCHA and challenging its competence.\"\n\nMuch of Patton's job involves overseeing a public housing system with enormous, long-standing problems, including NYCHA. To highlight those issues, Patton announced last November that she would spend a month living in city housing authority apartments. When she moved in early this year, some residents were skeptical-\"Who the hell is Lynne Patton?\" one asked a New York Daily News reporter -while others held out hope that this meant their living condi­tions would finally improve. In a clip Patton posted to Facebook Live, a woman in the Patterson Houses, in the Bronx, showed her a bathroom with a broken shower rod, peeling paint, and mold. Patton blamed the conditions on slow contractors seeking to \"generate overtime money.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the truth about the decay of New York's public housing is a lot more complicated. Established in 1934 , the city housing authority initially gave preference for subsidized apartments to middle-class white families. As it loosened its restrictions, its population grew poorer and browner. Today, 46 percent of NYCHA families have a working person in the household; more than 40 percent are supported by government benefits like Social Security and pensions. More than half of the agency's 564,000 residents are under 21 or over 62, and the overwhelming majority are black or Latino.\n\nSince 2000, the federal government has made drastic cuts to public housing. NYCHA currently needs $32 billion to restore its nearly 2,500 properties, some of which are more than 50 years old. While mismanagement has played a role in the agency's woes, \"the problem is not with NYCHA's vulner­abilities, but with the lack of federal funding,\" says Bach. \"The situation has gotten worse since the Trump administration.\" He notes that the president has repeatedly proposed terminating capital subsidies used for major repairs. During her public housing residency, Patton insisted that the HUD budget, which Trump had proposed to slash by 16 percent, wasn't final. This was true-not because Trump had relented but because House Democrats would not approve his cuts.\n\nIn the middle of her NYCHA stay, Patton was summoned to Capitol Hill. Cohen, the president's former lawyer and Patton's ex-friend, was set to appear before the House Oversight committee and testify that Trump was a liar, a con man, and a racist. To dispute those claims, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) invited Patton as a character witness. She stood silently behind Meadows as he told the nation that Patton, the daughter of a man from the Deep South, said \"there is no way she would work for an individual who was racist.\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) angrily responded that \"just because someone has a person of color, a black person, working for them, does not mean they aren't racist,\" and suggested that Patton was being used as \"a prop.\"\n\nAfterward, Patton went on Instagram to accuse Tlaib of playing the \"race card.\" On Fox & Friends , Patton asserted that believing Cohen, a white man, over her, a black woman, was the real racism . When I texted Patton about the hearing, she replied: \"I was never there to represent my entire race. I was there to represent one man-the President of the United States.\"\n\nJust after the hearing, the Washington Post reported that, in October 2018, Patton had asked HUD officials for legal and ethical guidance on her apparent desire to participate in a documentary series, produced by the makers of The Real Housewives of Potomac and centered on black Republicans. Unnamed HUD officials told the Post that Patton's proposal was rejected; she said she made her own decision not to participate. She informed me that the production company had started courting her in 2016: \"Therefore, the WP 's insinuation that I am attempting to parlay my attendance at the Cohen hearing or stay in public housing into an 'audition' was plain silly, as they had already offered me this opportunity long ago.\"\n\nOnce more, her banter seemed almost scripted. If I had any doubt of that, it evaporated when she texted: \"Being a black Republican is no longer an anomaly. We grow in number by the day. Not only do we suffer the same societal hurdles that face any black man or black woman, but we also have the additional albatross of being conservative.\" She'd given a nearly identical line to the Post six months earlier.\n\nTrue, being a black conservative is probably harder than being a black liberal. Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former Apprentice contestant who spent a year as a White House official, said she was abandoned by her friends and received death threats for supporting Trump. Yet while Patton admits that black people confront societal hurdles, white conservative ideology does not accept the idea that black people face any special challenges-at least not any that white people don't also face. When I asked Patton how she reconciles herself to that misalignment, she texted back: \"I think the majority of black conservatives simply reject the idea that 'victimhood' is an acceptable lifestyle.\" She continued: \"Not all people of color view themselves as inferior and, therefore, are not offended by the truth-such as the President's factual comments on long-standing Baltimore distress,\" referring to Trump's tweets calling Rep. Elijah Cummings' Baltimore district \"a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\" that \"no human being\" would want to live in. The rant wasn't a dog whistle; it was a bullhorn. But Patton couldn't hear it.\n\n\"Black conservatives also refuse to subscribe to the 'group-think' ideology,\" she continued. \"We choose to vote based upon policy, not skin color. If that's offensive to anyone, then that's their problem, not ours.\" She signed off with the shrugging emoji.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "In the Nation's Capital, Fewer Than Half of Black Males Graduate From High School\n\nThe term \"black lives matter\" has become the battle cry for Americans outraged by the recent deaths of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and other unarmed black men at the hands of police. Indeed, the folks at the Schott Foundation for Public Education aim to help make those lives matter before they come to a premature end. Black Lives Matter, its fifth annual report on the state of black youth in the public schools, looks at suspension and graduation rates and points to some alarming trends.\n\nFor example, according to the report, 15 percent of black males nationwide have been suspended from school, versus only 5 percent of white boys. Missouri, Michigan, and Florida have some of the highest suspension rates for black boys: greater than 20 percent. These findings parallel a March 2013 study by the Discipline Disparities Research-to-Practice Collaborative, which found that black students and students with disabilities are suspended at \"hugely disproportionate rates.\"\n\nAll of this information is presented in the context of the school-to-prison pipeline; data has shown suspensions increase the likelihood of students dropping out, and many end up in the criminal justice system. In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that about 75 percent of Florida ninth graders who were never suspended as freshman graduated from high school. Those suspended once had a 52 percent graduation rate. For those suspended multiple times, the rate was just 38 percent.\n\nNationally, the Schott report notes, only 59 percent of black males graduate from high school, versus 80 percent of white males. The worst rates were found in Washington, DC, and in Nevada-both had graduation rates of less than 50 percent for black males.\n\nThat's a bleak picture. But the report also aims to highlight the achievements of young black men who graduate from high school, such as the more than two million with four-year college degrees and those who have left significant marks in the world of business, finance, science, and the arts.\n\nThe high suspension and low graduation rates received national attention last January: President Barack Obama rolled out his first \"school discipline guidelines,\" which hold schools legally responsible for the disparate impact of their disciplinary actions on different races. In February 2014 the president announced his \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative. With more than $200 million in foundation support, it aims to help black youths finish school and stay out of the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Schott report comes one week after the publication of Black Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced and Underprotected , a new report from Columbia Law School that highlights an even greater disparity in the rates of punishment for black girls: Crunching data from the Department of Education, the authors found that black girls are suspended six time s more often than white girls, whereas black boys were suspended three times as often as white boys.\n\n\"We must challenge the assumption,\" says Columbia Law School professor Kimberlé Crenshaw , the report's lead author, \"that the lives of girls and women-who are often left out of the national conversation-are not also at risk.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Rich History and Underestimated Political Clout of the Black Working Class\n\nMother Jones; Katrina Wittkamp\n\nThe 2024 presidential election cycle has begun, and the white working class once more has commanded the spotlight. Pollsters obsess over how their economic struggles and resentments influence their political choices. Democrats and Republicans jockey to win their favor, each promising- through different cultural and political appeals-to address their individual and collective needs while igniting a new era of economic prosperity.\n\nBut where in this landscape are the direct appeals to the Black working class? This is a group that has experienced political and economic turmoil like few others, while simultaneously expanding the possibilities of the American political system. As Blair Kelley, an acclaimed, award-winning historian of Black history at UNC-Chapel Hill, writes in her new book, Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class, \"When Black workers are mentioned, the idea of work is often dropped, instead it becomes a discussion about the poor .\" But, in fact, Black workers are the backbone of the labor force. Or as Kelley puts it, \"More than 28 percent of 42 million Black people in America today-the majority of the Black working class-are essential workers.\"\n\nIn Kelley's hands, modern labor struggles-from UPS workers fighting for a fair contract to Amazon workers demanding better working conditions - become historical epics made possible by the contributions of Black workers centuries ago. We can see the roots of solidarity between poor white workers and rich white capitalists, and how Black workers became a critical force for civil rights. We meet Black laundresses who brought cities to a grinding halt during Reconstruction by organizing powerful unions within a year of leaving slavery.\n\nIn their struggles and the fabric of their lives, Kelley discovers patterns that help to explain the current political landscape. The trajectory of this history led to the 2020 election when the support of Black working-class voters catapulted candidate Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination and then the presidency. You can see how that electoral bloc made the impossible possible by flipping Georgia despite a global pandemic and widespread voter suppression. As we approach the 2024 presidential race, Black Folk feels especially timely in its compelling argument about the important role Black workers play in shoring up American democracy. I caught up with Blair Kelly over Zoom from her office in Chapel Hill.\n\nThere's been seemingly endless political and media attention on the white working class, but so little focus on the Black working class. Who is the Black working class? What made you decide to write a book about them?\n\nAt first, I thought this wasn't the book for me. I'm not a labor historian or someone who has been studying unions exclusively for a long time. When my editor asked what a book from my perspective as a scholar of Black history would look like, I realized my family was at the heart of how I could approach the question. My family members weren't necessarily famous labor organizers or people who led wildcat strikes. They worked jobs. They had relationships within the communities that supported them. I wanted to start with them and the humanity behind those who work.\n\nI define the term \"Black working class\" broadly. It's probably broader than most scholars might frame it because the book begins with enslavement, and a good Marxist would never start with enslavement. You would begin when people are free. But for me, the roots of Black working people start in our history of being in bondage in this country, our relationships to those institutions, and the ways in which we built community, resistance, and life in spite of enslavement.\n\nYou describe Black churches during enslavement as a \"launching pad for working-class organization.\" Do you see that spirit in modern Black churches today, or has that legacy shifted?\n\nOur churches are so different from where our forebearers' were. For one thing, there were no megachurches coming out of enslavement. In the traditional church spaces that still exist, I do see some things that strengthen the working-class community. Encouraging young people to build their voices, for example. Churches are often the first place where young people speak, sing, or play an instrument. There's encouragement for people to serve and lead. And to complicate ideas of who should be in leadership, it doesn't matter if you're a PhD or a postal worker. In traditional church spaces, those outside assumptions can melt away.\n\nBut the number of churches like that is decreasing over time because of the pull towards prosperity gospel - that preaches if God is blessing you, you're wealthy, financially free , and successful. And that's not where we come from as a people. The roots of Black Christianity are about believing that you are God's chosen, in spite of the fact that you don't have the worldly things people use to measure success. It was about the justice that you knew would come, if not in this life then the next.\n\nTo me, the prosperity gospel is anathema to thinking about holding up and supporting a Black working class. We face structural challenges that provide us with a world where most Black people are not going to be wealthy, and that shouldn't make people think, well God doesn't love me.\n\nDo you believe Black churches are still radical spaces?\n\nThey can be. I belong to a traditional Black church. I'm in leadership and my husband is too. And I believe in Black institutions. I mean look at where I am. I'm a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. This is an embattled space; it's one of the roots of the affirmative action case. I'm here because it's a state institution that admits Black students, working-class people, and students from rural communities who want the best education they can get in their home state. And I believe in that project.\n\nI've been in all kinds of institutions that are problematic-Duke, UVA, NC State-and yet, I believed in the possibility of those institutions. So why in the hell would I not believe in the possibility of Black institutions? Why would I say Black institutions have flawed histories and should be disposed of? And then be in white institutions, that have flawed histories about my own people, and then say we can work it out! I believe we should inhabit Black spaces even when they are deeply imperfect.\n\nCan the roots of the white working class be found in slavery as well?\n\nAbsolutely. The greatest trick ever played on the white working class was to get them to invest in a system that kept them poorer than they should have been. Slavery is a disinvestment in free-working people. If you're just a regular white person with no land or enslaved people, this wasn't a system you were able to double dutch your way into. Your wages would be suppressed by the existence of enslaved people. So, wealthy white people got poor white people to buy into some notion of race that would make them feel equal in status and as if everything was fine. I think that trick is still being played.\n\nWhite working-class people need many of the same things as Black, Brown, and Asian working-class people do: health care, good schools, livable wages, higher education for their children. And yet people are still so invested in suppressing or being afraid of someone else that they aren't really considering their own positionality.\n\nBiden couldn't have won without the Black working class. How has writing this book shaped your understanding of that group's political priorities?\n\nRecognition is key. What happened in Georgia is a great example of that. Stacey Abrams and a whole panoply of Black organizations went to places that traditional candidates rarely go to and made it clear that they wanted to hear from those communities. That was so powerful it changed the electoral map and what was possible in a state like Georgia.\n\nThe recognition of their existence and prioritizing the questions that they want to ask is important. If you go to different parts of the country, you're going to get different answers. In some places , it's environmental justice. Rural, working-class Black people live in some of the most toxic places in the world. If you're in urban spaces, the decay and abandonment of cities are likely important. People want investment in their communities, safe places for their kids. They want education and a decent wage. They're ready for the possibility of change, but it starts with the recognition of the particularities of their vulnerabilities.\n\nThis seems like a very pragmatic group of voters. Where do you think that pragmatism comes from?\n\nThere's less focus on the particularities of the person representing you compared to what they actually get done. You can see that from a whole series of Black mayors who didn't have the chops to get things done and were more invested in their own stuff. If there's someone who knows how to get things done and can listen and understand how things work in their local communities, that's what Black working-class voters care the most about. That's what Biden represents. He was the most pragmatic-looking person in the previous election.\n\nYour book reveals labor struggles that have rarely seen the light of day. I was so captivated by the post-Civil War strike waves set off by Black laundresses. Can you talk about Black domestic workers as a political force?\n\nTara Hunter's book To 'Joy My Freedom is an incredible account of the Atlanta Washerwomen's Strike of 1881 when 3,000 of the city's laundresses organized a union to demand better pay and labor conditions during the Atlanta Exposition. But that strike happened on a smaller scale everywhere.\n\nBlack washerwomen set the terms of their employment from the very first moment of emancipation. They refused to wash clothes on holidays. People wanted them to wash multiple loads in a week, to set the timelines for their work, and they said no. In 1865, Black washerwomen organized a union in Jackson, Mississippi. Who comes out of enslavement and organizes a union immediately? That tells you everything you need to know about who enslaved people were. It's a reminder that workers don't need someone to raise their consciousness. They don't need someone to come teach them about what's oppressive about what they do or the power they wield when they come together. They might need the resources of a union, but they damn sure don't need directions.\n\nWhat are some other major pivotal moments within Black working-class history?\n\nI loved having the chance to write about the Pullman Porters and Black postal workers. They are that bridge between just working a job and making it a transformational collective enterprise. The Pullman Porters, like the washerwomen, could take advantage of the monopoly that they had on employment. George Mortimer Pullman wanted Black men to work on his sleeping cars. He pictured a sort of antebellum romantic version of travel would of course have a Black man servant waiting on you hand and foot. And those men became cosmopolitan leaders within the Black community, known for their mobility and knowledge. And when they formed a union, they used that platform to amplify demands from other workers.\n\nThe Pullman Porters powered the March on Washington movement, which started in the 1930s, and ultimately led to the 1963 March on Washington . Postal workers are the same. The first Black men who do postal service work are venerated Civil War veterans, and they had to fight hard against the myth of the Black male rapist just to deliver some mail and have a decent job. And many of them died. They were murdered by mobs in their effort to do postal work. That's something we don't think about. But their labor sets the groundwork for a civil rights generation that fights for access to federal jobs, which was a powerful counter to state-by-state segregation.\n\nDo you think the demise of race-conscious admissions will affect the Black working class?\n\nI have thought that affirmative action was going away my whole adult life-the argument against it has been so profound and hostile, and the ground on which most people discuss it is so a-historical. People talk about affirmative action like it's just about diversity and wanting to see different-looking people in a room when it's about historic exclusion. We're in the middle of a complicated reparations discussion around the country. Affirmative action could have been thought of in those terms-but it's gone.\n\nThe pathways that make it difficult to attend elite institutions are fraught and difficult for working-class communities because of the structural forces that make education unequal in this country. The things that tie the quality of education to housing and zip code. Those are fundamental injustices that, as a country, we are not interested in addressing. So, the narrow pipeline that pulls people out of under-resourced communities and into elite institutions just got narrower.\n\nBut as I said earlier, I believe in Black institutions. I am thankful that HBCUs still exist. I am hopeful that Black communities will begin to further invest in the experiences of HBCU students. I don't think that there's a legal means by which we can really contest this change, but I think enriching what the broader set of possibilities are for Black students should be the work.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Are Successful Black Men Assumed to Be Athletes or Entertainers?\n\nOprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan in May 2011 Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nDuring a trip to Las Vegas, I arranged to interview a wealthy source in his fancy hotel suite. At the resort in question (and probably at all of them), there was a separate entrance to the area where the suites are located, with its own elevators that are off-limits to other guests. We shared the elevator with a fit, well-dressed young Black man, who smiled politely and said hello. Later, my source, who is white, told me the guy was for sure a pro athlete. \"I could tell,\" he said confidently.\n\nCould he, really? Based on the man's build, maybe it wasn't an outlandish assumption, but would he have assumed the same of a fit young white guy?\n\nThis actually happens a lot. I write about it in my book, Jackpot . The lead character in the chapter titled \"Thriving While Black\" is a successful Black business executive named Erwin Raphael. He's 56 now, like me, and still quite fit-unlike me. Back in the day, he was actually pretty good at basketball, he says, but he was equally good at chemistry, his college major, in which his professors didn't necessarily expect him to excel, he realized.\n\nNowadays, particularly in upscale settings, white people tend to assume he's a former professional athlete. Why else would a Black man be playing golf, for example, at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where it is said that one must plop down several hundred thousand dollars up front (the club won't disclose its fees) to be a member-if invited-and hefty monthly fees on top of that?\n\nAt that very club the day before we sat down to talk, a white member had spotted Raphael as he was getting ready to play a round. The man came over, all friendly, and asked Raphael whether he used to be an athlete. \"Now, there's a better than even chance that my physical appearance would justify this question,\" he admits. But \"the stereotype is that wealthy Black people are not creators of wealth.\"\n\nTo resist that cultural bias, he says, he usually responds to such an approach with something like, \"'Nope, not at all. I was quite the nerd'-and I am a certified, card-carrying nerd!\" On this particular occasion, he answered the man straightforwardly and was annoyed with himself afterward. \"I thought, Wow, you idiot ! He clearly assumed that the only reason you would get to be a member here is had you been an athlete.\"\n\nThat the athlete/entertainer wealth trope contains a hint of truth-the majority of Black American billionaires fall into those categories, for example-may be evidence of the constrained path to success that our society offers certain categories of people, even today. Black entrepreneurs and executives are overlooked by the majority culture, Raphael told me. He likes to ask his white business colleagues a question: \"I know it makes them uncomfortable but I want to prove a point. I say, 'In the last 12 months, how many of the people that you've invited to your home were Black?' The answer is almost always zero.\"\n\nHis point: Their Black work \"friends\" are in fact colleagues, not true friends, even though everyone might socialize over drinks after work on occasion. \"You don't see them as Black people,\" Raphael says. \"Where most white people see Black people are on TV or in the movies. And the ones who are successful, very rarely is it the professional, the businessman, the entrepreneur.\"\n\nAlthough Raphael's family was poor when he and his six siblings were growing up on the Caribbean island of Dominica, and later St. Croix, several siblings ended up being very successful. His brother Sam now owns a resort in Dominica, where guests regularly ask him how he made his money. \"The assumption is he must be a drug dealer or something,\" Raphael says. (Another Hollywood trope.) \"His going line is 'I grew up a coconut picker.' People don't walk into hotels and ask a white owner, 'How did you get your money?'\"\n\nI have an amateur musician friend , Mark Montgomery French, who is without question a card-carrying nerd. He also happens to be Black, six-foot-nine, and has zero interest in sports. Every week for the past three decades, since he reached adult height, Mark tells me in an email, \"a total stranger would ask me the same four-word question. It's practically a script.\"\n\nHe proceeds to write out the script:\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nMARK is standing on a street corner, minding his own business. Suddenly we see GENERIC EVERYPERSON approach him from the front, looking up at MARK's height in amazement, mouth opening in slo-mo as a question stumbles out of it.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (beatifically): Do you play basketball?\n\nMARK (neutral, but like so over this): No I do not.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (confused, with a hint of hostility): What? Why? If I were your height I'd play all the time! Yadda-yadda-yadda Michael Jordan yadda-yadda-yadda high school coach yadda-yadda-yadda basketball-specific reference that I assume you understand...\n\nMARK (totally checked out): Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's nice. Uh-huh.\n\nGENERIC EVERYPERSON (still rolling): Yadda-yadda-yadda Are your kids tall?\n\nFADE OUT\n\nMark has made a good living for himself as the creative director for various marketing and tech firms, where he is invariably the company's first Black creative director. At one job, he befriended a white colleague an inch taller than he is. \"None of the above has ever happened to him,\" Mark told me.\n\nBut \"the upside to people thinking I must be a rich ex-baller is that I receive MUCH less racial abuse than other Black people,\" he continued. \"I've gotten free food at restaurants, high fives from numerous drunken men at airport sports bars, and exceptional service at hotels, all because I look like I might have a high-priced attorney on retainer. Fame-even perceived fame due to skin color and height-is more potent than racism.\"\n\nGrowing up in St. Croix, Raphael told me, he was surrounded by successful Black role models, and that made him feel he could follow his dreams wherever they took him. Indeed, if you bother to look, these role models can be found in America, too. Yet despite the presence of Black entrepreneurs and businesspeople; brilliant authors, scholars, scientists, and inventors; doctors, diplomats, lawyers and judges; successful Black people remain \"under-indexed\" in America, notes Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation.\n\nWalker, who is Black, grew up in rural Texas, where his family lived on the knife-edge of poverty, and bill collectors would come around to hound his hard-working single mother. Walker managed to escape the same plight, achieve tremendous success, and help take care of relatives who couldn't. White people cite his success, he told me, to show that anyone in America can overcome adversity and rise up. But that's apocryphal. Walker knows from experience that stories like his are, in fact, exceedingly rare-and that the way America's majority culture perceives Black people remains a barrier, psychological and practical, to upward mobility. Our misguided racial narratives, he says, contribute \"to the lack of achievement and the collective sense of limitations.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

They see us out here in the community,\" the group's leader, Zeek Williams, said between honks from passing cars and renditions of Detroit's ubiquitous colloquial greeting, \"Whatup Doe!\"\n\n\"We gotta be out here,\" Williams said. \"We gotta be the ones to be out here to step with our people, make sure that we are, you know, putting on for the culture, as we like to say.\"\n\nWilliams is the founder of New Era Detroit, a community-based organization that connects residents in some of the city's most disinvested neighborhoods with badly needed resources. The needs include public safety, housing support and youth and political education programs, and the group does everything from armed patrols of crime hot spots to hosting massive community cleanup efforts and block parties that double as resource fairs. It's always looking to secure grants and public funds to redistribute to neighborhoods in the most need.\n\nWilliams describes New Era Detroit's role as filling the often-massive gap between the people and the politicians in his city. It's not an explicitly political group. But it is a window into a key group of voters whom both parties are eyeing - and perhaps misunderstanding - ahead of the 2024 election: Black men.\n\nPublic opinion polls find that larger numbers of Black men are up for grabs now than in past elections. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are both making appeals to them. But there's also a persistent sense among Williams and others in his orbit, in a battleground-state big city, that no one in the political world is really trying to build true relationships with Black people, especially Black men like those in New Era. Some are questioning not just whom to support for president but whether to vote at all.\n\n\"We are one of the leading organizers on the ground in the city of Detroit. Literally the closest that you're gonna get to Black people in this city,\" Williams said. \"But we haven't heard anything from a Democrat or Republican.\"\n\nMen like them, in communities like theirs, in battleground states like Michigan, might feel overlooked, but they could very well hold the power to determine who wins the White House in November. And both Democrats and Republicans know as much, vying in their own ways for Black male attention and votes.\n\nTrump, in controversial fashion, has used his criminal court cases and the release of a gaudy signature gold sneaker to appeal to younger Black men.\n\n\"I got indicted a second time and a third time and a fourth time, and a lot of people said that that's why the Black people like me,\" Trump said this year at a gala sponsored by Black conservatives in South Carolina, \"because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the Biden administration has ramped up engagement with Black voters. Late last month, Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her \"Economic Opportunity Tour,\" a multicity effort to reconnect with Biden's base of Black support and highlight what he has delivered.\n\n\"The data is clear,\" Harris told NBC News at her stop in Atlanta. \"Black men have not benefited proportionately to other populations in terms of economic opportunity and economic health, much less wealth creation.\"\n\nHarris continued the thread a week later in a visit to Detroit, where she told an audience, \"Since 2019, Black wealth is up 60%, so President Biden and I are clear: These are not only our accomplishments; they are yours. ... It is the result of your drive, your creativity and your power.\"\n\nAnd Biden sat down this week with a popular Black radio host, WVEE-FM's Darian \"Big Tigger\" Morgan, in Atlanta, where he talked about the Biden-Harris administration's accomplishments for Black Americans and the stakes of the election.\n\n\"Look, Trump hurt Black people every chance he got as president,\" Biden said, pointing to unemployment rates, Trump's tax cuts and Trump's Covid-19 response and its effect on Black Americans.\n\n\"Your vote is your voice,\" Biden continued. \"Lots of close elections, these last couple, and every vote counts.\"\n\nAhead of the election, Black voters' traditional alignment with Democrats and Biden is showing signs of slipping.\n\nRecent polling has found Trump in the high teens or the low 20s among Black voters - still well behind Biden, but also well ahead of where he polled in 2020.\n\nAnd there are significant breaks along generational and gender lines. Younger Black voters are more open to the idea of supporting Trump. And while Black women remain a more loyal Democratic voting bloc, Black men have shown more political malleability.\n\nThat could have big effects in a state like Michigan, where Trump won in 2016 in part because of a dip in Black voter turnout from 2012. While Hillary Clinton beat Trump in Detroit in 2016, she did so with 46,872 fewer votes than President Barack Obama got just four years earlier. And amid wide dissatisfaction with both major-party candidates this year, there's concern among some that turnout may very well look similar to that of 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, in recent months, Biden, Harris, Trump and third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have all made trips to Michigan without visiting the mostly poor and mostly Black neighborhoods where New Era has made its mark.\n\nWhile Biden has locked in on traditional Black voters and continues to meet them where they are, he could be overlooking a huge swath of atypical but reachable Black voters. He will be back in Detroit over the weekend, keynoting the Detroit NAACP chapter's marquee fundraising event with thousands of Black Detroit's movers and shakers, 10 miles and a world away from New Era's Detroit.\n\nThe glaring absence of a true ground presence in New Era's neighborhoods could spell trouble for the candidates in what is likely to be a close race.\n\n\"You wouldn't even be able to tell this is an election year in our communities, unless somebody flies in for a day and gives a speech. Other than that, you know, it's business as usual,\" Williams said. \"You got to think, man, we live in communities where people are worried about their next meal, where people are worrying about if they're going to be able to keep the lights on. So you have to excuse our people sometimes when we're not all into two political candidates who ultimately don't relate or connect to us.\"\n\nOn this day, Williams and his team were canvassing an area in West Detroit that's in more need than most. At a gas station where women have been robbed, they pumped gas for customers and pointed to the New Era \"Safe Zone\" sticker on the station's glass door, with instructions to scan a QR code if they're ever in danger. They rolled through a nearby liquor store, about six men deep, to check on the store's clerks.\n\n\"Their presence kind of lets people know that we're all in it together. You know, that we're not over here by ourselves,\" said Sherri Smith, one of the vendors at a food hall named Whatcha Wanna Eat. \"What they do for the community is worth its weight in gold.\"\n\nBack at New Era's headquarters, a gutted, renovated, converted former weed shop, the walls are lined with photos from the group's work in the community and a large map of the U.S., with markers pointing to a growing list of New Era chapter cities, among them Baltimore; Cleveland; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; and Miami.\n\n\"In this place, we provide all different types of tangible resources,\" Williams said, citing struggling with utility bills to dealing with harassment in the community.\n\nThat kind of connection in the community has situated the group in an enviable political space. It has worked with local candidates to help get them in front of prospective voters, and it hosts voter education classes so people have a better sense of policy issues and how they affect them and their communities.\n\n\"When people come to our communities and pander for votes, and we know we have never seen this person before ever, and they finally come to our communities and say, 'Hey, you know, I'm trying to get your vote,' that's done. We know it's fake. We know it's not real. Therefore, it turns us off with the process,\" Williams said.\n\n\"The things that politicians are supposed to be able to do for us in our communities are real things,\" he continued. But connection between the political system and the community \"has not felt real to us.\"\n\nThat afternoon, a line of people stretched from New Era's front door out into its parking lot. The organization had put out a social media blast about securing funding to help folks in need. People who were facing eviction, behind on their utility bills or needing help with medical debts all came down to see what New Era could do.\n\n\"It means a lot to me. This is my son, and he's doing what he's always done: care for the people,\" said Ozzie Williams, Zeek's father, who also works with New Era.\n\nAsked whether any of the presidential candidates have piqued his interest or earned his vote, he said just one: Joe Biden.\n\n\"Me and my family, we're Democrats, OK? It is what it is. Donald Trump is Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nZeek Williams said that neither Trump nor Biden has earned his vote yet and that he's not even sure whether he'll vote in the election. \"How can you ask us as a whole, like, how can these people earn your vote? We've never seen these people. You know what I mean? They're not real people. When they come to Michigan and they come to these places - but it's not in our places.\"\n\nDeAndre Richardson, a family friend who's also New Era's head school liaison and is part of New Era's patrol unit, chimed in, saying that he's undecided between Biden and Trump but that he's also seeing a shift in the way many younger Black men are engaging with the political parties.\n\n\"Yeah, they question a lot more. Especially on the blue side. It's a lot of people shifting from blue to red, blue to red, because people are seeing the type of person you are instead of your politics,\" Richardson said.\n\nAll three of the men agreed on one other thing: Any candidate who wants to earn and expand the Black male vote is going to have to show up and be consistent.\n\n\"We just want to see you and touch you and feel your vibe,\" Richardson said. \"We are energy people; we feel energy. So bring your energy back to the block. And then we'll make our observations.\"\n\nTrymaine Lee is an NBC News correspondent.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

This report is easily the most thorough examination I've seen into how false and manipulative claims make their way from bad actors to Black folks.\n\nI clicked on it so fast that I almost hammered a hole in my desk. The report's analysis from the organization Onyx Impact can be found here .\n\nNBC News summarized it well :\n\nAt least 40 million Americans may be regularly targeted and fed disinformation within Black online spaces by a host of sources across social media, fueling false information around the election, according to a new report published Tuesday. Touted as the first deep dive into understanding disinformation targeting Black America, the report, published by Onyx Impact, a nonprofit organization working to combat disinformation within the Black community, identified half a dozen core online networks \"reaching or targeting\" Black Americans online with false and misleading narratives.\n\nThe report highlights how extremists and other misinformation peddlers use outlets and influencers popular among Black folks to spread far-right claims and indoctrinate audiences with a conservative worldview. It lists several \"gateway influencers and platforms\" - media entities that are popular among Black folks and have been targeted by extremists - that have promoted misleading or bigoted views. That list mentions the online tabloid The Shade Room, the syndicated radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" influencer 19 Keys, the Joe Budden Podcast, The Stephen A. Smith Show, and the podcast \"Earn Your Leisure.\"\n\nNone of the aforementioned platforms responded to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nThe report notes that some of these outlets' large audiences could make them very useful in dispelling false and misleading claims, but it also highlights how some of these entities have already platformed extremist right-wingers . It also talks about some other concepts we've discussed here on the blog, including efforts to promote anti-immigrant sentiment within the Black community ( a Trumpian strategy we're seeing unfold today) and efforts to promote toxic hypermasculinity among Black men . And it talks about how artificial intelligence tools will likely exacerbate the spread of targeted disinformation without measures to combat it.\n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom. The report includes suggestions on how to combat the spread of disinformation through Black influencers and outlets.\n\nIn our increasingly fragmented media landscape, this is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand how to fight back against far-right manipulation.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

The administration has so far offered few details on the nuts and bolts of the initiative or how it would be funded or coordinated nationally.\n\nA White House official told msnbc that more details would be announced when the program is officially launched February 27. Resources dedicated to the new initiative are \"significant and growing,\" the official said, without offering a dollar figure.\n\nSuch vagueness concerns many advocates, who say addressing the myriad challenges facing minority men requires a firm commitment and resources to match.\n\n\"What worries me is that it will be symbolic and not substantive and anything that does not address the real structural barriers to opportunity for young men of color is going to be meaningless,\" said Pedro Noguera, executive director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education at New York University. \"We've got to look at jobs, job training, education and something different from what they've been doing, because what they've been doing hasn't been working.\"\n\nMy Brother's Keeper is the latest in a string of recent administration efforts to ease the burdens of America's most vulnerable, among them young black and Latino men. And it comes at a critical moment in Obama's presidency, as a second-term offers the rare benefit of hindsight and course correction.\n\nAs much as President Obama's legacy will be defined by his ascendance as a black man to the presidency of the United States, he spent much of his first term in office skirting the very notion of race. But since his historic election, Obama's presidency has been marred by partisan fights and dreams of change torn apart by political gridlock and obstructionism. In his second term Obama seems to have shifted to secure the very legacy, as America's first black president, that he largely avoided in his first four years in office.\n\nWill it be enough and is there adequate time for Obama to offer his most ardent block of constituents anything in the way of meaningful policy that will solidify that legacy?\n\n\"It's not too little too late, but it's been too little,\" said Khary Lazarre-White, executive director and founder of The Brotherhood/Sister Sol , a youth advocacy group based in Harlem, NY. \"I understand the restrictions on the President and the do-nothing Congress that he has been faced with that has been intransient. That being said, I don't think there has been enough of an effort around policy, the use of the bully pulpit to address these issues.\"\n\nA change in tone\n\nWhen Obama was pressed by the Congressional Black Caucus in his first term to do more to address double-digit black unemployment rates, he would often speak of a broader mission to improve the national economy. \"I want all Americans to have opportunity. I'm not the president of black America. I'm the president of the United States of America,\" Obama told Black Enterprise magazine in 2012.\n\nCritics complained he'd forgotten his roots as a community organizer on the south side of Chicago, and that in the bubble of mostly white advisers he'd been insulated from the harsh realities facing many African Americans. The president was also skewered for how he sometimes addressed black audiences, rubbing folks the wrong way with his talk of bootstrap responsibility that was viewed more as chastisement than brotherly love.\n\nBut last summer, amid national protests and anger following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, Obama stepped before cameras and spoke in a way that signaled a tonal and practical shift in the way he and his administration would handle matters of race in his second term. He spoke eloquently of the travails of being young and black in America, asking if more could be done to give black boys a sense that \"their country cares about them and values them.\"\n\nIt's a cause that has been both fashionable and fleeting, time and again.\n\nFor the better part of two decades non-profit groups, governmental agencies, philanthropists and universities have tried to address the challenges of young black and Latino men with varying results. And there has been no real meaningful, robust policy initiative on the state or national level that has put forth the kind of resources required to attack the vast array of social, educational and economic hurdles that confront this demographic.\n\nEven as the plight of young men of color has cycled in and out of various philanthropic circles as a favored cause, prospects for these young men have remained relatively bleak despite the steep costs shouldered by society when they fall through the cracks.\n\n\"Given that there has been so much activity, why has the outcome not changed? Why have the numbers of black men in college, in terms of enrollment and academic performance and graduation rates pretty much remained the same as they were 15 years prior?\" said Shaun Harper , a professor in the graduate school of education at the University of Pennsylvania who has researched the effectiveness of educational programs focused on young men of color.\n\nThe alarming statistics regarding minority male achievement have sparked a kind of knee-jerk reaction, compelling leaders to \"act quickly without serious strategic planning,\" Harper said.\n\nPHOTO ESSAY: The toll of zero-tolerance discipline\n\nEfforts have been narrowly limited and often launched in stand-alone or fragmented ways, Harper said. There has generally been a lack of comprehensive efforts that offered a wrap-around approach that sought to remedy the many very real barriers between these young men and solid, stable lives.\n\n\"Educators and policy makers have been attempting to solve the education problem without connecting it appropriately to other aspects of young men's lives,\" Harper said. \"A kid can't do well in school if he's hungry or if he lives in severe poverty or if he doesn't have healthcare or his neighborhood is especially violent.  All of those things undermine school achievement and school, college and career readiness.\"\n\n'Make sure people are talking about this'\n\nEven with the lack of detail offered by the administration, the My Brother's Keeper initiative suggests Obama in his second term is more willing to use policy to address the condition of minority Americans.\n\n\"What he's tried to do consistently is make sure people are talking about this,\" said David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative for Educational Excellence for African Americans . Obama launched that initiative in 2012 with an executive order to help accelerate national efforts to support African American students.\n\n\"We can't take for granted that people are talking about the importance of education and the importance of supporting boys and men of color across the board, not just academically but socially and emotionally,\" Johns said.\n\nLast year the Justice Department overhauled crack-era drug sentencing laws that largely punished non-violent, minority offenders with stiff mandatory sentences. The department also recently refined guidelines to school districts on 'zero tolerance' discipline policies that have disproportionally affected black and Latino students.  Just last month the president and First Lady Michelle Obama announced an initiative that would knock down some of the barriers between poor and minority students and a college education.The Obama administration has taken other steps to address challenges disproportionally facing young people of color.\n\n\"This initiative and where the president's heart is on this is something that is going to last for generations,\" a White House official said. \"It takes it a step further than his representation as the first African-American president. It's him using his power to convene to bring people together and bring resources to really target these young men.\"\n\nBut advocates for young minority men say the time has come for a greater commitment - one that carries real money and will be sustainable over time.\n\n\"What worries me is that it will be symbolic and not substantive and anything that does not address the real structural barriers to opportunity for young men of color is going to be meaningless.\"'\n\nMy Brother's Keeper was developed after months of meetings with community leaders, administration officials and groups of young minority men. On a number of occasions Obama sat with African American teenagers , many of whom are from the hard-scrabble streets of Chicago, the president's hometown.\n\nThe effort has drawn various cabinet level officials to the table including Attorney General Eric Holder and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, as well as business leaders including NBA Hall-of-Famer turned business mogul Earvin \"Magic Johnson.\n\nAdministration officials say the hope is to put teeth to programs already working across the country and further gains already being made, specifically on the academic front, including recent upticks in graduation rates among black and Latino high school students and rises in proficiency rates in math and reading for black fourth and eighth graders.\n\nThe recent spikes in black and Hispanic high school graduation rates have pushed the national graduation rate to its highest level since 1974 , according to the Department of Education. Officials there point to a report showing that from 2003-2010 the graduation rate for blacks jumped from 59% to 66% and the graduation rate for Hispanics rose from 66% to 71%. And while the rate of college enrollment for both groups has climbed over the past decade, it continues to remain low, with 32% of Hispanics enrolled in college and 38% of black students.\n\n\"I acknowledge that we can always do better. Our goal is that all of our kids have access to a high quality education,\" Johns said. \"There is still work to do and we'll spend the next 35 months accelerating as many opportunities as possible.\"\n\nBut academic gains aren't enough. The shooting deaths of Trayvon Martin , Jordan Davi s and other young black men killed by white men and police officers, and the daily drumbeat of urban gun violence of which minority men are the predominate perpetrators and victims, underscores the very perilous consequences they often face in a society that generally perceives them as a threat.\n\nWhen Obama stepped to the lectern last summer after Zimmerman's acquittal, he attempted to explain to the public why it had struck an especially tender cord in black America.\n\n\"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,\" Obama said , sharing his own experiences with racial stereotypes. It was an unusually candid moment for the president, who rarely draws attention to his race.\n\n\"Beyond protests or vigils, the question is, are there some concrete things that we might be able to do?\" he asked. \"Traditionally, these are issues of state and local government -- the criminal code. And law enforcement has traditionally done it at the state and local levels, not at the federal levels. That doesn't mean, though, that as a nation, we can't do some things that I think would be productive.\"\n\nMy Brother's Keeper seems to be rooted in that pivotal moment in Obama's presidency.\n\nStill, questions remain about how exactly it will differ from any that came before it.\n\n\"The problem is that too often the narrative of these efforts does not match the resources,\" said Lazarre-White, of The Brotherhood/Sister Sol.\n\n\"We need a Marshall plan for urban America,\" he said. \"We need a Marshall plan around these issues. It is positive that [President Obama] is brining attention to this issue in what he'll announce. But the major negative would be if the dollars don't match the narrative.\"\n\nThe New York City model\n\nPeople with knowledge of the development of My Brother's Keeper say the administration has looked toward an ambitious New York City initiative as a model.\n\nThat effort, a $130 million mix of city and private funding called the Young Men's Initiative , was launched in 2011 by then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. By most accounts it was the largest investment from any city in the nation that took aim at addressing the struggles of young men and boys of color.\n\nThe initiative was launched as a three year effort costing about $43 million a year addressing four key areas -- education, employment, health and justice. Its goal was to connect young men to educational, employment, and mentoring opportunities across more than a dozen city agencies and work to fill-out efforts already showing signs of success. It also developed or supported literacy and fatherhood programs.\n\nBut there's a catch: Half the funding for the initiative came from private monies provided by Bloomberg himself via Bloomberg Philanthropies and from fellow billionaire George Soros through the Campaign for Black Male Achievement at the Open Society Foundation .\n\nLinda Gibbs, who served as a deputy mayor under Bloomberg and supervised the implementation of the initiative across city agencies, said the quickest gains were made in education and justice. Through training and the development of alternatives to incarceration, the city was able to spur a drop in school suspension in pilot schools by about 23% and school arrests by about 34%, Gibbs said.\n\n\"A kid can't do well in school if he's hungry or if he lives in severe poverty or if he doesn't have healthcare or his neighborhood is especially violent.\"'\n\n\"A lot of systems still have a lot of old fashioned, tough on crime policies and they think nothing but arresting kids and teaching them a lesson is the only way to straighten them out. But the opposite is true,\" Gibbs said.\n\nAccording to the city's 2012 report on the Young Men's Initiative, all of New York City public schools are now measuring academic progress of black and Latino boys. And while the report highlights a number of modest gains in other areas, Gibbs said it's too early to really gauge the impact of the initiative.\n\nSupporters and critics alike questioned the sustainability of the New York City program given its three year timeframe and the uncertainty of future private funding. Some said the effort was doomed by a lack of financial resources and teeth.\n\nLazar Treschan, director of Youth Policy at the Community Service Society in New York who has studied the outcomes of New York's YMI said what is key is not just the scope of programming but the funding formula and implementation on the ground.\n\nTreschan said there's a half-life in terms of sustainably because once the private funding ends, a new administration is left holding the bag.\n\n\"While we've seen some strong results, I'm concerned about sustainability and that the programs need to be scaled,\" Treschan said.\n\nAnd while the announcement that the city was going to spend $130 million on the program garnered headlines, the annual allotment is a hard to track drop in the bucket in a city with a more than $70 billion budget.\n\nGibbs called the idea that the initiative hasn't been funded properly \"totally ridiculous.\"\n\n\"We already spend billions and billions and billions of dollars on services that produce bad incomes. People need to change the way they spend existing resources,\" Gibbs said.\n\nShe added, \"Anyone who thinks you're going to change a bad outcome by simply declaring it so is wrong. It takes long, hard, unrelenting work and anyone who doesn't believe that is fooling themselves.\"\n\nPedro Noguera, at the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, said he was skeptical of New York's Young Men's Initiative from the start because of what he described as politics muddying a really earnest effort to take on a serious societal issue.\n\n\"Because of political reasons they wouldn't even address the issue of stop-and-frisk , which in my opinion was part of the reason for the incarceration of an extraordinarily high number of young black men,\" Noguera said, referring to the New York Police Department's controversial policy which targeted mostly minority men for random stops. The tactic was championed by Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nUltimately, Noguera said, the success or failure of a federal initiative will hinge on funding, strategy and how the president is able to weather the political hits he may take over the effort.\n\n\"There's always politics and the President is going to hear people who are going to attack him for addressing black males. What's important to me is how he frames it, not as a black male problem but as an American problem,\" Noguera said.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

It takes long, hard, unrelenting work and anyone who doesn't believe that is fooling themselves.\"\n\nPedro Noguera, at the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, said he was skeptical of New York's Young Men's Initiative from the start because of what he described as politics muddying a really earnest effort to take on a serious societal issue.\n\n\"Because of political reasons they wouldn't even address the issue of stop-and-frisk , which in my opinion was part of the reason for the incarceration of an extraordinarily high number of young black men,\" Noguera said, referring to the New York Police Department's controversial policy which targeted mostly minority men for random stops. The tactic was championed by Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nUltimately, Noguera said, the success or failure of a federal initiative will hinge on funding, strategy and how the president is able to weather the political hits he may take over the effort.\n\n\"There's always politics and the President is going to hear people who are going to attack him for addressing black males. What's important to me is how he frames it, not as a black male problem but as an American problem,\" Noguera said.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Yet the partisan battle for Black support has intensified during the Trump era. Polls and surveys showed that Donald Trump made small inroads with Black male voters in 2016, and chipped away further at the Democrats' historic advantage with that demographic in 2020. And now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes. Harris herself has downplayed the notion that any Black vote is the rightful sole possession of Democrats, instead stressing that it must be \"earned\"-but that's not the dominant strain of rhetoric coming from other party leaders. More and more, anxious Democrats are prone to speak and act as if Black men who do not support the Democratic Party are guilty of an act of racial betrayal. Take, as just one prominent recent example, the scolding that Barack Obama delivered to his Back male audience as he stumped for Harris in East Liberty, Penn. Speaking to a group of committed Harris supporters who were volunteering for her campaign, Obama oddly went out of his way to castigate Black men for hesitating to support a female presidential candidate. \"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said. He went on to note that the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\" In an effort to reverse the decline of Black men's support for the Democratic Party, Harris recently released an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The plan would provide 1 million forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs to start a business. Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Again, look at the marijuana plank. Legalizing marijuana would undoubtedly help reduce arrests among Black offenders; however, the real problem here is the way Black Americans are policed at large-the legality of a given controlled substance plays a lamentably small role in the practice of police brutality or over-policing, as a former prosecutor like Harris well knows. Current Issue View our current issue Or take the education proposal. It's also a worthy goal to increase the number of Black men in education. Research shows that when Black students have a Black teacher, they earn higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from college. But here again, the deeper issue is structural: Black teachers have higher turnover rates than white teachers. (I know because I used to be one.) After Black teachers enter the profession, they often leave because of low pay, or because school administrators fail to support them, or value their contributions in the classroom. Harris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nAnd now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes.

Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Current Issue View our current issue Or take the education proposal. It's also a worthy goal to increase the number of Black men in education. Research shows that when Black students have a Black teacher, they earn higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from college. But here again, the deeper issue is structural: Black teachers have higher turnover rates than white teachers. (I know because I used to be one.) After Black teachers enter the profession, they often leave because of low pay, or because school administrators fail to support them, or value their contributions in the classroom. Harris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents.

Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nHarris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin.

There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nHere's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nMore than 200 black men have signed on to a letter expressing concerns about My Brother's Keeper, the initiative launched by President Obama and the philanthropic community earlier this year to address what the White House calls \" opportunity gaps \" facing young men and boys of color. The signers-among them actor and activist Danny Glover, scholar Robin D.G. Kelley and author Kiese Laymon-take issue with the $200 million effort's exclusive focus on boys and men. The entire letter is worth a read, but its argument is summed up in its final paragraph: If the denunciation of male privilege, sexism and rape culture is not at the center of our quest for racial justice, then we have endorsed a position of benign neglect towards the challenges that girls and women face that undermine their well-being and the well-being of the community as a whole. As Black men we believe if the nation chooses to \"save\" only Black males from a house on fire, we will have walked away from a set of problems that we will be compelled to return to when we finally realize the raging fire has consumed the Black women and girls we left behind. I raised similar concerns after the president's February announcement, so I'll be closely watching this effort to encourage the initiative to adopt a stance that's more inclusive to women and girls. This more holistic approach is crucial, according to the letter's signers, in part because \"our historic struggle for racial justice has always included men as well as women who have risked everything not just for themselves or for their own gender but for the prospects of the entire community.\" Vassar College professor Luke Harris is a co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, a think tank that's helping coordinate the effort and hosting the letter on its website. Harris is one of ten men who are recruiting and organizing signers. He told me this week that the overwhelming response to the letter has been gratitude. \"There are a lot of people who feel that this is a threshold moment for us to have a conversation,\" he said, and emphasized the similarities between the My Brother's Keeper initiative and the Million Man March in 1995. Then, event organizers invited men to reclaim their families and communities. Women were asked to stay home. \"From our perspective, it's a glaring example of the same phenomenon,\" Harris said. \"It's a long-term rebranding of the racial justice discourse into a struggle by and for black male leadership, empowerment and responsibility.\" What this amounts to, according to Harris, is \"the subsequent marginalization of the role of African-American women as actors in the racial justice movement and a decentering of their needs, which are every bit as important as the needs of their brothers.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal The same message is amplified in an op-ed by Harris published this week. In it, he takes on the widespread perception that girls and women of color are somehow in an advantaged position vis-à-vis boys and men, writing: We know, but do we care that Black girls are much more likely to be suspended than all other girls and most boys as well? We know, but do we care, that Black women have lower average incomes and possess significantly less wealth than both Black men and White women? We know, but do we care, that Black women are disproportionately burdened with childcare in situations of acute poverty? Harris also takes on the narrow definitions of family, the heteronormativity and the leap in logic at the heart of the initiative, writing, \"The underlying message here is rooted in the idea that if we help the boys and men, then the situation of girls and women will inevitably get better. With better husbands and sons everything will just 'click.'\" It's that apparent trickle-down approach to racial uplift that's given me pause as I've watched the philanthropic community and now the White House adopt this emphasis on boys and men. After I asked how and whether girls and women fit into the My Brother's Keeper initiative, some commenters countered that girls and women don't need a place at this particular table because their needs were being addressed by the White House Council on Women and Girls , which was launched in 2009. But a statement the National Organization of Women released last week in support of the men's letter shows why comparing the two efforts is apples and oranges: Women and girls of color are in a deep crisis that is too often overlooked. We do not fault the White House Council on Women and Girls for not producing an initiative of the breadth and scope of \"My Brother's Keeper,\" as they were neither tasked nor-as importantly-funded to do so. [ Emphasis mine. ] The Council's charge applies to \"all\" women and girls. But if the specific concerns of girls and young women of color are not investigated and addressed, it becomes all too easy to reinforce the unfortunate myth that girls of color have succeeded and are not in need of attention. There's a reason it's easy to forget that there even is a White House initiative for girls: Money makes the world go 'round, and that older iniative lacks the at least $200 million over five years that the philanthropic community has put in place for boys and men. That NOW even weighed in to offer this perspective and its support for the letter highlights the unexpected bedfellows aspect of the current debate, legal scholar and African American Political Forum co-founder Kimberlé Crenshaw told me. \"This is really an unprecedented moment in feminist and anti-racist politics. I can't remember a time in history when a group of black men, particularly as diverse as this-academics, laborers, entertainers-have actually made a statement calling on the community and society at large to directly focus on the plight facing African-American women. Another first is a feminist group basically applauding a black male group,\" she said. \"Each is acknowledging the extent to which race politics and gender politics hadn't done a good job elevating some of the issues facing women of color.\" Crenshaw called the closing of ranks by the letter's signers and NOW a \"mirror opposite\" of the group represented at the president's My Brother's Keeper press conference in February. There, conservative Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg-whose commitment to a stop-and-frisk policy that targets young men of color is well-documented-offered their support. It's the initiative's focus on personal responsibility over institutional racism and the structures that disadvantage youth of color that allows people like O'Reilly and Bloomberg to feel comfortable getting on board. \"That's a political realignment,\" Crenshaw said of the camps on either side of the debate. Harris, of the African American Policy Forum, said a webinar to further discuss the sign-on letter and next steps will be held Thursday, June 12.

After I asked how and whether girls and women fit into the My Brother's Keeper initiative, some commenters countered that girls and women don't need a place at this particular table because their needs were being addressed by the White House Council on Women and Girls , which was launched in 2009. But a statement the National Organization of Women released last week in support of the men's letter shows why comparing the two efforts is apples and oranges: Women and girls of color are in a deep crisis that is too often overlooked. We do not fault the White House Council on Women and Girls for not producing an initiative of the breadth and scope of \"My Brother's Keeper,\" as they were neither tasked nor-as importantly-funded to do so. [ Emphasis mine. ] The Council's charge applies to \"all\" women and girls. But if the specific concerns of girls and young women of color are not investigated and addressed, it becomes all too easy to reinforce the unfortunate myth that girls of color have succeeded and are not in need of attention. There's a reason it's easy to forget that there even is a White House initiative for girls: Money makes the world go 'round, and that older iniative lacks the at least $200 million over five years that the philanthropic community has put in place for boys and men. That NOW even weighed in to offer this perspective and its support for the letter highlights the unexpected bedfellows aspect of the current debate, legal scholar and African American Political Forum co-founder Kimberlé Crenshaw told me. \"This is really an unprecedented moment in feminist and anti-racist politics. I can't remember a time in history when a group of black men, particularly as diverse as this-academics, laborers, entertainers-have actually made a statement calling on the community and society at large to directly focus on the plight facing African-American women. Another first is a feminist group basically applauding a black male group,\" she said. \"Each is acknowledging the extent to which race politics and gender politics hadn't done a good job elevating some of the issues facing women of color.\" Crenshaw called the closing of ranks by the letter's signers and NOW a \"mirror opposite\" of the group represented at the president's My Brother's Keeper press conference in February. There, conservative Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg-whose commitment to a stop-and-frisk policy that targets young men of color is well-documented-offered their support. It's the initiative's focus on personal responsibility over institutional racism and the structures that disadvantage youth of color that allows people like O'Reilly and Bloomberg to feel comfortable getting on board. \"That's a political realignment,\" Crenshaw said of the camps on either side of the debate. Harris, of the African American Policy Forum, said a webinar to further discuss the sign-on letter and next steps will be held Thursday, June 12. Details can be found on the think tank's website as they become available.\n\n\"From our perspective, it's a glaring example of the same phenomenon,\" Harris said. \"It's a long-term rebranding of the racial justice discourse into a struggle by and for black male leadership, empowerment and responsibility.\" What this amounts to, according to Harris, is \"the subsequent marginalization of the role of African-American women as actors in the racial justice movement and a decentering of their needs, which are every bit as important as the needs of their brothers.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal The same message is amplified in an op-ed by Harris published this week.

Activate your online access\n\nThe summer after my freshman year of college, I decided it was time for me to read everything I could get my hands on in order to become a respectable black intellectual. At Barnes & Noble, I grabbed the only book by bell hooks in stock in the \"African-American Interests\" section- Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem . \"I have found myself saying again and again that mental health is the revolutionary anti­racist frontier African Americans must collectively explore,\" hooks wrote. She touched on issues of self-hatred, depression, addiction, and emotional well-being. I promptly decided it was one of the most important books I had ever read. Whatever was hurting black people, I wanted to fight. But I soon forgot about the book. I knew people who were in prison; I didn't know anyone who was depressed. This article is adapted from Mychal Denzel Smith's book, Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching (Nation Books). And that included myself. Starting when I was 16, I had occasional panic attacks. Even so, I failed to connect Rock My Soul to anything in my experience. I saw in hooks's words something plaguing black communities, not me. My panic attacks were frightening, but whenever they struck, I told myself they were nothing to worry about. After all, I was, by now, a college student. Emotionally stable. Perfectly sane. Three years later, Rock My Soul became newly relevant. It had always been difficult for me to maintain interest in school, but I had done enough to get by. Now I was finding it harder to pretend. At some point in senior year, I stopped showing up. I was the editor in chief of our student paper, and my work there was the only thing that got me out of bed on the days when I wanted to sleep until 4, 5, or 6 pm . Often, I would return home and open up a bottle of cheap vodka that I had started keeping around. I didn't drink in earnest until I was 21-not because I was a stickler for legality, but because I was scared that getting drunk meant losing control. By the beginning of 2008, I had abandoned that fear and would drink that ice-cold vodka more days than not. Every day, I was lying to people. Responding to a \"How are you?\" with \"I'm fine\" was enough to satisfy most people. The more I lied, the more I wanted to believe the lie-and the less I could. Every time I said I was fine, I saw myself dying. Sometimes I saw myself intentionally crashing my car. Sometimes I saw myself jumping from a tall building, frightened and free, feeling the wind beneath me. I knew people who were in prison. I didn't know anyone who was depressed. I reached a point where I wanted to talk, but I'd pushed away the people it was hard to lie to. I stopped answering my mother's phone calls. The vodka in my freezer stopped being helpful. I had never smoked weed before. But the less comfort drinking brought me, the more curious I became. The first time I tried it, it didn't have much of an effect. The second time, I wanted to make sure I felt it. So I inhaled sharply. Moments later, I noticed that something was off in the middle of my chest. Soon, there was tingling in my left arm. I couldn't get enough air. In desperation, I asked my roommate Justin to take me to the hospital. As I panicked, sticking my head out of his car window like a dog wagging its tongue, Justin tried to reassure me. At the hospital, the doctor asked me if I'd done anything unusual that evening. \"I smoked weed for the first time,\" I said. \"I guess you learned your lesson, right?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I managed. Then the doctor left, the nurses dismissed me, and Justin drove me home.

Since it was helped along by the weed, I wrote it off as an anomaly. But by the end of March, it was getting harder to make the lie believable. With increasing frequency, my parents asked me if I was sure I was going to graduate on time. I hadn't purchased a cap and gown. I still wasn't going to class. I hadn't even pretended to revise my thesis. \"Yeah, I should,\" I told them. \"I'll have to do a summer course to finish my thesis, but I'll be able to walk.\" To tell the truth would have been to admit failure.

I went home one weekend and found my mother in the backyard, getting her plants ready for summer. \"So how are we doing this-when school is over, are you coming back here?\" she asked. \"What room are you taking?\" I started crying. \"What's wrong, my child?\" \"I don't know... everything ,\" I replied. Her hands were caked in soil, so she called my father over to embrace me. He hugged me and walked me back into the house. I sat on the couch and cried until I physically couldn't any longer. I told my parents what I felt-some of it. I told them I wasn't sleeping, that there was no way I was going to graduate on time, that I felt like a failure, that I was afraid of disappointing them and everyone else.

But I still didn't know what to do about it. * * * I now know many people who have lived with depression, but that's a retroactive designation. When I was 21, no one in my life would have said they suffered from depression. Plenty of people said they were \"depressed,\" which generally meant \"really sad,\" but no one would cop to a mental illness. The only people I \"knew\" who had gone to a psychiatrist and talked about it openly were in Woody Allen movies. For several decades, white people in the professional and artistic classes have been able to wear their weekly analysis sessions as a badge of intellect, while the rest of us struggle with the stigma of mental illness-a stigma that is especially strong in black communities. Black people have every reason to be distrustful of mental-health care in this country: Psychiatric institutions have largely functioned as another form of prison, and mental illnesses are often attributed to black people despite their completely rational behaviors. But that doesn't mean we don't suffer, often in silence. Related Article The Rebirth of Black Rage Mychal Denzel Smith My family wanted to help. Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words. You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us. We've made it through slavery and lynchings, rape and Jim Crow, poverty and police dogs, fire hoses and jail cells, and we have raised families and created culture that is emulated (and stolen) the world over. Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival. While black women are expected to be strong enough to shoulder the emotional needs of the entire community, men inherit a sense of masculinity that teaches stoicism as a virtue. Generations of black boys and men are walking around with turmoil swelling inside them, ready to explode at any minute. \"The violence done to black boys is the abusive insistence, imposed on them by family and by society, that they not feel,\" bell hooks writes in Rock My Soul . I learned very early on to suppress my emotions. I was a sensitive child; the slightest bit of teasing from my big cousins, whose approval I desperately wanted, would set me off in tears. So I tried to laugh along or be silent. And I learned by example. My father was a picture-perfect example of masculine authority. My brother and I knew him as a dutiful provider and a strict disciplinarian. I can only guess now at what made him afraid, what caused him pain, what trauma he'd lived through to become the man he did. He always said we could talk to him about anything, but he never opened up to us-and I learned to never open up, either. I always waited until my pain was unbearable, until it left me facedown and sinking. Then things would come pouring out of me and I'd feel much better, but I never carried that lesson forward. I wanted to change this pattern, but I didn't know how. Sometimes it feels like the problem is that we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. Sometimes it feels like the problem is our commitment to an antiquated idea of strength. But when we do speak, who listens? Or, more critically: When we speak, what do people hear? * * * Hip-hop is the biggest cultural phenomenon of the past half-century. Rappers get criticized for their materialism, sexism, homophobia, and glorification of gangster lifestyles-and there is plenty of merit to that critique. But we're all guilty of reducing our image of rappers to caricatures. When they tell us what's wrong, do we listen? When the Notorious B.I.G. was a \"nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads / Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars,\" people paid attention. When he told us about his \"Suicidal Thoughts,\" we brushed it aside. We turned \"Cash Rules Everything Around Me\" into a money-making anthem, without taking note of Inspectah Deck saying: \"Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess / I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed / But I'm still depressed and I ask, What's it worth?\" When Tupac was hollering \"Thug Life,\" everyone from vice presidential candidates to my parents wanted him censored, but they couldn't be found when he said: \"I smoke a blunt to take the pain out / And if I wasn't high I'd probably try to blow my brains out.\" Jay Z and Kanye West's album Watch the Throne was dismissed by some critics as \"luxury rap,\" but there's nothing luxurious about Jay Z asking: \"Where the fuck is the press?

GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email When T.I. kept getting arrested on gun and drug charges, did anyone ask whether his behavior was the result of having witnessed so many people in his life die or go to prison while his talent made him a millionaire celebrity, even as survivor's guilt ate away at him? Who would we be if we understood mental illness, if we could offer support and had access to all the resources needed to address these common but unspoken struggles? I got lucky: My family cared and supported me, even if they didn't always understand. Through social media, I found a community-starting with the poet and mental-health advocate Bassey Ikpi-that made me feel less alone and taught me there were ways to heal. And I had enough resources at my disposal to make that healing possible. It's not true for everyone, and it's especially not true for black boys trying to become black men in America. But we can end this deadly lack of care. We can build communities that prioritize mental health and encourage the understanding that depression isn't a sign of weakness, but an illness like any other. And we can fight to ensure that therapists and psychiatrists versed in racism and gender oppression, proper medication, and facilities that don't mimic prisons are available to us all. But first we have to start talking about what we need.\n\nThis article is adapted from Mychal Denzel Smith's book, Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching (Nation Books).\n\nAnd that included myself. Starting when I was 16, I had occasional panic attacks. Even so, I failed to connect Rock My Soul to anything in my experience. I saw in hooks's words something plaguing black communities, not me. My panic attacks were frightening, but whenever they struck, I told myself they were nothing to worry about. After all, I was, by now, a college student. Emotionally stable. Perfectly sane. Three years later, Rock My Soul became newly relevant. It had always been difficult for me to maintain interest in school, but I had done enough to get by. Now I was finding it harder to pretend. At some point in senior year, I stopped showing up. I was the editor in chief of our student paper, and my work there was the only thing that got me out of bed on the days when I wanted to sleep until 4, 5, or 6 pm . Often, I would return home and open up a bottle of cheap vodka that I had started keeping around. I didn't drink in earnest until I was 21-not because I was a stickler for legality, but because I was scared that getting drunk meant losing control. By the beginning of 2008, I had abandoned that fear and would drink that ice-cold vodka more days than not. Every day, I was lying to people. Responding to a \"How are you?\" with \"I'm fine\" was enough to satisfy most people. The more I lied, the more I wanted to believe the lie-and the less I could. Every time I said I was fine, I saw myself dying. Sometimes I saw myself intentionally crashing my car.

Her hands were caked in soil, so she called my father over to embrace me. He hugged me and walked me back into the house. I sat on the couch and cried until I physically couldn't any longer. I told my parents what I felt-some of it. I told them I wasn't sleeping, that there was no way I was going to graduate on time, that I felt like a failure, that I was afraid of disappointing them and everyone else. My father said, \"It sounds like you're going through some sort of depression.\" There was the word. I was relieved to hear it, because what I was feeling had a name that I could say. But I still didn't know what to do about it. * * * I now know many people who have lived with depression, but that's a retroactive designation. When I was 21, no one in my life would have said they suffered from depression. Plenty of people said they were \"depressed,\" which generally meant \"really sad,\" but no one would cop to a mental illness. The only people I \"knew\" who had gone to a psychiatrist and talked about it openly were in Woody Allen movies. For several decades, white people in the professional and artistic classes have been able to wear their weekly analysis sessions as a badge of intellect, while the rest of us struggle with the stigma of mental illness-a stigma that is especially strong in black communities. Black people have every reason to be distrustful of mental-health care in this country: Psychiatric institutions have largely functioned as another form of prison, and mental illnesses are often attributed to black people despite their completely rational behaviors. But that doesn't mean we don't suffer, often in silence. Related Article The Rebirth of Black Rage Mychal Denzel Smith My family wanted to help. Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words. You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us. We've made it through slavery and lynchings, rape and Jim Crow, poverty and police dogs, fire hoses and jail cells, and we have raised families and created culture that is emulated (and stolen) the world over. Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival. While black women are expected to be strong enough to shoulder the emotional needs of the entire community, men inherit a sense of masculinity that teaches stoicism as a virtue. Generations of black boys and men are walking around with turmoil swelling inside them, ready to explode at any minute. \"The violence done to black boys is the abusive insistence, imposed on them by family and by society, that they not feel,\" bell hooks writes in Rock My Soul . I learned very early on to suppress my emotions. I was a sensitive child; the slightest bit of teasing from my big cousins, whose approval I desperately wanted, would set me off in tears. So I tried to laugh along or be silent. And I learned by example. My father was a picture-perfect example of masculine authority. My brother and I knew him as a dutiful provider and a strict disciplinarian. I can only guess now at what made him afraid, what caused him pain, what trauma he'd lived through to become the man he did. He always said we could talk to him about anything, but he never opened up to us-and I learned to never open up, either. I always waited until my pain was unbearable, until it left me facedown and sinking. Then things would come pouring out of me and I'd feel much better, but I never carried that lesson forward. I wanted to change this pattern, but I didn't know how. Sometimes it feels like the problem is that we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. Sometimes it feels like the problem is our commitment to an antiquated idea of strength. But when we do speak, who listens? Or, more critically: When we speak, what do people hear? * * * Hip-hop is the biggest cultural phenomenon of the past half-century. Rappers get criticized for their materialism, sexism, homophobia, and glorification of gangster lifestyles-and there is plenty of merit to that critique. But we're all guilty of reducing our image of rappers to caricatures. When they tell us what's wrong, do we listen? When the Notorious B.I.G. was a \"nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads / Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars,\" people paid attention. When he told us about his \"Suicidal Thoughts,\" we brushed it aside. We turned \"Cash Rules Everything Around Me\" into a money-making anthem, without taking note of Inspectah Deck saying: \"Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess / I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed / But I'm still depressed and I ask, What's it worth?\" When Tupac was hollering \"Thug Life,\" everyone from vice presidential candidates to my parents wanted him censored, but they couldn't be found when he said: \"I smoke a blunt to take the pain out / And if I wasn't high I'd probably try to blow my brains out.\" Jay Z and Kanye West's album Watch the Throne was dismissed by some critics as \"luxury rap,\" but there's nothing luxurious about Jay Z asking: \"Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres? / Either they don't know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed.\" LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email When T.I. kept getting arrested on gun and drug charges, did anyone ask whether his behavior was the result of having witnessed so many people in his life die or go to prison while his talent made him a millionaire celebrity, even as survivor's guilt ate away at him? Who would we be if we understood mental illness, if we could offer support and had access to all the resources needed to address these common but unspoken struggles? I got lucky: My family cared and supported me, even if they didn't always understand. Through social media, I found a community-starting with the poet and mental-health advocate Bassey Ikpi-that made me feel less alone and taught me there were ways to heal. And I had enough resources at my disposal to make that healing possible. It's not true for everyone, and it's especially not true for black boys trying to become black men in America. But we can end this deadly lack of care. We can build communities that prioritize mental health and encourage the understanding that depression isn't a sign of weakness, but an illness like any other. And we can fight to ensure that therapists and psychiatrists versed in racism and gender oppression, proper medication, and facilities that don't mimic prisons are available to us all. But first we have to start talking about what we need.\n\nI was the editor in chief of our student paper, and my work there was the only thing that got me out of bed on the days when I wanted to sleep until 4, 5, or 6 pm . Often, I would return home and open up a bottle of cheap vodka that I had started keeping around. I didn't drink in earnest until I was 21-not because I was a stickler for legality, but because I was scared that getting drunk meant losing control. By the beginning of 2008, I had abandoned that fear and would drink that ice-cold vodka more days than not. Every day, I was lying to people. Responding to a \"How are you?\" with \"I'm fine\" was enough to satisfy most people. The more I lied, the more I wanted to believe the lie-and the less I could. Every time I said I was fine, I saw myself dying. Sometimes I saw myself intentionally crashing my car. Sometimes I saw myself jumping from a tall building, frightened and free, feeling the wind beneath me. I knew people who were in prison. I didn't know anyone who was depressed. I reached a point where I wanted to talk, but I'd pushed away the people it was hard to lie to. I stopped answering my mother's phone calls. The vodka in my freezer stopped being helpful. I had never smoked weed before. But the less comfort drinking brought me, the more curious I became. The first time I tried it, it didn't have much of an effect. The second time, I wanted to make sure I felt it. So I inhaled sharply. Moments later, I noticed that something was off in the middle of my chest. Soon, there was tingling in my left arm. I couldn't get enough air. In desperation, I asked my roommate Justin to take me to the hospital. As I panicked, sticking my head out of his car window like a dog wagging its tongue, Justin tried to reassure me. At the hospital, the doctor asked me if I'd done anything unusual that evening. \"I smoked weed for the first time,\" I said. \"I guess you learned your lesson, right?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I managed. Then the doctor left, the nurses dismissed me, and Justin drove me home.

Since it was helped along by the weed, I wrote it off as an anomaly. But by the end of March, it was getting harder to make the lie believable. With increasing frequency, my parents asked me if I was sure I was going to graduate on time. I hadn't purchased a cap and gown. I still wasn't going to class. I hadn't even pretended to revise my thesis. \"Yeah, I should,\" I told them. \"I'll have to do a summer course to finish my thesis, but I'll be able to walk.\" To tell the truth would have been to admit failure. I didn't want to face my mother's disappointment or my father's lecture. I was their firstborn, and I was part of the first generation in both families to have several members attend college.

We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone.

The vodka in my freezer stopped being helpful. I had never smoked weed before. But the less comfort drinking brought me, the more curious I became.

Moments later, I noticed that something was off in the middle of my chest. Soon, there was tingling in my left arm. I couldn't get enough air. In desperation, I asked my roommate Justin to take me to the hospital. As I panicked, sticking my head out of his car window like a dog wagging its tongue, Justin tried to reassure me. At the hospital, the doctor asked me if I'd done anything unusual that evening. \"I smoked weed for the first time,\" I said. \"I guess you learned your lesson, right?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" I managed.

The only people I \"knew\" who had gone to a psychiatrist and talked about it openly were in Woody Allen movies. For several decades, white people in the professional and artistic classes have been able to wear their weekly analysis sessions as a badge of intellect, while the rest of us struggle with the stigma of mental illness-a stigma that is especially strong in black communities. Black people have every reason to be distrustful of mental-health care in this country: Psychiatric institutions have largely functioned as another form of prison, and mental illnesses are often attributed to black people despite their completely rational behaviors.

Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him.

My graduation would be a sign of progress. But I wasn't even making it out of bed most days. I went home one weekend and found my mother in the backyard, getting her plants ready for summer. \"So how are we doing this-when school is over, are you coming back here?\" she asked. \"What room are you taking?\" I started crying. \"What's wrong, my child?\" \"I don't know... everything ,\" I replied. Her hands were caked in soil, so she called my father over to embrace me. He hugged me and walked me back into the house. I sat on the couch and cried until I physically couldn't any longer. I told my parents what I felt-some of it. I told them I wasn't sleeping, that there was no way I was going to graduate on time, that I felt like a failure, that I was afraid of disappointing them and everyone else. My father said, \"It sounds like you're going through some sort of depression.\" There was the word. I was relieved to hear it, because what I was feeling had a name that I could say. But I still didn't know what to do about it. * * * I now know many people who have lived with depression, but that's a retroactive designation. When I was 21, no one in my life would have said they suffered from depression. Plenty of people said they were \"depressed,\" which generally meant \"really sad,\" but no one would cop to a mental illness. The only people I \"knew\" who had gone to a psychiatrist and talked about it openly were in Woody Allen movies. For several decades, white people in the professional and artistic classes have been able to wear their weekly analysis sessions as a badge of intellect, while the rest of us struggle with the stigma of mental illness-a stigma that is especially strong in black communities. Black people have every reason to be distrustful of mental-health care in this country: Psychiatric institutions have largely functioned as another form of prison, and mental illnesses are often attributed to black people despite their completely rational behaviors. But that doesn't mean we don't suffer, often in silence. Related Article The Rebirth of Black Rage Mychal Denzel Smith My family wanted to help. Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words. You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us. We've made it through slavery and lynchings, rape and Jim Crow, poverty and police dogs, fire hoses and jail cells, and we have raised families and created culture that is emulated (and stolen) the world over. Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival. While black women are expected to be strong enough to shoulder the emotional needs of the entire community, men inherit a sense of masculinity that teaches stoicism as a virtue. Generations of black boys and men are walking around with turmoil swelling inside them, ready to explode at any minute. \"The violence done to black boys is the abusive insistence, imposed on them by family and by society, that they not feel,\" bell hooks writes in Rock My Soul . I learned very early on to suppress my emotions. I was a sensitive child; the slightest bit of teasing from my big cousins, whose approval I desperately wanted, would set me off in tears. So I tried to laugh along or be silent. And I learned by example. My father was a picture-perfect example of masculine authority. My brother and I knew him as a dutiful provider and a strict disciplinarian. I can only guess now at what made him afraid, what caused him pain, what trauma he'd lived through to become the man he did. He always said we could talk to him about anything, but he never opened up to us-and I learned to never open up, either. I always waited until my pain was unbearable, until it left me facedown and sinking. Then things would come pouring out of me and I'd feel much better, but I never carried that lesson forward. I wanted to change this pattern, but I didn't know how. Sometimes it feels like the problem is that we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. Sometimes it feels like the problem is our commitment to an antiquated idea of strength. But when we do speak, who listens? Or, more critically: When we speak, what do people hear? * * * Hip-hop is the biggest cultural phenomenon of the past half-century. Rappers get criticized for their materialism, sexism, homophobia, and glorification of gangster lifestyles-and there is plenty of merit to that critique. But we're all guilty of reducing our image of rappers to caricatures. When they tell us what's wrong, do we listen? When the Notorious B.I.G. was a \"nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads / Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars,\" people paid attention. When he told us about his \"Suicidal Thoughts,\" we brushed it aside. We turned \"Cash Rules Everything Around Me\" into a money-making anthem, without taking note of Inspectah Deck saying: \"Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess / I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed / But I'm still depressed and I ask, What's it worth?\" When Tupac was hollering \"Thug Life,\" everyone from vice presidential candidates to my parents wanted him censored, but they couldn't be found when he said: \"I smoke a blunt to take the pain out / And if I wasn't high I'd probably try to blow my brains out.\" Jay Z and Kanye West's album Watch the Throne was dismissed by some critics as \"luxury rap,\" but there's nothing luxurious about Jay Z asking: \"Where the fuck is the press?

Who would we be if we understood mental illness, if we could offer support and had access to all the resources needed to address these common but unspoken struggles?

We can build communities that prioritize mental health and encourage the understanding that depression isn't a sign of weakness, but an illness like any other.

But that doesn't mean we don't suffer, often in silence. Related Article The Rebirth of Black Rage Mychal Denzel Smith My family wanted to help. Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words. You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us.

Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival. While black women are expected to be strong enough to shoulder the emotional needs of the entire community, men inherit a sense of masculinity that teaches stoicism as a virtue. Generations of black boys and men are walking around with turmoil swelling inside them, ready to explode at any minute. \"The violence done to black boys is the abusive insistence, imposed on them by family and by society, that they not feel,\" bell hooks writes in Rock My Soul . I learned very early on to suppress my emotions. I was a sensitive child; the slightest bit of teasing from my big cousins, whose approval I desperately wanted, would set me off in tears. So I tried to laugh along or be silent. And I learned by example. My father was a picture-perfect example of masculine authority. My brother and I knew him as a dutiful provider and a strict disciplinarian. I can only guess now at what made him afraid, what caused him pain, what trauma he'd lived through to become the man he did. He always said we could talk to him about anything, but he never opened up to us-and I learned to never open up, either. I always waited until my pain was unbearable, until it left me facedown and sinking. Then things would come pouring out of me and I'd feel much better, but I never carried that lesson forward. I wanted to change this pattern, but I didn't know how. Sometimes it feels like the problem is that we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. Sometimes it feels like the problem is our commitment to an antiquated idea of strength. But when we do speak, who listens?

We can build communities that prioritize mental health and encourage the understanding that depression isn't a sign of weakness, but an illness like any other. And we can fight to ensure that therapists and psychiatrists versed in racism and gender oppression, proper medication, and facilities that don't mimic prisons are available to us all. But first we have to start talking about what we need.\n\nI now know many people who have lived with depression, but that's a retroactive designation. When I was 21, no one in my life would have said they suffered from depression. Plenty of people said they were \"depressed,\" which generally meant \"really sad,\" but no one would cop to a mental illness. The only people I \"knew\" who had gone to a psychiatrist and talked about it openly were in Woody Allen movies. For several decades, white people in the professional and artistic classes have been able to wear their weekly analysis sessions as a badge of intellect, while the rest of us struggle with the stigma of mental illness-a stigma that is especially strong in black communities. Black people have every reason to be distrustful of mental-health care in this country: Psychiatric institutions have largely functioned as another form of prison, and mental illnesses are often attributed to black people despite their completely rational behaviors. But that doesn't mean we don't suffer, often in silence. Related Article The Rebirth of Black Rage Mychal Denzel Smith My family wanted to help. Aunt Gay, my mother's twin, called the next day to reassure me that she was proud of me. Then Darius, one of Aunt Gay's sons, called and said that I had nothing to be ashamed of, that I had accomplished more than so many young black men get the chance to do. I appreciated the pep talks and told them as much, but they weren't what I needed. I asked Aunt Gay to tell Antaeus, her oldest son, to call me. \"How do you do it?\" I said as soon as he did. Confused, Antaeus asked, \"How do I do what?\" Crying, I answered: \"How do you live without Demetri?\" Demetri was born on February 27, 1982, the first son of Uncle Clayton, my mother's only brother. Demetri was the best at everything: basketball, football, video games. I would practice Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter at home, trying to get good enough to beat him on our next trip to DC. But I looked up to Demetri because he didn't tease as hard as everyone else. I felt protected around him. In March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words.

You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us. We've made it through slavery and lynchings, rape and Jim Crow, poverty and police dogs, fire hoses and jail cells, and we have raised families and created culture that is emulated (and stolen) the world over. Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival.

I learned very early on to suppress my emotions. I was a sensitive child; the slightest bit of teasing from my big cousins, whose approval I desperately wanted, would set me off in tears. So I tried to laugh along or be silent. And I learned by example. My father was a picture-perfect example of masculine authority. My brother and I knew him as a dutiful provider and a strict disciplinarian. I can only guess now at what made him afraid, what caused him pain, what trauma he'd lived through to become the man he did. He always said we could talk to him about anything, but he never opened up to us-and I learned to never open up, either. I always waited until my pain was unbearable, until it left me facedown and sinking. Then things would come pouring out of me and I'd feel much better, but I never carried that lesson forward.

I got lucky: My family cared and supported me, even if they didn't always understand.

But we can end this deadly lack of care. We can build communities that prioritize mental health and encourage the understanding that depression isn't a sign of weakness, but an illness like any other. And we can fight to ensure that therapists and psychiatrists versed in racism and gender oppression, proper medication, and facilities that don't mimic prisons are available to us all. But first we have to start talking about what we need.\n\nIn March of 1999, my mother left for a few days. On occasion, she would go to see her family without us, so that didn't strike me as abnormal. Then my father called my brother and me to come downstairs. Demetri had been shot, he told us. Seven times. I didn't grasp the gravity of the situation because he never said, \"Demetri is dead.\" Instead, he gave us a lecture about why he was always telling us that \"choices\" were important in life. (Demetri had sold drugs before, though he wasn't at the time of the shooting.) My big cousin had been shot, and my father was admonishing me about \"choices.\" I didn't learn that Demetri was dead until the three of us arrived in DC. Up to that point, I thought we were just going to visit him in the hospital. I walked into the church for the funeral and immediately started crying. We had been to a number of funerals in my 12 short years, but none with circumstances this tragic. I finally made it up to the casket where Demetri lay dead, but my body felt out of place and time. I wanted to be anywhere else. At Aunt Connie's house afterward, Uncle Clayton had a little to drink. He had already lost the love of his life, Demetri's mother, and now he had to bury his son. \"You still got that jump shot?\" he asked me. I tried a smile for him. The last time he'd visited us in Virginia Beach, we'd played basketball in the driveway, and he was impressed by my jump shot. \"Next time I come down, I wanna see it, you hear me?\" He was trying to make me feel better. I struggled through a half-hearted laugh, nodded my head, and said, \"Yeah, OK.\" We never got the chance. Uncle Clayton died the next year. I still had Demetri in my heart and memories, and I thought that was all I needed. But four years later, I had to acknowledge the pain and ask Antaeus-the only person still around who had been as deeply affected by his death as I was-how he made it through each day without him. We talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words.

But first we have to start talking about what we need.\n\nWe talked for probably an hour. Antaeus told me how hard it was, why he'd gotten a tattoo of Demetri's nickname on his forearm, why we had to keep going. It helped-a little-to know I wasn't alone. I heard from Aunt Connie next. She started with the familiar pep talk, but when I started talking about Demetri, things changed. \"You like to write, don't you?\" she said. \"Then you use those words. You use those words to make sure what happened to Demetri don't have to happen to any other black boys.\" Sometimes it feels like we black men have internalized the perception of ourselves as unfeeling brutes. * * * Black people in the United States pride ourselves on the fact that we have survived despite having every imaginable form of violence inflicted on us. We've made it through slavery and lynchings, rape and Jim Crow, poverty and police dogs, fire hoses and jail cells, and we have raised families and created culture that is emulated (and stolen) the world over. Even with all the odds stacked against us, we have persevered through the strength of our collective will and our faith in God. But neither will nor faith can heal the psychic wounds of that survival.

Activate your online access\n\nWhy is the media talking so much about the fraction of Black men who might go MAGA when more than 60 percent of white men will vote for Trump?\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage during a campaign rally on October 13, 2024, in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris unveiled a platform of policies to court Black male voters this week, which she called the \" Opportunity Agenda for Black Men .\" The platform includes business loans for Black entrepreneurs, legalization of marijuana, and better regulation of the cryptocurrency market, which disproportionately predates on Black men.\n\nI've read her plan , because reading such things is part of my job, but speaking as just a regular Black male voter, I honestly and deeply do not give a shit. We are three weeks out from a presidential election against a deranged fascist named Donald Trump. I do not need nor require a personalized agenda addressing my particular issues at this late date-and if I did need one this would not be it, not the least because it doesn't contain any meaningful way to prevent the cops from harassing or murdering me and my Black children as we try to live out our lives in this racist country. The time for a Black male agenda was three years ago when Democrats briefly controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Because I understand basic civics, I will continue to address my questions to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema about why such an agenda never materialized.\n\nBut I'm not here to talk about the past. I do not need more reliable crypto and an NFT in my lunchbox telling me I'm a big strong man in order to choose correctly between a moderate Black woman and the obvious white supremacist who believes in eugenics. I will be voting for Harris on November 5, and then spend the 1,500 days between that date and the next presidential election in 2028 advocating for my version of a Black agenda. Going on TikTok to advocate for Black people in October means nothing if you don't show up with the same energy and ideas in January.\n\nIt might be tempting to write me off as a bougie negro who has lost touch with his community, but I'd like to point out that the overwhelming majority of Black male voters are going to do exactly what I do: vote for Harris. Harris will receive between 85 and 90 percent of the Black male vote. I acknowledge that the difference between 85 percent and 90 percent could be the difference in Harris winning or losing a critical state or two, but I simply refuse to engage in a conversation that paints Black male support as the \"problem\" for Harris in this election. Over 60 percent of white men are going to vote for a convicted felon. Somewhere around 50 percent of white women are going to vote for an adjudicated rapist and devout misogynist. Black men are not your problem, Democrats.\n\nThe \"problem\" in this country is how the majority of white people vote. The force holding this country back is the majority of white people. The people who have turned against democracy are the majority of white people. The global force destroying the environment of this earth is the majority of white people. If you are in the white liberal minority and you want to freak out about something, freak out about your cousins and grandmothers and colleagues who are about to cast a ballot for an unhinged authoritarian. Go deal with the white people in your life instead of placing the burden on Black folks to save this country from the majority of white folks yet again.\n\nOf course, asking white folks to look in the mirror and address their own bullshit has been the plea of every Black thinker and intellectual from Frederick Douglass to Chris Rock. This country has become comfortable with the idea that white support for white supremacy is inevitable. The white voters who will support this fascism are consistently treated by the media as if they are merely doing the very best they can given the economic and social forces they believe exist, even though most of what these white voters believe is factually, demonstrably wrong.\n\nThis fallacious idea that white people are always doing their best-and that it's up to everyone else to stop them if they disagree-is such a common feature of American political discourse that you'll still see a majority of white folks defend the enslavers and rapists who wrote the Constitution. They'll call these founders \"men of their times,\" even though there were other, better men (and women!) who knew in real time that slavery was wrong and that women should have political equality. The enslaved people, for instance, were \"men of their times\" and knew slavery was wrong. But most whites, even the \"progressive\" ones at the time, went along with the unforgivable evil of human bondage. The only time progressive white folks actually stood up to their racist brothers and cousins was in the 1860s, and the racist whites were so pissed about the normal operation of democratic governance that elected Abraham Lincoln that they seceded from the Union and started a civil war. Usually, instead of dealing with retrograde white folks, liberal whites look for somebody else to blame.\n\nIn this election, the powers that be have decided that Black men are the appropriate scapegoat. Yes, the overwhelming majority of Black male voters will vote for Harris, but what about those who don't vote? What about the dudes who will stay on the couch? Surely, if every Black man would just crawl over broken glass to vote for Harris, our democracy could be saved. Since not every single sentient brother will perform their assigned civic duty of saving white folks like the magic negroes we are supposed to be, clearly Harris must have a problem with Black men-or so the story goes.\n\nHarris does not have a \"problem\" with Black men. That said, she does appear, based on the polls, to be slightly underperforming Joe Biden in 2020 with... men. All men. White men, Black men, Latino men, AAPI men, men without a college degree, men with a college degree, working men, businessmen, and pretty much every other flavor of men-except perhaps Black queer men, who appear to be all in for the VP .\n\nGosh, I can't imagine why. Is the fact that America is the only major democracy to never have elected a woman as its leader something more than mere coincidence? Could it be that too many cis-hetero American men are pathetic little rump creatures who have been taught by their fathers and movies to view women as prizes to be won instead of equals to be respected? I guess there are some things we'll never know for sure.\n\nTo the extent Harris has a problem with men, there's literally nothing she can do about it. Harris could give Lady MacBeth's \"unsex me here\" soliloquy as a stump speech while wearing a fake beard like the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut, and it wouldn't make a damn's bit of difference to the misogyny crowd. She's running against a man who literally tells other men that it's OK to grab women by the genitals. The guys who want that to be true are never going to vote for a woman. There's not an agenda available that will persuade those kinds of men to not suck. To put that in a language those guys can understand: You can't reason with these men-you just have to kick their ass.\n\nThe same goes for her alleged problem with Black men. There's nothing she alone can do about it. A policy agenda that focuses on the specific hurdles that this country has erected before Black men cannot be addressed by fiat by the president of the United States. It takes legislation, passed by Congress. It takes courts willing to uphold the Voting Rights Act and enforce the equal protection of laws promised by the Constitution. It takes governors, state legislatures, and mayors willing to hold racist police forces accountable for their crimes and harassment. It takes politicians committed to advancing the issues important to Black men not for a few weeks every four years, but every day, relentlessly.\n\nWe do need a Black male \"opportunity agenda,\" not as a campaign sound bite, but as an ongoing commitment to give as much of a crap about Black men on November 6 as people will pretend to through November 4. More than any specific policy, I believe that with Kamala Harris, we have at least the possibility of that commitment, and that is my top ask in an election.\n\nAt the very least, I'm positive that Harris's commitment to advancing the opportunities for Black men extends beyond Trump's commitment to having Black men who are already successful shuck and jive for him at his rallies. The Democrats are far from perfect, but Trump and his Republicans are an anathema that offer tokenism instead of progress. As Dr. Christina Greer expertly explained in a recent piece, Black men are fantastic at voting for harm reduction. We know that the Democratic Party isn't going to really focus on us, but we also know that the Republican Party is going to focus on us-on hurting us, hunting us, crushing us and, given the slightest provocation and opportunity, shooting us.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nChris Lehmann\n\nBlack men are not magic, but we are protectors. Just like generations of Black women, we will put our bodies on the line to defend our families, our communities, and our humanity. Most of us will, at least-and around 85 to 90 percent of us will prove it again in the upcoming election. I hope that is enough to counteract the influence of all the men who are not like us.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nLate last week, President Obama announced that the White House is launching a $200 million, five-year initiative focused on improving the opportunities of black and Latino boys and young men. For at least five years, advocates who work within civil rights and racial justice non-profit organizations have known that strategies that address the needs of boys and men of color-from fighting stop-and-frisk in New York City, to closing the educational achievement gap in California-are a hot ticket. A 2006 New York Times front-page article headlined \" Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn \" highlighted the work of academics who found that black men, in particular, were falling behind economically, and \" ignited a conversation\" at the Open Society Foundation about investing specifically in them. The approach spread, and other funders ramped up investment in this area. For the president's initiative, major philanthropic foundations including Ford, Open Society and Kellogg will be footing the bill with help from business leaders (there are no public funds dedicated to the project). Now that the concept has moved from the non-profit world to presidential policy, it's impossible to keep ignoring the obvious question: where do girls and young women fit in? If streets corners, classrooms, workplaces and court systems are inhospitable to and dangerous for black and Latino boys and men, how do they affect the girls and women who are often right by their sides? After all, boys and men don't exist in a vacuum. In fact, black and Latina girls and women also struggle to succeed in school, avoid the criminal justice system, and find and keep good jobs. Nearly 40 percent of black and Latina girls fail to graduate high school on time. Black girls experience sexual violence at rates higher than their white and Latina counterparts, and black women are murdered by men at more than two and a half times the rate of white women . Of those black women killed by men in 2011, nearly half were intimate partners of the offenders. This is perhaps not the kind of violence Obama's initiative is drawing attention to, but it's violence just the same. In recent years, researcher Monique Morris has been trying to make sure girls-especially black girls-are included in conversations about racial disparities in education and the criminal justice system. Black girls make up just over a third of girls in juvenile detention, according to her 2012 paper titled \"Race, Gender and the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\" She reports that \"among the nation's 10 highest suspending districts, Black girls with one or more disability experienced the highest suspension rate of all girls.\" Disproportionate discipline in and removal from classrooms often means an increased chance of contact with police, the courts and jail. Black girls are often seen as threatening or disruptive in the classroom just as their male counterparts are, but for different reasons. Teachers and administrators clash with and discipline girls they perceive to be loud, defiant and unladylike, according to Morris. \"When Black girls do engage in acts that are deemed 'ghetto' or a deviation from the social norms that define female behavior according to a narrow, White middle-class definition of femininity, they are deemed nonconformative and thereby subject to criminalizing responses,\" Morris writes.

In the past thirty years, women have entered US prisons at nearly double the rate of men, with the female population behind bars growing by more than 800 percent, according to the Center for American Progress (CAP). Racial disparities exist for the female prisoner population, too. Black women are three times more likely than white women to be incarcerated and Latina women are nearly 70 percent more likely. The president's initiative promises to create economic opportunities for boys and young men, and girls and young women could use a hand in this arena as well. A study of black unemployment found that black teenage boys and girls experienced similar rates of joblessness during 2011-a low of 35 percent for black girls and 39 percent for black boys and a high of 48 percent for both. The same UC Berkeley Labor Center study found that between 2009 and 2011, the unemployment rate declined slightly for black men but joblessness actually increased for black women. Unemployment rates fell for both white men and white women during this time. Fewer opportunities for work spells trouble for the segment of the population that's long struggled to build assets. Just look at median household wealth broken down by race and gender. According to CAP, single black and Latina women have $100 and $120 respectively in median household wealth, compared to single black men at $7,900, single white women at $41,500, and single white men at $43,800. Add children to the mix and the median wealth of black and Latina single mothers drops to $0. By outlining challenges facing black and Latina girls and women, I don't intend to play into some kind of intraracial oppression Olympics, in which we pretend that boys and men aren't suffering or argue that this public-private partnership should do nothing for anyone if it can't do something for everyone. But these statistics should raise questions about the case made in the 2006 Times article. At the time, experts argued that poor black women had already gotten a hand up through welfare reform, the new enforcement of child support obligations and a booming economy in the '90s. Girls' and women's ongoing uphill battles against poverty and criminalization should also make us question why, as the African American Policy Forum reports, the philanthropic world has invested $100 million in initiatives targeting black and Latino boys over the last decade but less than $1 million targeting girls and women in those same racial and ethnic groups. These are some of the issues that need to be addressed as $200 million more foundation dollars and the force of the White House get involved. Reinvigorating the conversation offers a new opportunity to be explicit about where girls and women fit. And if the answer is-as it seems to be-that we don't, it's time to start talking about why. Editor's Note: This piece originally claimed that intimate partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women ages 15-35. In fact, this widely-reported claim is incorrect. The text has been updated to reflect correct statistics about black women, homicide, and intimate partner violence.\n\nNow that the concept has moved from the non-profit world to presidential policy, it's impossible to keep ignoring the obvious question: where do girls and young women fit in? If streets corners, classrooms, workplaces and court systems are inhospitable to and dangerous for black and Latino boys and men, how do they affect the girls and women who are often right by their sides? After all, boys and men don't exist in a vacuum. In fact, black and Latina girls and women also struggle to succeed in school, avoid the criminal justice system, and find and keep good jobs. Nearly 40 percent of black and Latina girls fail to graduate high school on time. Black girls experience sexual violence at rates higher than their white and Latina counterparts, and black women are murdered by men at more than two and a half times the rate of white women . Of those black women killed by men in 2011, nearly half were intimate partners of the offenders. This is perhaps not the kind of violence Obama's initiative is drawing attention to, but it's violence just the same. In recent years, researcher Monique Morris has been trying to make sure girls-especially black girls-are included in conversations about racial disparities in education and the criminal justice system. Black girls make up just over a third of girls in juvenile detention, according to her 2012 paper titled \"Race, Gender and the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\" She reports that \"among the nation's 10 highest suspending districts, Black girls with one or more disability experienced the highest suspension rate of all girls.\" Disproportionate discipline in and removal from classrooms often means an increased chance of contact with police, the courts and jail. Black girls are often seen as threatening or disruptive in the classroom just as their male counterparts are, but for different reasons. Teachers and administrators clash with and discipline girls they perceive to be loud, defiant and unladylike, according to Morris. \"When Black girls do engage in acts that are deemed 'ghetto' or a deviation from the social norms that define female behavior according to a narrow, White middle-class definition of femininity, they are deemed nonconformative and thereby subject to criminalizing responses,\" Morris writes.

These are some of the issues that need to be addressed as $200 million more foundation dollars and the force of the White House get involved. Reinvigorating the conversation offers a new opportunity to be explicit about where girls and women fit. And if the answer is-as it seems to be-that we don't, it's time to start talking about why. Editor's Note: This piece originally claimed that intimate partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women ages 15-35. In fact, this widely-reported claim is incorrect. The text has been updated to reflect correct statistics about black women, homicide, and intimate partner violence.\n\nBy outlining challenges facing black and Latina girls and women, I don't intend to play into some kind of intraracial oppression Olympics, in which we pretend that boys and men aren't suffering or argue that this public-private partnership should do nothing for anyone if it can't do something for everyone. But these statistics should raise questions about the case made in the 2006 Times article.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Larry never realized that the problem was in fact his own inability to switch on the satellite. His friend Wanda Sykes figured it out in three seconds and said , \"You gotta turn the damn satellite on for the TV to work! See the little green light? Just gotta turn it on! Or you can fire the black man. Whatever works for you.\" It boggles the mind that this Richie Incognito/Jonathan Martin bullying saga, a story about an n-bomb dropping abuser, a complicit coaching staff and the ways \"sausages are made\" in the National Football League, has for many commentators come back to \"blaming the black man.\" The fault, in this narrative, is not with the toxic nature of the Dolphins locker room or a coaching staff abiding a racist culture in order to \"toughen up\" players, but with an apolitical generation of young black men who have no problem with white people dropping n-bombs like Vanilla Sherbet in Fear of a Black Hat. So many commentators have taken these comments and gone on the generalization express train, which always seems to stop at the \"blame young black men station.\" In this line of commentary, young black men don't know about civil rights and have no conception of what their elders went through. If only they weren't so ignorant, this Richie Incognito situation would never have happened. Jason Whitlock, in a column that actually has a great deal to offer , writes that their acceptance of Richie Incognito as \"honorary\" is the fruits of our \"incarceration nation\" and a \"prison yard\" locker room that valorizes a certain kind of black masculinity-more represented by Incognito than the Stanford grad Martin-and has turned every young black man into wanting to be Adebisi from Oz , or risk being a \"punk\". This all sounds convincing, but only if you are predisposed to see NFL players already as a collection of thugs. Does the violence of the NFL or the violence of the neighborhoods of their youth spill over into player's lives? Absolutely. But the idea that the NFL locker room is a \"prison yard\" where players are \"predators\" and white players drop n-bombs while black players laugh it up is not supported by facts. (This stereotype also slanders many of the more than 2 million people who live behind bars and are trying to hold onto their humanity in a deeply dehumanizing environment.) The most important thing that anyone in the media can do with this story is to try and untangle what is part of \"NFL locker room culture\" and what is unique to the Miami Dolphins locker room. Based on my reporting and all the reporting I've read from others it is clear that, yes, this type of bullying is far too common in the NFL. Yes, the kinds of so-called jokes about sexual assault and homophobia are also very common, although the homophobia, reflecting our culture, is getting better. But also every person I've talked to have said that \"no way no how\" do white players walk around the locker room dropping n-bombs in a friendly way as if they are just one of \"the boyz.\" As Ted Johnson former New England Patriots said to me, \"The only time I ever heard white people saying it was if they were being racist and were actually looking for a fight.\" As much as I respect actor and former NFL player Terry Crews and his comments about the NFL -they called him Tyrone!-the league is not, as he said, \"jail with money.\" It takes an insane amount of focus, dedication and hard work to make it to the National Football League. Talking about players like they are thugs only reinforces both racial profiling and racism. It also valorizes is the very qualities that Richie Incognito seemed proud to represent: the bullying violence and disregard for others. And as for this specific Miami Dolphins locker room, it sounds both like many other locker rooms but also unique in its toxicity. But as in every single locker room, it is a place like in every NFL locker room where the life of a player is incredibly precarious. There is no way that Richie incognito gets away with dropping n-bombs without approval from the coaching staff. Many are saying that they wish more players had been more confident to stand up to the 320-pound Richie Incognito. But those saying that should also take a step back and realize that is exactly what Jonathan Martin just did.

Greg Mitchell on Richard Cohen's controversial gaffe about multi-racial marriage and de Blasio's family .\n\nAs much as I respect actor and former NFL player Terry Crews and his comments about the NFL -they called him Tyrone!-the league is not, as he said, \"jail with money.\" It takes an insane amount of focus, dedication and hard work to make it to the National Football League. Talking about players like they are thugs only reinforces both racial profiling and racism. It also valorizes is the very qualities that Richie Incognito seemed proud to represent: the bullying violence and disregard for others. And as for this specific Miami Dolphins locker room, it sounds both like many other locker rooms but also unique in its toxicity. But as in every single locker room, it is a place like in every NFL locker room where the life of a player is incredibly precarious. There is no way that Richie incognito gets away with dropping n-bombs without approval from the coaching staff.

Last week, however, it became more than a figurative admonition when Lolade Siyanbola, a black graduate student at Yale University, was reported to campus police by a white female student for the suspicious action of napping in a dormitory common room. Like generations of hard-grinding Ivy League scholars, Siyanbola had succumbed to the exhaustion of finals week. But her inability to stay awake-a literal failure to stay woke-resulted in a 20-minute encounter with police officers who insisted she verify her right to be on campus. I first learned about the Yale incident when Prof. Sherri Williams of American University shared the news with the Black on Campus GroupMe chat. The GroupMe is one of the key tools that Dr. Williams and I use to communicate with a cohort of 10 student journalists. The Black on Campus fellows attend colleges and graduate schools throughout the country. Since January they have been meeting, studying, traveling, and writing together in a program jointly sponsored by the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University and The Nation as they document the lived experiences of today's black college students. This story was produced in partnership with the Anna Julia Cooper Center of Wake Forest University as part of Black on Campus, a series reporting on issues of national consequence to a black college student audience. It is under the umbrella of Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words. For more Student Nation, check out our archive .  The Student Nation program is made possible through generous funding from The Puffin Foundation . The Black on Campus cohort barely reacted when Dr. Williams shared word of the Yale incident. They may have been outraged, but racial shock is exceedingly rare among these young reporters. After all, their academic year began with white supremacists wielding flaming tiki torches as they marched through the grounds of the University of Virginia chanting \"You will not replace us.\" On a near weekly basis, we've shared stories of campuses inflamed by symbolic racism , discursive violence , or bodily harm against black students in predominantly white spaces. We reeled when Howard University was caught in a funding scandal , suggesting that even the nation's premier historically black university was a place where students experienced intentional institutional harm. For Black on Campus fellows, these stories were not distant or disconnected. Fellow Lauren Lumpkin and Dr. Williams study and work at American University, where bananas and nooses were found hanging in trees one year ago. The wounds of white-supremacist violence are still fresh at the University of Virginia, where fellow Alexis Gravely is a junior. Wake Forest fellow Bri Reddick was trying to study for midterms when she found herself at the center of a campus racial controversy making national headlines.

Campus Awakening Today's black college students have spent their baccalaureate years navigating campus hate speech, dodging constantly changing DACA rulings, and living with the real consequences of repealing affirmative action and Title IX enforcement. The new class of college seniors started school in the fall of 2015. That semester, graduate student Jonathan Butler stopped eating to protest inaction and ineffective administrative responses to racial incidents at the University of Missouri. He refused to resume eating until the system's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned. Four days into his hunger strike, Butler was joined by 30 Missouri football players who announced they would boycott football activities until Wolfe resigned. Within weeks both the campus chancellor and Wolfe were gone, and the effects of the Mizzou protests were still being felt for years after they began. In 2017, The New York Times reported on plummeting enrollment and a budgetary crisis at the University of Missouri as students remained wary of a campus where racial clashes had reached such a fever pitch. It is impossible to determine the precise nature of the correlation-whether the protests effected these new campus realities-but there is no question that the events at Mizzou continue to resonate across the landscape of American higher education. Mizzou was a turning point. Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B. Wells-righting wrongs by shining the light of truth upon them.

Campus Awakening Today's black college students have spent their baccalaureate years navigating campus hate speech, dodging constantly changing DACA rulings, and living with the real consequences of repealing affirmative action and Title IX enforcement. The new class of college seniors started school in the fall of 2015. That semester, graduate student Jonathan Butler stopped eating to protest inaction and ineffective administrative responses to racial incidents at the University of Missouri. He refused to resume eating until the system's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned. Four days into his hunger strike, Butler was joined by 30 Missouri football players who announced they would boycott football activities until Wolfe resigned. Within weeks both the campus chancellor and Wolfe were gone, and the effects of the Mizzou protests were still being felt for years after they began. In 2017, The New York Times reported on plummeting enrollment and a budgetary crisis at the University of Missouri as students remained wary of a campus where racial clashes had reached such a fever pitch. It is impossible to determine the precise nature of the correlation-whether the protests effected these new campus realities-but there is no question that the events at Mizzou continue to resonate across the landscape of American higher education. Mizzou was a turning point. Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B. Wells-righting wrongs by shining the light of truth upon them.

The new class of college seniors started school in the fall of 2015. That semester, graduate student Jonathan Butler stopped eating to protest inaction and ineffective administrative responses to racial incidents at the University of Missouri. He refused to resume eating until the system's president, Tim Wolfe, resigned. Four days into his hunger strike, Butler was joined by 30 Missouri football players who announced they would boycott football activities until Wolfe resigned. Within weeks both the campus chancellor and Wolfe were gone, and the effects of the Mizzou protests were still being felt for years after they began. In 2017, The New York Times reported on plummeting enrollment and a budgetary crisis at the University of Missouri as students remained wary of a campus where racial clashes had reached such a fever pitch. It is impossible to determine the precise nature of the correlation-whether the protests effected these new campus realities-but there is no question that the events at Mizzou continue to resonate across the landscape of American higher education. Mizzou was a turning point. Within weeks, black students organized massive demonstrations on Ivy League campuses and flagship state universities. Activists decried the racial climate on campuses in the South, Northeast, Midwest, and California. They demanded change at schools small and large, on campuses with conservative or liberal reputations. Echoing tactics employed by student demonstrators in the 1960s and '70s, they held vigils and rallies and staged takeovers of administrative offices, articulating systemic, symbolic, and structural concerns about their experiences of being black on campus. Yale students resisted faculty who declared racially insensitive Halloween costumes to be protected speech. Princeton students demanded the removal of Woodrow Wilson's name from campus buildings in light of his troubling racial legacy. Harvard Law students discovered photos of black faculty members that had been defaced in the halls. Suddenly these experiences no longer seemed isolated, but were linked as part of a larger movement against institutional racism in higher education. Current Issue View our current issue Many stood in solidarity with the student protesters, but others were exasperated by their actions and in some cases implied that personal discomfort, or even interpersonal experiences of racism, were a steep but necessary price to pay for a college education . Even within black communities, there were intergenerational divides born from the painful disappointments of seeing college-long a kind of symbolic promised land-decried as yet another space of racial violence and rejection. It can seem inherently revolutionary to nurture black intellect in a country built on the surplus value extracted from nonconsensual physical and reproductive black labor. Viewing higher education as a pathway to equity, African-American families and communities have made enormous sacrifices to send black kids to college. It was painful to see that golden ring turn to brass. Substance of Things Hoped For In March 1960, Ebony magazine profiled \"Richmond's Genius Twins\" in a multipage spread about William and Wesley Harris, who were poised to graduate from segregated Armstrong High School and become the first in their family to attend college. Ebony described Wes and William as \"sons of a restaurant owner who died in 1955 and a Richmond seamstress who is a chronic arthritic and earns $35 a week doing home sewing and making slipcovers.\" Knowing her sons' departure for college would significantly reduce her household's already meager income, Rosa Harris told Ebony she was nonetheless determined that \"the boys will go to college!\" in spite of the difficult sacrifices it required. Black parents, grandmas, papas, aunties, congregations, Masonic lodges, sorority chapters, and fraternal orders have echoed the determination to ensure that the children in their communities make it to college to earn a coveted degree. A college education has always been a rare commodity. Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B.

Prior to World War II, only a small fraction of white people attended college. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that the GI Bill and a changing domestic labor market made college a more common experience for white Americans. In 1960, only 10 percent of white men older than 25 had completed four years of college; by 1990, that share had grown to nearly one in four white men. Today, more than a third of white Americans over 25 have college degrees. For black folks, the barriers to college have been far higher and more aggressively guarded. In 1960, 2.8 percent of black men and 3.3 percent of black women over 25 had completed four-year college degrees. Today, one in five black Americans is a college graduate. For much of the 20th century, the vast majority of black students obtained degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. HBCUs have proud legacies but have never boasted the robust resources of their predominantly white peers. It is worth remembering that George Wallace did not stand in the doorway of a primary school or high school. Rather, in 1963, he blocked the entrance to a state land-grant university as he sought to keep Vivian Malone and James Hood from entering the University of Alabama-thus ensuring, Wallace hoped, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Is it any wonder, then, that black folk have developed a tradition of boisterous, thunderous, celebratory enthusiasm during college graduations? Each and every graduate marching, striding, shouting, and hopping across the stage as they accept the parchment so rarely passed into black hands is a repudiation of Governor Wallace. And is it any wonder why black people were appalled to witness the white graduation marshals at the University of Florida aggressively push, pull, and nearly tackle black graduates as they attempted to dance their way across the commencement stage this month? In a way, those marshals were reimposing the segregationist barrier; they saw neither the depth of the sacrifices that made these graduations possible nor the historical context in which they were achieved. No Evidence for the Things We Hoped to See The racial inequities in American higher-education outcomes are shocking. During the past 50 years, the gap between black and white high-school graduation rates has narrowed, but the racial gulf for attaining a bachelor's degree has widened-doubling from 6 to 13 percent since 1964. Higher education is not a great equalizer. The struggle, sacrifice, and effort it takes for black students to earn a degree often pays meager long-term economic dividends, while extracting enormous emotional costs. The median wealth return for college graduation for white families is $55,869, while black families enjoy a median return on college graduation of only $4,846. This results from the crushing debt carried by black graduates. Compared to their white peers, black students are more likely to borrow to pay for college, less likely make repayment progress within 12 years, and much more likely to default. Employment prospects improve for African Americans when they graduate from college, but a degree does not eliminate the racial inequities of the labor market. Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus. For the next several months The Nation will bring you reporting from the talented young writers of the Black on Campus cohort as they follow in the example of Ida B.

Compared to their white counterparts, black college graduates in their late 20s are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed. Even amid the economic recovery of 2016, black college graduates aged 24-29 experienced an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent -a rate higher than the 9 percent unemployment rate that young white college grads suffered at the peak of the recession. Colleges and universities are not ivory towers tucked away from the real world or able to avoid controversy at will. These institutions are embedded in our communities and in our consciousness. To be black on campus is to be black in America. But despite these depressing statistics, there is still something powerfully compelling about being black on campus. When global superstar Beyoncé chose to frame her earth-shattering 2018 Coachella performance with one aspect of black cultural life, she chose black college life. Though she did not attend college, Beyoncé offered up a citational riff on collegiate blackness, from HBCU drum majors and drum lines to black sororities and pledge lines. Despite its all too frequently amounting to four painful years, Beyoncé celebrated the experience of being black on campus. The Legacy William and Wes Harris, Ebony 's \" genius twins,\" both became college graduates. In fact, both became college professors. William finished at Howard University, earned a PhD at the University of Washington, then returned to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he taught for more than 20 years and served as the first dean of African-American affairs. Wes made history as the first black man to earn an engineering PhD from Princeton and later chaired the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at MIT. His historic accomplishments began at UVA, where he was the first African-American student to live on the Lawn. Sending the twins to college required their mother to make enduring sacrifices, but Prof. Wes Harris remembers his experiences at UVA in the early 1960s being marked by racial exclusion, threats, and violence . Dr. Harris's story is not entirely dissimilar from the one recounted by Lauren Lumpkin, the Black on Campus fellow, last week when she served as the American University School of Communication undergraduate student speaker. Lauren's brief but affecting address began by acknowledging the parents and teachers whose efforts made her own success possible. She spoke of her teenage longing to attend American University and then of her broken heart when the campus was marred by ugly racial incidents. Lauren explained it was her awakening to the need for diverse voices telling diverse stories in the wake of these experiences that led her to the School of Communication and to her chosen career as a journalist. More than five decades separate the college careers of Wesley Harris and Lauren Lumpkin. Still, they are intertwined. Wes and William Harris are my uncle and father. Lauren is one of my students. Their stories matter. We must understand what it has meant, historically, and assess what it means now, to be black on campus.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Some were accompanied by parents, mostly their mothers. Some wore red button-up shirts and black ties that marked them as members of the Striving Black Brothers Coalition, a group that provides mentorship to young African-American men attending a nearby community college. One wore a letterman-style jacket issued by another college-prep program geared toward black youth. Embroidered on the back was a question: What if the prince dared to be king? The princes in question had been convened by the College Bound Brotherhood, an organization that connects black boys and young men in the Bay Area to scholarships and peer support. They spent the day hearing from a former college-football star as well as admissions officers from the University of California-all men of color. Meanwhile, their parents attended sessions on financial aid and traded tips on dorm move-ins and care packages. The young men learned how much time to spend on homework (two hours for every one spent in class), the best place to sit in a classroom (never farther back than the third row), and how many community-college credits are required before a student is eligible to transfer to the UC system (sixty). Monique Johnson, whose 17-year-old son recently graduated from nearby San Rafael High School and will be attending the California Maritime Academy, considered all of this a godsend. \"Where else are you going to have a room full of African-American men of this age who are not in trouble, who are doing the right thing?\" she asked me. \"And their parents are here,\" she added, \"so this debunks every myth that you've heard.\" * * * Debunking \"every myth that you've heard\" about black and Latino boys and young men is a goal of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper (MBK) initiative, which seeks to close the \"opportunity gaps\" faced by boys and young men of color. Not since Bill Clinton tried-and failed-to launch an initiative on race during his second term has a president called attention to the persistent racial disparities in health, wealth, education, incarceration and more. This time around, the effort involves more than holding town halls and issuing reports: My Brother's Keeper has partnered with foundations, which will allocate $200 million for the initiative, as well as corporations like AT&T, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, which have pledged $100 million in additional financial support. Many racial-justice advocates have welcomed President Obama's attention, and the funding that comes with it. But since it was launched in February, My Brother's Keeper has met with a firestorm of criticism in opinion pieces, on cable news shows and in two highly publicized open letters. On Twitter, opponents have adopted the hashtag #WhyWeCantWait-referring to the 1964 book by Martin Luther King Jr. that grew out of his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail\"-as their rallying cry. The crux of these critics' argument: if the Obama administration's sole racial-justice initiative focuses exclusively on boys and men, then girls and women of color-who are part of the same disadvantaged families, classrooms and communities-find themselves ignored.

It organized the two open letters-one signed by more than 200 black men, and the other by more than 1,000 women of color-and hosted public conference calls. On one such call in early July, Kristie Dotson, a signer and philosophy professor at Michigan State University, put the question succinctly: \"Are black girls genuinely part of the black community?\" At the heart of My Brother's Keeper is a questionable assumption: that the key to developing stronger families and communities is to create more successful (and thus more marriageable) young men. MBK's proponents argue that boys and young men of color lag uniquely far behind their white and female counterparts, but they fail to explain how improving the boys' success will address the myriad challenges faced by black and Latina girls and young women. For example, black girls and women age 10 to 24 are murdered at rates higher than any other group of girls or women. Black girls are three times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school. The median wealth of single black mothers is $100 and $120 for Latina single mothers; it's $45,400 for white single moms. Also, black and Latino students-girls and boys alike-have made almost no progress in twelfth-grade reading scores in the past two decades and still trail behind white students. Supporters of My Brother's Keeper counter that this administration does have an initiative aimed at females: the White House Council on Women and Girls. But the council's chief purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for research on this demographic. It lacks the private funding that gives MBK the potential to make an impact. It also lacks a focus on communities of color. Indeed, very little foundation funding is directed to communities of color in the first place. According to a 2013 Foundation Center report, organizations serving people of color receive only 9 percent of grant allocations. Nor is My Brother's Keeper the only instance in which boys and men have been made the focus of funding efforts to the exclusion of girls. It builds on a coordinated philanthropic focus that began in the 1990s and was ramped up in 2006, after The New York Times published a front-page article highlighting research on the unique challenges facing black men. Organizations and individuals receiving grants from the foundations now central to My Brother's Keeper argue that while the social and economic indicators for girls and young women of color may be bleak, boys and men in these communities can't afford to wait either. In the pro-MBK camp's opinion, attempting to hold up an initiative that's already under way is a risky proposition-especially when the nation's first black president is championing it. Marc Philpart, associate director of PolicyLink and director of PolicyLink's Boys and Men of Color Team, argues that the criticism of MBK could have real consequences. \"It might become a political hot potato, and nobody picks it up after the president,\" says Philpart, who also works with a statewide boys and men of color network convened by the California Endowment, another foundation providing financial backing to MBK. \"Critics have been overly harsh and created an air of negativity that helps neither their cause or My Brother's Keeper. It's a nascent movement. In situations like that, the goal should be to bring people into the fold and not push them away.\" * * * Alicia Dixon is executive director of the Marcus Foster Education Fund, one of three organizations that run the College Bound Brotherhood. (Another is the Kapor Center for Social Impact, one of the eleven foundations central to MBK.) Dixon is also an African-American single mother of three boys. She says she understands the perspective of those who have signed the AAPF's letters, but she's firm in her belief that the data comparing men and boys to women and girls prove that young black men are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment. Young black men complete college at rates lower than any other racial or ethnic group, regardless of sex, according to a 2012 study. Whereas 68.5 and 65.9 percent of black women are awarded associate's and bachelor's degrees, respectively, only about a third of black men achieve either. \"I get all of that debate,\" Dixon tells me. \"I just think it's important that we not get distracted.\" These disparities help explain why foundations made education their top funding priority for black boys and men between 2008 and 2010, according to a 2012 Foundation Center report. In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects. According to the proponents of such initiatives, programs tailored to meet the specific needs of African-American males will create a ripple effect that reaches other groups. As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality. He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people. The suit he wears can put up a barrier, he said, and he strives to be approachable. * * * The Brown Boi Project is not the typical grantee receiving funds for programs intended for boys and young men. The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

They spent the day hearing from a former college-football star as well as admissions officers from the University of California-all men of color. Meanwhile, their parents attended sessions on financial aid and traded tips on dorm move-ins and care packages. The young men learned how much time to spend on homework (two hours for every one spent in class), the best place to sit in a classroom (never farther back than the third row), and how many community-college credits are required before a student is eligible to transfer to the UC system (sixty). Monique Johnson, whose 17-year-old son recently graduated from nearby San Rafael High School and will be attending the California Maritime Academy, considered all of this a godsend. \"Where else are you going to have a room full of African-American men of this age who are not in trouble, who are doing the right thing?\" she asked me. \"And their parents are here,\" she added, \"so this debunks every myth that you've heard.\" * * * Debunking \"every myth that you've heard\" about black and Latino boys and young men is a goal of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper (MBK) initiative, which seeks to close the \"opportunity gaps\" faced by boys and young men of color. Not since Bill Clinton tried-and failed-to launch an initiative on race during his second term has a president called attention to the persistent racial disparities in health, wealth, education, incarceration and more. This time around, the effort involves more than holding town halls and issuing reports: My Brother's Keeper has partnered with foundations, which will allocate $200 million for the initiative, as well as corporations like AT&T, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, which have pledged $100 million in additional financial support. Many racial-justice advocates have welcomed President Obama's attention, and the funding that comes with it. But since it was launched in February, My Brother's Keeper has met with a firestorm of criticism in opinion pieces, on cable news shows and in two highly publicized open letters. On Twitter, opponents have adopted the hashtag #WhyWeCantWait-referring to the 1964 book by Martin Luther King Jr. that grew out of his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail\"-as their rallying cry. The crux of these critics' argument: if the Obama administration's sole racial-justice initiative focuses exclusively on boys and men, then girls and women of color-who are part of the same disadvantaged families, classrooms and communities-find themselves ignored.

It organized the two open letters-one signed by more than 200 black men, and the other by more than 1,000 women of color-and hosted public conference calls. On one such call in early July, Kristie Dotson, a signer and philosophy professor at Michigan State University, put the question succinctly: \"Are black girls genuinely part of the black community?\" At the heart of My Brother's Keeper is a questionable assumption: that the key to developing stronger families and communities is to create more successful (and thus more marriageable) young men. MBK's proponents argue that boys and young men of color lag uniquely far behind their white and female counterparts, but they fail to explain how improving the boys' success will address the myriad challenges faced by black and Latina girls and young women. For example, black girls and women age 10 to 24 are murdered at rates higher than any other group of girls or women. Black girls are three times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school. The median wealth of single black mothers is $100 and $120 for Latina single mothers; it's $45,400 for white single moms. Also, black and Latino students-girls and boys alike-have made almost no progress in twelfth-grade reading scores in the past two decades and still trail behind white students. Supporters of My Brother's Keeper counter that this administration does have an initiative aimed at females: the White House Council on Women and Girls. But the council's chief purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for research on this demographic. It lacks the private funding that gives MBK the potential to make an impact. It also lacks a focus on communities of color. Indeed, very little foundation funding is directed to communities of color in the first place. According to a 2013 Foundation Center report, organizations serving people of color receive only 9 percent of grant allocations. Nor is My Brother's Keeper the only instance in which boys and men have been made the focus of funding efforts to the exclusion of girls.

As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality. He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people. The suit he wears can put up a barrier, he said, and he strives to be approachable. * * * The Brown Boi Project is not the typical grantee receiving funds for programs intended for boys and young men. The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

Not since Bill Clinton tried-and failed-to launch an initiative on race during his second term has a president called attention to the persistent racial disparities in health, wealth, education, incarceration and more. This time around, the effort involves more than holding town halls and issuing reports: My Brother's Keeper has partnered with foundations, which will allocate $200 million for the initiative, as well as corporations like AT&T, UBS and JPMorgan Chase, which have pledged $100 million in additional financial support. Many racial-justice advocates have welcomed President Obama's attention, and the funding that comes with it. But since it was launched in February, My Brother's Keeper has met with a firestorm of criticism in opinion pieces, on cable news shows and in two highly publicized open letters. On Twitter, opponents have adopted the hashtag #WhyWeCantWait-referring to the 1964 book by Martin Luther King Jr. that grew out of his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail\"-as their rallying cry. The crux of these critics' argument: if the Obama administration's sole racial-justice initiative focuses exclusively on boys and men, then girls and women of color-who are part of the same disadvantaged families, classrooms and communities-find themselves ignored.

It organized the two open letters-one signed by more than 200 black men, and the other by more than 1,000 women of color-and hosted public conference calls. On one such call in early July, Kristie Dotson, a signer and philosophy professor at Michigan State University, put the question succinctly: \"Are black girls genuinely part of the black community?\" At the heart of My Brother's Keeper is a questionable assumption: that the key to developing stronger families and communities is to create more successful (and thus more marriageable) young men. MBK's proponents argue that boys and young men of color lag uniquely far behind their white and female counterparts, but they fail to explain how improving the boys' success will address the myriad challenges faced by black and Latina girls and young women. For example, black girls and women age 10 to 24 are murdered at rates higher than any other group of girls or women. Black girls are three times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school. The median wealth of single black mothers is $100 and $120 for Latina single mothers; it's $45,400 for white single moms. Also, black and Latino students-girls and boys alike-have made almost no progress in twelfth-grade reading scores in the past two decades and still trail behind white students. Supporters of My Brother's Keeper counter that this administration does have an initiative aimed at females: the White House Council on Women and Girls. But the council's chief purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for research on this demographic. It lacks the private funding that gives MBK the potential to make an impact. It also lacks a focus on communities of color. Indeed, very little foundation funding is directed to communities of color in the first place. According to a 2013 Foundation Center report, organizations serving people of color receive only 9 percent of grant allocations. Nor is My Brother's Keeper the only instance in which boys and men have been made the focus of funding efforts to the exclusion of girls. It builds on a coordinated philanthropic focus that began in the 1990s and was ramped up in 2006, after The New York Times published a front-page article highlighting research on the unique challenges facing black men. Organizations and individuals receiving grants from the foundations now central to My Brother's Keeper argue that while the social and economic indicators for girls and young women of color may be bleak, boys and men in these communities can't afford to wait either. In the pro-MBK camp's opinion, attempting to hold up an initiative that's already under way is a risky proposition-especially when the nation's first black president is championing it. Marc Philpart, associate director of PolicyLink and director of PolicyLink's Boys and Men of Color Team, argues that the criticism of MBK could have real consequences. \"It might become a political hot potato, and nobody picks it up after the president,\" says Philpart, who also works with a statewide boys and men of color network convened by the California Endowment, another foundation providing financial backing to MBK. \"Critics have been overly harsh and created an air of negativity that helps neither their cause or My Brother's Keeper. It's a nascent movement. In situations like that, the goal should be to bring people into the fold and not push them away.\" * * * Alicia Dixon is executive director of the Marcus Foster Education Fund, one of three organizations that run the College Bound Brotherhood. (Another is the Kapor Center for Social Impact, one of the eleven foundations central to MBK.) Dixon is also an African-American single mother of three boys. She says she understands the perspective of those who have signed the AAPF's letters, but she's firm in her belief that the data comparing men and boys to women and girls prove that young black men are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment. Young black men complete college at rates lower than any other racial or ethnic group, regardless of sex, according to a 2012 study. Whereas 68.5 and 65.9 percent of black women are awarded associate's and bachelor's degrees, respectively, only about a third of black men achieve either. \"I get all of that debate,\" Dixon tells me. \"I just think it's important that we not get distracted.\" These disparities help explain why foundations made education their top funding priority for black boys and men between 2008 and 2010, according to a 2012 Foundation Center report. In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects.

The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people. The suit he wears can put up a barrier, he said, and he strives to be approachable. * * * The Brown Boi Project is not the typical grantee receiving funds for programs intended for boys and young men. The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

But since it was launched in February, My Brother's Keeper has met with a firestorm of criticism in opinion pieces, on cable news shows and in two highly publicized open letters. On Twitter, opponents have adopted the hashtag #WhyWeCantWait-referring to the 1964 book by Martin Luther King Jr. that grew out of his \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail\"-as their rallying cry. The crux of these critics' argument: if the Obama administration's sole racial-justice initiative focuses exclusively on boys and men, then girls and women of color-who are part of the same disadvantaged families, classrooms and communities-find themselves ignored.

It organized the two open letters-one signed by more than 200 black men, and the other by more than 1,000 women of color-and hosted public conference calls. On one such call in early July, Kristie Dotson, a signer and philosophy professor at Michigan State University, put the question succinctly: \"Are black girls genuinely part of the black community?\" At the heart of My Brother's Keeper is a questionable assumption: that the key to developing stronger families and communities is to create more successful (and thus more marriageable) young men. MBK's proponents argue that boys and young men of color lag uniquely far behind their white and female counterparts, but they fail to explain how improving the boys' success will address the myriad challenges faced by black and Latina girls and young women. For example, black girls and women age 10 to 24 are murdered at rates higher than any other group of girls or women. Black girls are three times more likely than white girls to be suspended from school. The median wealth of single black mothers is $100 and $120 for Latina single mothers; it's $45,400 for white single moms. Also, black and Latino students-girls and boys alike-have made almost no progress in twelfth-grade reading scores in the past two decades and still trail behind white students. Supporters of My Brother's Keeper counter that this administration does have an initiative aimed at females: the White House Council on Women and Girls. But the council's chief purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for research on this demographic. It lacks the private funding that gives MBK the potential to make an impact. It also lacks a focus on communities of color. Indeed, very little foundation funding is directed to communities of color in the first place. According to a 2013 Foundation Center report, organizations serving people of color receive only 9 percent of grant allocations. Nor is My Brother's Keeper the only instance in which boys and men have been made the focus of funding efforts to the exclusion of girls. It builds on a coordinated philanthropic focus that began in the 1990s and was ramped up in 2006, after The New York Times published a front-page article highlighting research on the unique challenges facing black men. Organizations and individuals receiving grants from the foundations now central to My Brother's Keeper argue that while the social and economic indicators for girls and young women of color may be bleak, boys and men in these communities can't afford to wait either. In the pro-MBK camp's opinion, attempting to hold up an initiative that's already under way is a risky proposition-especially when the nation's first black president is championing it. Marc Philpart, associate director of PolicyLink and director of PolicyLink's Boys and Men of Color Team, argues that the criticism of MBK could have real consequences. \"It might become a political hot potato, and nobody picks it up after the president,\" says Philpart, who also works with a statewide boys and men of color network convened by the California Endowment, another foundation providing financial backing to MBK. \"Critics have been overly harsh and created an air of negativity that helps neither their cause or My Brother's Keeper. It's a nascent movement. In situations like that, the goal should be to bring people into the fold and not push them away.\" * * * Alicia Dixon is executive director of the Marcus Foster Education Fund, one of three organizations that run the College Bound Brotherhood. (Another is the Kapor Center for Social Impact, one of the eleven foundations central to MBK.) Dixon is also an African-American single mother of three boys. She says she understands the perspective of those who have signed the AAPF's letters, but she's firm in her belief that the data comparing men and boys to women and girls prove that young black men are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment. Young black men complete college at rates lower than any other racial or ethnic group, regardless of sex, according to a 2012 study. Whereas 68.5 and 65.9 percent of black women are awarded associate's and bachelor's degrees, respectively, only about a third of black men achieve either. \"I get all of that debate,\" Dixon tells me. \"I just think it's important that we not get distracted.\" These disparities help explain why foundations made education their top funding priority for black boys and men between 2008 and 2010, according to a 2012 Foundation Center report. In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects. According to the proponents of such initiatives, programs tailored to meet the specific needs of African-American males will create a ripple effect that reaches other groups. As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality. He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK.

Organizations and individuals receiving grants from the foundations now central to My Brother's Keeper argue that while the social and economic indicators for girls and young women of color may be bleak, boys and men in these communities can't afford to wait either. In the pro-MBK camp's opinion, attempting to hold up an initiative that's already under way is a risky proposition-especially when the nation's first black president is championing it. Marc Philpart, associate director of PolicyLink and director of PolicyLink's Boys and Men of Color Team, argues that the criticism of MBK could have real consequences. \"It might become a political hot potato, and nobody picks it up after the president,\" says Philpart, who also works with a statewide boys and men of color network convened by the California Endowment, another foundation providing financial backing to MBK. \"Critics have been overly harsh and created an air of negativity that helps neither their cause or My Brother's Keeper. It's a nascent movement. In situations like that, the goal should be to bring people into the fold and not push them away.\" * * * Alicia Dixon is executive director of the Marcus Foster Education Fund, one of three organizations that run the College Bound Brotherhood. (Another is the Kapor Center for Social Impact, one of the eleven foundations central to MBK.) Dixon is also an African-American single mother of three boys. She says she understands the perspective of those who have signed the AAPF's letters, but she's firm in her belief that the data comparing men and boys to women and girls prove that young black men are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment. Young black men complete college at rates lower than any other racial or ethnic group, regardless of sex, according to a 2012 study. Whereas 68.5 and 65.9 percent of black women are awarded associate's and bachelor's degrees, respectively, only about a third of black men achieve either. \"I get all of that debate,\" Dixon tells me. \"I just think it's important that we not get distracted.\" These disparities help explain why foundations made education their top funding priority for black boys and men between 2008 and 2010, according to a 2012 Foundation Center report. In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects. According to the proponents of such initiatives, programs tailored to meet the specific needs of African-American males will create a ripple effect that reaches other groups. As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality. He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people. The suit he wears can put up a barrier, he said, and he strives to be approachable. * * * The Brown Boi Project is not the typical grantee receiving funds for programs intended for boys and young men. The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

But the council's chief purpose is to act as a clearinghouse for research on this demographic. It lacks the private funding that gives MBK the potential to make an impact. It also lacks a focus on communities of color. Indeed, very little foundation funding is directed to communities of color in the first place. According to a 2013 Foundation Center report, organizations serving people of color receive only 9 percent of grant allocations.

Marc Philpart, associate director of PolicyLink and director of PolicyLink's Boys and Men of Color Team, argues that the criticism of MBK could have real consequences. \"It might become a political hot potato, and nobody picks it up after the president,\" says Philpart, who also works with a statewide boys and men of color network convened by the California Endowment, another foundation providing financial backing to MBK. \"Critics have been overly harsh and created an air of negativity that helps neither their cause or My Brother's Keeper. It's a nascent movement. In situations like that, the goal should be to bring people into the fold and not push them away.\" * * * Alicia Dixon is executive director of the Marcus Foster Education Fund, one of three organizations that run the College Bound Brotherhood. (Another is the Kapor Center for Social Impact, one of the eleven foundations central to MBK.) Dixon is also an African-American single mother of three boys. She says she understands the perspective of those who have signed the AAPF's letters, but she's firm in her belief that the data comparing men and boys to women and girls prove that young black men are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to educational attainment. Young black men complete college at rates lower than any other racial or ethnic group, regardless of sex, according to a 2012 study. Whereas 68.5 and 65.9 percent of black women are awarded associate's and bachelor's degrees, respectively, only about a third of black men achieve either. \"I get all of that debate,\" Dixon tells me. \"I just think it's important that we not get distracted.\" These disparities help explain why foundations made education their top funding priority for black boys and men between 2008 and 2010, according to a 2012 Foundation Center report. In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects. According to the proponents of such initiatives, programs tailored to meet the specific needs of African-American males will create a ripple effect that reaches other groups. As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality. He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people. The suit he wears can put up a barrier, he said, and he strives to be approachable. * * * The Brown Boi Project is not the typical grantee receiving funds for programs intended for boys and young men. The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp.

The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem. Young people can relate to you when you're authentic, even if you're different.\" Brown Boi is introducing its boundary-pushing thinking to organizations that receive funding for boys and men of color. In meetings with funders and grantees, Brown Boi consistently calls attention to the absence of gay, bi and transgender men from the conversation, Woodland says. This past school year, the group ran a program that explored bullying, gender identity and racial justice for boys at a middle school in East Oakland. One recent recipient of a Black Male Achievement fellowship, Kalimah Priforce, tells me that Brown Boi expanded his perspective; he will now prioritize the inclusion of transmasculine people as he plans an upcoming tech hackathon. Joanne N. Smith, executive director of the Brooklyn-based youth development organization Girls for Gender Equity and another signer of the AAPF letter, agrees that gender-specific programming can work, but argues that it needs to happen alongside inclusive programs. \"We've found a way to do it collectively here,\" she says. \"We learned from early on that we have to work with the boys.\" Programs can be tailored for different groups of young people, she continues, but it's critical to \"then also come together to have those collective community conversations.\" When Smith was invited to a Washington, DC, convening of social-justice nonprofits tasked with drafting a statement of principles for an MBK report, recommendations she supported-such as addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth and boys who experience sexual assault-were left out. Instead, the report focused on six seemingly uncontroversial goals, such as getting more boys of color to read at the appropriate grade level. \"When we read the report, [our contribution] was totally missing,\" Smith says. She's adamant that the calls for a different approach will continue until there's a meaningful response from MBK leadership: \"There's no way we can allow this initiative to go on without a gender-inclusive lens.\" Read more from our special issue on racial justice Mychal Denzel Smith : \" How Trayvon Martin's Death Launched a New Generation of Black Activism \" The Editors : \" Renewing the Struggle for Racial Justice, Post-Ferguson \" Paula J.

In those two years, 40 percent of grant dollars that went to this demographic supported education-related projects. According to the proponents of such initiatives, programs tailored to meet the specific needs of African-American males will create a ripple effect that reaches other groups. As Dixon puts it: \"We think all boats will rise.\" Proponents of MBK say the success of programs developed now through grants to support boys and young men of color could lead to the development of future programs targeting other groups, like young Latina women or teenage African-American girls. But to do that, Philpart says, MBK needs to develop without a barrage of criticism from people within the black and social justice communities. When I ask him if he can understand why many women aren't content to wait for the ripples to reach them, he responds: \"I don't think anybody is asking women to wait. My Brother's Keeper is great. Let it be that, and women should have a separate initiative. By making My Brother's Keeper something else and broadening it, you lose the targeting that you want out of a situation like this.\" Sometimes the ripple effect is immediate, asserts Michèle Stephenson, a producer and director of the documentary American Promise , which aired on PBS earlier this year. By Stephenson's estimate, the Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement-another major player in MBK-gave $450,000 in grants and in-kind support for outreach campaigns for the film, which tells the story of how Stephenson's now-20-year-old son and his friend-who grow from black kindergartners to young men over the course of the movie-navigated New York City's tony and majority-white Dalton School. In the discussions after screenings, Stephenson says, she witnessed conversations relevant to black communities as a whole. When parents and educators discuss the film, \"talking about boys just becomes a platform to talk about the larger issues\"-such as educators' unconscious biases and the academic underperformance resulting from students' awareness of negative stereotypes-that affect both girls and boys. \"How do we expand this discussion,\" Stephenson asks, \"as opposed to promoting a critique that may not be constructive in the long run?\" * * * Alvin Starks is a longtime progressive racial-justice strategist who has worked with major funders of programs addressing racial inequality.

He was a program officer at the Open Society Foundations (OSF) in 2006, when The New York Times published a front-page story credited with inspiring the philanthropic focus that led to MBK. The article, headlined Plight Deepens for Black Men, Studies Warn, drew attention to the increase in incarceration rates throughout the 1990s and the persistent joblessness among black men. The piece marked a turning point for his colleagues, Starks said, but the approach seemed limited in scope to him even then. \"The conversation wasn't about unions, it wasn't about globalization, it wasn't about a changing economy,\" he recalled. \"Instead, the focus was on a person who couldn't gain access because he was ill-equipped. I wanted folks to have a different frame that was around a broken democracy, not a broken individual.\" Starks is among the more than 200 black men who signed the AAPF letter on the shortcomings of My Brother's Keeper. In addition to overlooking girls and women of color, he says, MBK lacks a structural analysis of racial inequity. The initiative's emphasis on personal responsibility rather than institutional barriers enables billionaire stop-and-frisk defender Michael Bloomberg and Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly to endorse the effort. On Twitter, CNN commentator and educator Marc Lamont Hill took issue with MBK's singular focus on males-\"I guess I don't concede that black women are in favorable position vis a vis black men\"-but also questioned whether expanding the initiative was the best solution: \"I have no desire to expand My Brother's Keeper, but to scrap it altogether in favor of more humane and democratic policy.\" Starks ticked off a list of pressing issues-affirmative action, minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit-that he says have been ignored by many program officers now closely aligned with MBK. Meanwhile, he added, programs that promote responsible fatherhood or facilitate rites of passage are well-supported. The question that really motivates funders, Starks said, is: \"How do we teach them how to, quote-unquote, man up?\" Sometimes the message to \"man up\" can be subtle, as it was during a session I attended at the College Bound Brotherhood event, where Tremeal Bradford, an admissions counselor at UCLA, addressed a group of young men. A native of Compton, Bradford transferred from Santa Monica College, a two-year school, to UCLA and graduated in 2009; he now works in the UCLA admissions office. When talking to the audience about time management, Bradford turned up the swagger, telling the young men-who were listening with rapt attention-that \"time is the ultimate pimp. True leaders in life, they learn how to pimp time.\" Was the reference a youthful misstep-or did it go to the heart of critics' misgivings about what's being communicated in some gender-specific programs for boys and men of color? When I talked to him later, Bradford said he hadn't meant any harm. \"I look at pimping as taking full advantage of the resources available to you,\" he said. He insisted that his word choice, much like the references he makes to rap lyrics and pop culture, helps make him relatable to young people.

The Oakland-based project, which receives financial support from OSF's Campaign for Black Male Achievement, encourages people of all gender identities, particularly those in communities of color, to challenge traditional understandings of masculinity. The organization facilitates \"leadership circles\" in which participants, primarily transgender men and women who identify as \"masculine of center,\" talk about how they can express themselves outside the confines of gender norms. Though in the minority, straight cisgender boys and men are included, field director Erica Woodland tells me. In a Brown Boi circle, the use of a loaded word like \"pimp\" would raise conversation around its origins and meaning, Woodland adds: \"If, to be relatable, you need to use language that reinforces violence against women, then that's a problem.

The award-winning journalist, author, and attorney Malaika Jabali recently relocated to the state, and her work has led her to dig into the data where she's found that Wisconsin is one of the most racially unequal states in the country. Housing costs are up; wages are not. It has the highest Black male incarceration rate, according to The Sentencing Project. And perhaps unsurprisingly, Wisconsin has seen a record drop in Black voter turnout. Is any party or politician running today offering a fix? Malaika Jabali is the former senior news and politics editor at Essence magazine. She has written for Teen Vogue , The Guardian , and others. Her first book, It's Not You, It's Capitalism: Why It's Time to Break Up and How to Move On is out this year, and she is hard at work on a new book about Black Midwesterners.\n\n-Laura Flanders\n\nLaura Flanders: You wrote a piece about economic anxiety, particularly Black economic anxiety and voting patterns in Milwaukee some years ago. What was it that drew you to that place then, and what keeps you there?\n\nMalaika Jabali: For one, it was looking at the low voter turnout from 2012 to 2016. I wanted to figure out what was going on behind the numbers. I felt that there was a very extensive narrative that I think we're still hearing now. It's almost a cottage industry of trying to figure out what happened with the white working class. What happened where you had voters who were switching from Obama to Trump? Why have so many white working-class people over the last few decades gone to the Republican Party? On the other side of that, you have a lot of Black nonvoters. A lot of Black people are saying, \"We don't have any options between the Republican and Democratic parties. Those are our only two viable options.\" But voting for Donald Trump for many Black people is not an option. So they tend to stay home. It was me trying to understand what was going on behind the numbers that most journalists, I barely saw any journalism about it. This was back in 2017. All the pieces on what was going on with the election were missing a very crucial story.\n\nLF: The short film you made back in 2020 called Left Out talks to Black Milwaukeeans about the history of their state and where their city has come today. It seems to me that we have been greeting every election with what happened to the white working class, going back decades now. Is anything changing?\n\nMJ: If you look at some recent data, this is the least support and the least faith that Black people have had in the Democratic Party. The analysis tends to look at what are some of the more symbolic gestures that we can reward Black people with? We've got a Black vice president. We've got Black people in the cabinet. We've got Black people in this administration. But when you talk to people on the ground, a lot of that excitement and that allure really dulled after Barack Obama. People aren't just looking for firsts anymore; they're looking for substantive policy.\n\nLF: When you talk about the gestural versus the substantive or the systemic, what do you mean?\n\nMJ: There's symbolic gestures of appointments and getting a few Black faces in high places. When it comes to symbolic gestures, for instance, Hillary Clinton was known for saying that she carried hot sauce in her bag and that actually insulted Black voters. Maybe she did not mean it that way, but a lot of Black voters took it that way. And so, you've got this racial appeal on one hand, these cultural appeals, but then the lack of not only substantive policy but a lack of substantive engagement with the community. Bernie Sanders actually won Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton ended up losing in their primary. Bernie Sanders got most of his Black support, he didn't get a whole lot throughout the country, but his highest Black support, at 31 percent, was in the state of Wisconsin.\n\nLF: How do you think Donald Trump is doing on this run? He's been trying to bond with African Americans, weirdly through fighting the carceral state, casting himself as some big victim of the criminal justice system. How do you think that appeal is going down?\n\nMJ: I don't believe that he's going to win Black people in Wisconsin. I do think that there is room for maybe a larger number than expected to shift to him. But when you look at Black people as a whole, they're not en masse switching to the Republican Party. Even if you look at 2020, he had plenty of cases against him and all kinds of criminality, and the way that he's even using that framing to try and appeal to Black people is just wildly racist. But he was facing that problem in 2020, and it's not like he won a large number of Black people. In fact, the voter turnout that year, even though 2016 was a historic Black decline in Black voter turnout, 2020 was even lower. So, it's not like he's winning over these people who would otherwise not be involved in the two-party system.\n\nLF: The Democrats would say, \"Well, but look at what we've done.\" We've seen the Inflation Reduction Act. We've seen the American Recovery Plan. We've seen a lot of money go into infrastructure and social supports. Is it visible in a place like Milwaukee?\n\nMJ: For the average person, I don't think they are aware of some of those policies. Some of the key issues that are affecting Black people, when you look at unemployment, when you look at housing costs and affordability, it's not going to hit that yet. As we know, infrastructure developments take a long time. So I don't think people are seeing that on the ground, but so much of this is because of generations of abandonment. The work that he might've been doing the last three years, I don't think is enough to quell the disillusionment that people have been having with the party, really since the 1970s and '80s.\n\nLF: That brings us to the systemic question that you pose in your last book about breaking up with capitalism. Maybe the problem is bigger than any individual candidate or party.\n\nMJ: I think it is bigger than both parties. Housing for Black America is worse than it was in 1968 before the Fair Housing Act passed. Home ownership rates have barely budged. When you look at the affordability of college, it's gotten way more expensive, and Black men and women are more likely to carry student loan debt. Many things that should have been a part of our social safety net have been marred by this kind of individualism and anti-Blackness where everybody's not able to thrive from it. Instead of community programs, you're looking at individual small business ownership. We've been trying that kind of inclusion for the last 60 years. DEI didn't get started when it became a boogie word for conservatives in the 2024 election. It's been affirmative action. It's been these kinds of inclusion programs over the last 60 years. If it were going to work, I think it would've worked by now. The purpose of the book is to say, \"Why don't we give another relationship a shot?\" This isn't even a new relationship. This is something that we had as an antidote to the Great Depression. This is something that we've had right here in real America, in Wisconsin. Let's return back to the things that actually worked for people.\n\nLF: You are working on a new book on Black Midwesterners. What are the questions you're asking? How are you thinking about this November and what's at stake?\n\nMJ: I'm just asking people what makes them lose interest in voting. We have to get at the heart of what it means to actually be a democracy. And when, for instance, you have a state like Wisconsin, where 47 percent of Black people have come out to vote, a majority of Black people did not show up in 2016, why? Instead of forcing people into these false choices, we need to ask them what makes them thrive? What would make their lives better? What kinds of choices can we have electorally to give them that life, instead of forcing them under this duopoly? My focus is on talking to people and asking what they want. What do they need? What are they missing? Do we even have a democracy? Have we had a democracy when it took so long for Black people to have the right to vote? And then, once they get it, they realize not a whole lot is changing materially. I've been seeing the writing on the wall for the past seven, eight years, and if you look further than that, it should have been clear. The signals have been there when you look at the simmering frustration. So it's giving people the historical context for their problems. This isn't just something that they're dealing with. This is a function of a democracy that has really become controlled by two capitalist parties. So what do we do with that? Are there other outlets for us?\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nWhy is the media talking so much about the fraction of Black men who might go MAGA when more than 60 percent of white men will vote for Trump?\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris takes the stage during a campaign rally on October 13, 2024, in Greenville, North Carolina.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris unveiled a platform of policies to court Black male voters this week, which she called the \" Opportunity Agenda for Black Men .\" The platform includes business loans for Black entrepreneurs, legalization of marijuana, and better regulation of the cryptocurrency market, which disproportionately predates on Black men.\n\nI've read her plan , because reading such things is part of my job, but speaking as just a regular Black male voter, I honestly and deeply do not give a shit. We are three weeks out from a presidential election against a deranged fascist named Donald Trump. I do not need nor require a personalized agenda addressing my particular issues at this late date-and if I did need one this would not be it, not the least because it doesn't contain any meaningful way to prevent the cops from harassing or murdering me and my Black children as we try to live out our lives in this racist country. The time for a Black male agenda was three years ago when Democrats briefly controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Because I understand basic civics, I will continue to address my questions to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema about why such an agenda never materialized.\n\nBut I'm not here to talk about the past. I do not need more reliable crypto and an NFT in my lunchbox telling me I'm a big strong man in order to choose correctly between a moderate Black woman and the obvious white supremacist who believes in eugenics. I will be voting for Harris on November 5, and then spend the 1,500 days between that date and the next presidential election in 2028 advocating for my version of a Black agenda. Going on TikTok to advocate for Black people in October means nothing if you don't show up with the same energy and ideas in January.\n\nIt might be tempting to write me off as a bougie negro who has lost touch with his community, but I'd like to point out that the overwhelming majority of Black male voters are going to do exactly what I do: vote for Harris. Harris will receive between 85 and 90 percent of the Black male vote. I acknowledge that the difference between 85 percent and 90 percent could be the difference in Harris winning or losing a critical state or two, but I simply refuse to engage in a conversation that paints Black male support as the \"problem\" for Harris in this election. Over 60 percent of white men are going to vote for a convicted felon. Somewhere around 50 percent of white women are going to vote for an adjudicated rapist and devout misogynist. Black men are not your problem, Democrats.\n\nThe \"problem\" in this country is how the majority of white people vote. The force holding this country back is the majority of white people. The people who have turned against democracy are the majority of white people. The global force destroying the environment of this earth is the majority of white people. If you are in the white liberal minority and you want to freak out about something, freak out about your cousins and grandmothers and colleagues who are about to cast a ballot for an unhinged authoritarian. Go deal with the white people in your life instead of placing the burden on Black folks to save this country from the majority of white folks yet again.\n\nOf course, asking white folks to look in the mirror and address their own bullshit has been the plea of every Black thinker and intellectual from Frederick Douglass to Chris Rock. This country has become comfortable with the idea that white support for white supremacy is inevitable. The white voters who will support this fascism are consistently treated by the media as if they are merely doing the very best they can given the economic and social forces they believe exist, even though most of what these white voters believe is factually, demonstrably wrong.\n\nThis fallacious idea that white people are always doing their best-and that it's up to everyone else to stop them if they disagree-is such a common feature of American political discourse that you'll still see a majority of white folks defend the enslavers and rapists who wrote the Constitution. They'll call these founders \"men of their times,\" even though there were other, better men (and women!) who knew in real time that slavery was wrong and that women should have political equality. The enslaved people, for instance, were \"men of their times\" and knew slavery was wrong. But most whites, even the \"progressive\" ones at the time, went along with the unforgivable evil of human bondage. The only time progressive white folks actually stood up to their racist brothers and cousins was in the 1860s, and the racist whites were so pissed about the normal operation of democratic governance that elected Abraham Lincoln that they seceded from the Union and started a civil war. Usually, instead of dealing with retrograde white folks, liberal whites look for somebody else to blame.\n\nIn this election, the powers that be have decided that Black men are the appropriate scapegoat. Yes, the overwhelming majority of Black male voters will vote for Harris, but what about those who don't vote? What about the dudes who will stay on the couch? Surely, if every Black man would just crawl over broken glass to vote for Harris, our democracy could be saved. Since not every single sentient brother will perform their assigned civic duty of saving white folks like the magic negroes we are supposed to be, clearly Harris must have a problem with Black men-or so the story goes.\n\nHarris does not have a \"problem\" with Black men. That said, she does appear, based on the polls, to be slightly underperforming Joe Biden in 2020 with... men. All men. White men, Black men, Latino men, AAPI men, men without a college degree, men with a college degree, working men, businessmen, and pretty much every other flavor of men-except perhaps Black queer men, who appear to be all in for the VP .\n\nGosh, I can't imagine why. Is the fact that America is the only major democracy to never have elected a woman as its leader something more than mere coincidence? Could it be that too many cis-hetero American men are pathetic little rump creatures who have been taught by their fathers and movies to view women as prizes to be won instead of equals to be respected? I guess there are some things we'll never know for sure.\n\nTo the extent Harris has a problem with men, there's literally nothing she can do about it. Harris could give Lady MacBeth's \"unsex me here\" soliloquy as a stump speech while wearing a fake beard like the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut, and it wouldn't make a damn's bit of difference to the misogyny crowd. She's running against a man who literally tells other men that it's OK to grab women by the genitals. The guys who want that to be true are never going to vote for a woman. There's not an agenda available that will persuade those kinds of men to not suck. To put that in a language those guys can understand: You can't reason with these men-you just have to kick their ass.\n\nThe same goes for her alleged problem with Black men. There's nothing she alone can do about it. A policy agenda that focuses on the specific hurdles that this country has erected before Black men cannot be addressed by fiat by the president of the United States. It takes legislation, passed by Congress. It takes courts willing to uphold the Voting Rights Act and enforce the equal protection of laws promised by the Constitution. It takes governors, state legislatures, and mayors willing to hold racist police forces accountable for their crimes and harassment. It takes politicians committed to advancing the issues important to Black men not for a few weeks every four years, but every day, relentlessly.\n\nWe do need a Black male \"opportunity agenda,\" not as a campaign sound bite, but as an ongoing commitment to give as much of a crap about Black men on November 6 as people will pretend to through November 4. More than any specific policy, I believe that with Kamala Harris, we have at least the possibility of that commitment, and that is my top ask in an election.\n\nAt the very least, I'm positive that Harris's commitment to advancing the opportunities for Black men extends beyond Trump's commitment to having Black men who are already successful shuck and jive for him at his rallies. The Democrats are far from perfect, but Trump and his Republicans are an anathema that offer tokenism instead of progress. As Dr. Christina Greer expertly explained in a recent piece, Black men are fantastic at voting for harm reduction. We know that the Democratic Party isn't going to really focus on us, but we also know that the Republican Party is going to focus on us-on hurting us, hunting us, crushing us and, given the slightest provocation and opportunity, shooting us.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nChris Lehmann\n\nBlack men are not magic, but we are protectors. Just like generations of Black women, we will put our bodies on the line to defend our families, our communities, and our humanity. Most of us will, at least-and around 85 to 90 percent of us will prove it again in the upcoming election. I hope that is enough to counteract the influence of all the men who are not like us.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Mr. Slater gave the program a try. He was assigned a \"success coach,\" who helped him identify academic goals. He was advised to sit at the front of his class and introduce himself to his instructors. He was urged to dress in a shirt and tie and to overcome his natural shyness to speak in front of groups.\n\nIn his second year, Mr. Slater was elected president of the student body. He earned an associate degree in business administration from the community college in 2013, and is now working toward a bachelor's degree at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.\n\n\"Once I got into the network, I saw that it was just a bunch of brothers in there cracking jokes - that studying was not all about being uptight,\" he said. \"I started pulling more and more people in, and letting them know that this is where they needed to be if they wanted to be successful.\"\n\nThe higher-education struggles of black men are well chronicled. Over the past 15 years, dozens of colleges have started programs designed specifically to get black men enrolled and help them graduate. So far, they are still significantly outnumbered and outperformed on campus by black women. But efforts to improve their experiences are likely to accelerate since President Obama's announcement in February of the My Brother's Keeper program, which includes philanthropic pledges of $200 million to help young black students.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump as supporting a \"common sense agenda\" on abortion and immigration.\n\nBut it was the sheer quantity that alarmed Mr. Hicks's father, Fred Hicks, 47, an Atlanta-area Democratic strategist. No one else in his family was being inundated like that, including him. And nothing similar was arriving from the Democrats or Ms. Harris.\n\nMr. Hicks's son is one of Georgia's most sought-after voters this election: a young Black man. Mailers are only one mode of campaigning and often not the most effective way to reach voters. But anecdotes of their uneven distribution have been enough to rattle some Democrats who see lagging Black male support as a warning sign for the vice president's campaign in the key battleground.\n\n\"They are young, they're volatile with respect to their opinions and their voting decisions and they don't have inherently the same loyalty to the Democratic Party that say, you know, their parents do,\" Fred Hicks said of young Black men like his son, whom he described nonetheless as a staunch Democratic voter. \"This is concerning to me not just for the 2024 election, but the payoff, I think for Republicans could come well over the next 20 years.\"\n\nBlack men are rivaled only by Black women in their high turnout and loyalty to Democrats. In recent surveys, the gap in support for the party between Black men and women is the narrowest of any race. Yet, more Black men under 50 have expressed in polling and conversations their openness to voting for Mr. Trump or staying home altogether - scenarios that could decide the election in hypercompetitive states, including Georgia.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They have both reported on the Biden administration's racial equity agenda.\n\nIn the final stretch of the presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris has been promoting her \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men\" to help boost turnout among a vital constituency whose support for her has been slipping.\n\nA close read of the plan, which focuses on the economy, entrepreneurship and jobs, shows how much Ms. Harris has learned over the past four years about enacting policies built around race. Such policies usually get held up in court or attacked by Republicans who cast them as unfair and woke-ism run amok.\n\nThat's why the fine print of her plan for Black men says it's actually a plan for Black men \"and others,\" a strategy to make sure it could survive legal and political challenges if she's elected.\n\nWhen President Biden and Ms. Harris entered office in 2020, they proposed a sprawling racial equity agenda that would distribute federal funds with a specific eye on communities of color and disadvantaged groups.\n\nThat effort encountered political obstacles and lawsuits at almost every turn.\n\nIn the end, some of the Biden administration's most prominent racial equity proposals were stalled , scaled back or redesigned to be colorblind , including those aimed at helping Black farmers who have endured generations of racial discrimination.\n\nAs the Democratic nominee, Ms. Harris has been mindful of those setbacks.\n\nDuring their 2020 presidential run, Ms. Harris narrated a campaign video featuring an illustration of a Black person climbing a mountain next to a white person, but starting from below ground level.

      "text": "Black Men Are Waiting for a Democratic Party That Delivers for Them\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Charles Coleman Jr.\n\nMr. Coleman is a civil rights lawyer, a former prosecutor and a co-host of the MSNBC special \"Black Men in America: The Road to 2024.\"\n\nBlack men today face a unique reality that warrants consideration: Under nearly any relevant index for measuring the quality of American life - how far we get in school , our finances when compared with those of our white counterparts, and how long we will live - Black men consistently rank last or near last. There is not a Black man alive in this country right now who has ever seen Black male unemployment equal to or less than that of his white counterparts.\n\nThis is true even more acutely for a 34-year-old Black man born in 1990 who may have voted in every presidential election since his 18th birthday, saw the election of a Black president and spent more of his adult life with Democrats in the Oval Office than Republicans.\n\nHow could we not be asking ourselves: Come November, which candidate can help us change course?\n\nHistory might suggest that Kamala Harris's campaign for commander in chief would be met with near unflinching support from much of the Democratic faithful - women, Black, Latino and college-educated voters . Pew Center data estimates that from 1994 through 2019, both Black and Latino registered voters have consistently identified as Democrats at rates higher than white voters. Yet in a moment where political allegiances of the past would seem to carry the day, Democrats are increasingly challenged in maintaining their stronghold among Black male voters.\n\nBlack men's reconsideration of the Democratic Party is the worst kept secret of the progressive left. Black voters who aren't Democrats still may be a small minority, but with the speed and reach of the internet these voices are increasingly amplified at levels exceeding what many ever thought was possible. Regardless of the outcome of the November election, Democrats cannot afford to dismiss this as tomorrow's problem. The margin for victory will be tight on either side, and even in a world where Ms. Harris is victorious, this issue is not going away or shrinking in its significance.\n\nIn many respects, Democrats have themselves to blame for this disturbing trend by not controlling what has been in their power to control. While Republicans seemed to ignore the Black vote entirely, Democrats failed to prioritize policies that would have spoken directly to Black voters.\n\nFor example, there is no reason that the expiring portions of the Voting Rights Act should have been left to the Supreme Court to begin gutting with Shelby County v. Holder when Democratic legislators had decades to codify many of its tenets. Likewise, a commitment to police reform would have meant that once the George Floyd police reform act died in Senate committee because of Republican stonewalling, Democrats should have remained dogged in their pursuit of these much-needed changes to police conduct.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Nowhere is the deficit more pronounced than at historically Black colleges and universities, like Howard. Credit... Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Clyde McGrady\n\nClyde McGrady covers race for The Times. He reported from Washington, D.C.\n\nBefore stepping foot on Howard University's campus, Skylar Wilson knew she would see more women there than men. But just how many more stunned her: Howard, one of the most elite historically Black colleges and universities in the nation, is only 30 percent men - 19 percent Black men.\n\n\"I was like, 'Wow,'\" said Ms. Wilson, a 20-year-old junior. \"How is that possible?\"\n\nHoward is not unique. The number of Black men attending four-year colleges has plummeted across the board. And nowhere is this deficit more pronounced than at historically Black colleges and universities, or H.B.C.U.s. Black men account for 26 percent of the students at H.B.C.U.s, down from an already low 38 percent in 1976, according to the American Institute for Boys and Men. There are now about as many non-Black students attending H.B.C.U.s as there are Black men.\n\nThe decline has profound implications for economic mobility, family formation and wealth generation. Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist who uses large data sets to study economic opportunity, has found that the income gap between America's Black and white populations is entirely driven by differences in men's economic circumstances, not women's.\n\nThe causes are many. Higher college costs, the immediate financial needs of Black families, high suspension rates in high school and a barrage of negative messages about academic potential all play roles in the decline of Black male enrollment and college completion. Howard estimates that its cost of attendance for undergraduates easily exceeds $50,000 a year.\n\n\"If we are serious about reducing race gaps in economic opportunity, household wealth, et cetera, then our attention should be squarely focused on economic outcomes for Black boys and men - period.

      "text": "What the Polls Really Say About Black Men's Support for Kamala Harris\n\nIn early October, just before Kamala Harris spoke at the Dort Financial Center, in Flint, Michigan, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer Magic Johnson took the stage to offer a few insights about the candidate and her campaign. The choice of Johnson, who is a Michigander, to introduce Harris made sense for several reasons. He has been an advocate for people with H.I.V./ AIDS -he has been H.I.V.-positive for more than thirty years-and Harris helped spearhead a Biden Administration effort to end the epidemic by 2030. He is a co-chair of the Athletes for Harris coalition. And, since he officially retired from basketball, in 1996, he has become known nearly as much for his shrewd investments in movie theatres and sports franchises as for his prowess as a point guard. In Flint, Johnson congratulated the Detroit Tigers on their playoff run, praised Harris for her economic proposals, and then spoke about a specific sliver of the electorate. \"Our Black men, we gotta get 'em out to vote,\" he said. \"Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things last time to the Black community that he did not deliver on, and we gotta make sure we help Black men understand that.\"\n\nJohnson was addressing a concern that has been alternately murmured and shouted in Democratic circles as Election Day nears: that Democrats are vulnerable with one of their most loyal constituencies, African American men. The statistical stalemate that the two major-party candidates have been locked in has led to a kind of obsessive demographic slicing in an effort to predict the election's outcome. In the traumatic wake of the 2016 contest, progressives blamed white women, more than fifty per cent of whom, initial reports alleged, had voted for Donald Trump , compared with forty-three per cent for Hillary Clinton. (Subsequent analysis revealed the numbers to be closer to forty-seven per cent for Trump and forty-five for Clinton, but it was still a win.) This year, Black men have come under special scrutiny as the potential weak link.\n\nA headline from a \"PBS NewsHour\" story in August noted that \"Trump Is Gaining Ground with Some Black Men.\" The same month, Mother Jones ran a story titled \"I Spent a Week with Black MAGA. Here's What I Learned.\" A Times piece led with \"Black Men Rally for Kamala Harris and Confront an Elephant in the Room.\" Trump himself weighed in, noting, \"I seem to be doing very well with Black males.\" In fact, according to a recent A.P.- NORC poll, only one in ten Black voters thinks that Trump would \"change the country for the better,\" and eight out of ten have a somewhat or very negative view of him. Trump won fourteen per cent of Black male voters in 2016, according to Pew, and just twelve per cent in 2020. But there was enough concern among Democrats that the Harris campaign gave a spot on the final night of the Democratic National Convention to the comedian D. L. Hughley to make the least common form of an endorsement speech: an apology.\n\nHughley confessed that, because Harris had been a prosecutor, he made assumptions about her, and \"often repeated them to a lot of people.\" But, he added, \"I was wrong. And I'm so very glad I was wrong, because, Kamala, you give me hope for the future.\" He said that Harris had contacted him to discuss his doubts, and that he had then educated himself about her record as a public servant. He now describes himself as a \"loud advocate\" for Harris. The radio host Charlamagne tha God offered a similar conversion narrative. After previously lamenting Harris's relatively low profile in the Biden Administration, he said during a CNN interview this summer that he'd held \"an unrealistic expectation\" of her as Vice-President. He cites Harris's support for mental-health funding and her economic plans as reasons that he now endorses her. This week, he is scheduled to air a special show with Harris as his guest.\n\nWhatever the perceptions, though, Harris is doing better with Black male voters than Joe Biden was earlier this year. According to a recent Pew survey, seventy-three per cent will vote or are leaning toward voting for her. Even in mid-July, before Biden dropped out of the race, Harris's favorability rating among Black voters in battleground states exceeded his by five points. A more recent poll from Howard University found that, in swing states, eighty-eight per cent of Black men over fifty and seventy-two per cent of those younger say they will likely vote for her. Still, Terrance Woodbury, who leads HIT Strategies, a firm that has done extensive polling on this part of the electorate, has pointed out that the issue goes far beyond Harris as a candidate, or-as Barack Obama chided last Thursday, at a campaign field office, before he spoke at a Harris rally in Pittsburgh-the reluctance that some Black men may have to vote for a woman for President. (It's worth remembering that Black men voted for Clinton in 2016 at a level that surpassed white women by thirty-six points.) Woodbury notes that \"Democrats have experienced erosion-a two-to-three-point erosion amongst Black men-in every election since Barack Obama exited the political stage. This is not just a Kamala Harris problem. This is a Democratic Party problem.\" A higher share of Black men than Black women identify as conservative. The declining number of Black male Democratic voters, like the Party's diminishing appeal to Latino and working-class white voters, may portend an ongoing realignment. Or it may, as Woodbury contends, simply reflect the Party's failure to craft messages that appeal to this part of its base.\n\nAccordingly, the Harris campaign has been preparing a package of policy initiatives that relate to the issues-entrepreneurship, homeownership-that consistently emerge in focus groups with Black male voters. But there is another dynamic that warrants mention: Trump's bombastic allure skews disproportionately male, and although young voters generally support Democrats, there is some evidence that young men may be a stealth asset for him in November. (Stephen Miller, Trump's erstwhile immigration czar, recently advised young men that proudly displaying their MAGA sympathies is the best way to impress women.) And Trump is more popular with Black men under the age of fifty than with any other segment of African Americans.\n\nThe election will turn upon a multitude of dynamics, some too subtle to be apparent ahead of time. In Flint, Magic Johnson worried that Black men might not understand that Trump hadn't kept his promises to the Black community. But comparatively few of them have found the siren song of Trump appealing. Should Kamala Harris not prevail in November, it will not be the fault of any single faction of the electorate. She will receive a large majority of Black men's votes. Whether that-and the turnout among the other parts of her coalition-will be enough to win her the Presidency remains to be seen. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Will Black Men Turn Out for Kamala Harris?\n\nVivid for Men, a Black-owned barbershop, occupies a second-floor space above the cobbles of Philadelphia's Germantown Avenue, where Black and white residents have been living together since the days of the Underground Railroad. On a recent evening, a dozen Black men gathered there, over hoagies from Wawa, to talk about politics. On the wall, a painting cast famous figures including Barack Obama and Martin Luther King, Jr., on horseback, with their wives smiling in the saddle behind them.\n\nNicolas O'Rourke, a baby-faced thirty-five-year-old pastor and member-at-large of Philadelphia's city council, led the discussion-part of a larger initiative by O'Rourke and three fellow young Black city councilmen to register two thousand and twenty-four of their peers to vote. Trump could poll better with Black men than any other Republican in fifty years, O'Rourke noted. \"Why is that?\"\n\nO'Rourke, who was elected in 2023, is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. Instead, he belongs to the Working Families Party, a progressive party that formed in the nineties. \"Their mission to build relationships among poor and working people aligns with mine,\" he told me. O'Rourke often votes for Democrats, but he is deeply ambivalent about the two major parties. \"Both are beholden to corporate America,\" he told me, adding that \"the winner-take-all, two-party system chokes out genuine political debate.\"\n\nEach man in the shop-including two barbers, a public-school teacher, a state representative, and various community organizers and businessmen in their twenties, thirties, and forties-represents a vote Kamala Harris needs to win the election. Black voters in Philadelphia proved essential to Joe Biden in 2020, helping secure his victory in Pennsylvania by roughly eighty thousand votes. \"Winning Pennsylvania requires winning these margins in Philadelphia,\" Christopher Borick, a professor of political science and the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, told me. Between 2020 and 2024, however, support for Biden among Black voters dropped from ninety per cent to seventy-five per cent-a decline of some hundred thousand votes. That margin alone would have been enough to cost Democrats the race. Then Biden stepped out. \"Harris can win back a lot of these voters,\" Borick said. \"But she's going to have to appeal to them on more than the issue of race.\"\n\nPaul Brown, the shop's owner, reclined in a vintage barber chair in white espadrilles. He'd been planning to vote for Biden. \"But that was just a vote against,\" he said. As soon as Harris entered the race, Brown donated to her campaign. \"When I see Kamala, I see my children,\" he said. His wife, an eye doctor with an office below the barbershop, is Tamil Indian, like Harris's mother. \"Now I'm energized,\" he said.\n\nOthers in the room felt differently. \"She's not for Black people,\" Cortez James, a businessman in gold-framed glasses and a black polo shirt said. \"She says she's for everybody, and, when anybody says that, Black people slide down to the bottom.\"\n\n\"Who will you vote for?\" O'Rourke asked him.\n\n\"Who do you think?\" James replied.\n\n\"Kamala?\" O'Rourke guessed.\n\n\"Heck no-I'm voting for Trump!\" James said. \"You can pray and do all this community stuff, but if you don't got no bread, forget it.\"\n\nO'Rourke, in brown jeans and a backward baseball cap from the city's largest food bank, Philabundance, sat earnestly watching the fray. He didn't try to convince anyone, jumping in only to ask questions.\n\n\"Are you a Republican?\" O'Rourke asked.\n\n\"No. I'm an independent,\" James said. \"I vote for the interests of Black men.\"\n\n\"You think he'll be better for Black men?\" O'Rourke asked. James didn't answer.\n\nIn Philadelphia, O'Rourke is well positioned to make such connections on Harris's behalf, swinging \"soft\" Trump voters to her cause. Growing up between Ohio, Indiana, and Florida, he was raised in a conservative Baptist household. He noted that he has family members who have farmed, owned small businesses, and served in the military. His mother was deeply committed to teaching O'Rourke and his older brother, Brian Webb, about their identity as Black men. \"We had books in Swahili on the coffee table,\" he told me.\n\nO'Rourke was awarded free tuition at Central State University, an H.B.C.U. in Ohio, where his father worked as a janitor. For the first years of college, he was a young conservative in Indiana. He also worked as a youth pastor. One evening in 2005, a woman in a hijab came into Bible study at his church seeking volunteers for a nonprofit that worked to reduce teen incarceration. \"It's kind of corny to say, but we locked eyes,\" the woman, T. Leslie O'Rourke, told me. The two kept in touch on Facebook, and O'Rourke worked up the courage to ask her out. Eventually, they got married.\n\nObama's first Presidential campaign served as O'Rourke's political awakening. \"It sounds too simple, but seeing someone who looked like me running was mind-blowing,\" he told me. \"It was a case of seeing someone become the thing you thought you could never be.\" The day after Obama won the election, O'Rourke donned a suit to go to class. \"There wasn't any reason other than it was a kind of pride,\" he said.\n\nAfter the election, when Obama's campaigning effort, Obama for America, morphed into Organizing for America, O'Rourke joined as a staff member with the express purpose of helping young people engage in democracy. He also decided to become a pastor.\n\n\"I saw myself in the Black prophetic tradition,\" he told me. \"Not just preaching and waxing eloquent, but struggling and working toward materially improving the lives of 'the least of these.' \" In 2016, he and T. Leslie moved to Philadelphia, where O'Rourke serves as pastor of Living Water United Church of Christ, a progressive congregation. In 2019, when he first ran for Philadelphia City Council, he joined the Working Families Party. His wife works in marketing at J. P. Morgan. \"It's different,\" he said, laughing. \"I'm anti-capitalist, and she works for Jamie Dimon.\"\n\nDespite the ideological differences, there's little tension between them. \"Both of us align on the problems that need to be fixed-eradicating poverty and homelessness,\" T. Leslie told me. \"We just see the solutions differently. He believes billionaires shouldn't exist. I see the need to provide opportunity and financial literacy in underserved communities.\" She also remains a practicing Muslim. \"Our difference in faith is never at issue,\" she said. \"There are so many ways to get to God.\"\n\nT. Leslie's commitment to her faith has affected her politics, particularly in relation to the war in Gaza. She was one of nearly a hundred thousand Pennsylvanians who voted \"uncommitted\" in the Democratic primary to signal her opposition to the Biden Administration's support for Israel . Still, she had planned on voting for Democrats in the general election, and she thought Harris presented a possibility for change. \"Just being openhearted and having more compassion, she represents a shift that people are willing to engage with,\" T. Leslie told me. She was excited about Harris for other reasons, too. \"She's my sorority sister,\" she said-like Harris, T. Leslie joined Alpha Kappa Alpha-and, \"as a woman of color, she also looks like me. I know how that experience with Obama changed Nicolas, and I think it's the same with me.\"\n\nO'Rourke sees many more Black men leaning toward Trump than Black women, an observation borne out by polling, which has shown a dramatic gender gap in this election, especially among young people. He spends time online, in what he and others call the \"manosphere,\" where he has watched Trumpism spread on various Christian and hip-hop sites. He pulled up one where a rapper was insulting the rainbow flag, and another supposedly Christian site that was rife with conspiracy theories.\n\n\"If we're going to engage Black men across the country then that has to happen online and in text threads with friends everywhere as credible messengers,\" he said. O'Rourke is in close touch with childhood friends in Ohio, Georgia, and Virginia. Some have remained Republican, while others are the kind of conservative Christians whom Trump is trying to reach. He and his old friends share long conversations about \"everything\" he said: \"sports, gaming, leadership, spirituality, and the assassination attempt.\"\n\nO'Rourke also speaks frequently with his brother Brian, a homesteader and Iraq veteran who spent six years in military prison and now runs a farm in Daleville, Indiana. \"Just getting good, intelligent conversation is valuable,\" Webb told me. \"I live a pretty isolated life.\" On his farm, Webb grows his own vegetables and has taught himself to raise and slaughter chickens and ducks. \"In this weird time, we're trying to be in control of the things people have to have,\" he said.\n\nWebb had been planning to vote for Trump, in part because of Trump's felony conviction . \"If Trump can have the nuclear codes and be a felon, then maybe I would be allowed to run for sheriff in my county,\" as he put it. Then Harris entered the race, and, with his brother and his wife in his ear, he started to change his mind. \"I thought I knew who I was going to vote for, but people are fired up, and I'm thinking she can convince me,\" he told me.\n\nO'Rourke wasn't surprised at his brother's change of heart. \"Supporting Kamala is less about what Black men are fired up about than the excitement of their wives, daughters, and aunties,\" he told me, pulling up a picture of his mother and brother on his phone. From a distance, she resembled Harris. \"See?\" he said. \"I can't deny the power of that image. We will see in her the woman who first taught us what Blackness is about.\"\n\nOne recent morning, O'Rourke, wearing a well-fitted gray suit and shiny brown shoes, led some forty high-school students on a tour of Philadelphia City Hall which ended in a mock session in the legislative chamber. In the grand room, with marble arches and gold brocade drapes, O'Rourke invited each student to offer a public comment from a podium. \"Our school is leaking,\" a young woman offered, scrolling through notes on her phone. After a sleepy young man mumbled his comment, O'Rourke encouraged him to stand up straighter and speak louder, so that politicians would know his thoughts mattered. \"Don't be shy,\" he said. \"This is the people's house,\" he said.\n\nAfterward, Shawn Mays, eighteen, with braces, and headed to Howard University this fall, approached O'Rourke with a more personal question. \"Where did you get that suit?\" he asked. O'Rourke saw a teachable moment about capitalism. It didn't really matter what store his suit came from. \"You could buy one for eighty-five dollars,\" he said gently. The trick wasn't the label; it was the fit. \"You just have to take it to a tailor for another thirty-five so it fits you.\"\n\nWhen O'Rourke left the chamber, I asked Mays for his thoughts on the Presidential election. Mays hadn't registered to vote yet, despite the fact that his grandmother, who was worried about what the Republicans would do to Social Security, had been pestering him to do so. She'd wanted him to vote for Biden. Mays wasn't interested. The prospect of voting for Harris, who'd attended Howard, also hadn't swayed him. \"All I hear about her is locking people up for minor charges like marijuana,\" he told me. Yet meeting O'Rourke had changed his mind about voting. \"He truly made me see the candidates in our local community differently,\" he told me. He hadn't determined whether he would vote for Trump or Harris. \"I still am going into the race undecided,\" he told me.\n\nO'Rourke's efforts also drew in older voters. One steamy morning, he delivered doughnuts and fans at Brith Sholom House, an apartment building for seniors that had been declared unfit for occupancy. The residents milled around outside the high-rise, telling O'Rourke of hot-water and elevator outages.\n\nGregory Mays (no relation to Shawn), seventy-five and a former Amtrak worker, lived on the sixth floor, where another resident had recently died. Caution tape and plastic sheeting still covered the open gap where emergency services had kicked in the door. Mays was a rare Black \"diehard\" Republican, as he put it, who'd joined the Party decades earlier, when a local leader promised to pay off his parking fines. He had voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. \"I vote the ticket no matter what,\" he said.\n\nMays said that, as a Christian, he admired some of the pastors who supported Trump-\"especially Billy Graham's son, Franklin\"-but he'd grown disillusioned with him. \"I think that bullet grazing his ear was God smacking Trump upside the head,\" he told me. On TV, he'd learned about Project 2025 , the nine-hundred-page document organized by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation , which lays out an agenda that includes gutting public education.\n\n\"All the insulting remarks that Trump made against Black men, there's no way I can vote for that,\" he said. He wasn't going to vote for Biden, or any Democrat, until Harris entered the race. \"I might vote for Kamala,\" he said. \"She's a Black woman, and it's a matter of blood.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated when T.

      "text": "The Unknown History of Black Uprisings\n\nSince the declaration of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s birthday as a federal holiday, our country has celebrated the civil-rights movement, valorizing its tactics of nonviolence as part of our national narrative of progress toward a more perfect union. Yet we rarely ask about the short life span of those tactics. By 1964, nonviolence seemed to have run its course, as Harlem and Philadelphia ignited in flames to protest police brutality, poverty, and exclusion, in what were denounced as riots. Even larger and more destructive uprisings followed, in Los Angeles and Detroit, and, after the assassination of King, in 1968, across the country: a fiery tumult that came to be seen as emblematic of Black urban violence and poverty. The violent turn in Black protest was condemned in its own time and continues to be lamented as a tragic retreat from the noble objectives and demeanor of the church-based Southern movement.\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, in August, 2013, then President Barack Obama crystallized this historical rendering when he said , \"And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that, during the course of fifty years, there were times when some of us, claiming to push for change, lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots. Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse-making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination.\" That, Obama said, \"is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided.\"\n\nThis perception of riots as the decline of the nonviolent movement has marginalized the study of them within the field of history. As a result, our conventional wisdom about \"the riots\" of the sixties vastly underestimates the scale of Black insurgency and its political meaning. In her new book, \" America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s ,\" the Yale historian Elizabeth Hinton recovers a much longer and more intense period of Black rebellion, which continued into the nineteen-seventies. In doing so, she challenges the dismissal of what she describes as the \"violent turn\" in Black protest, forging new ground in our understanding of the tactics employed by African-Americans in response to the extralegal violence of white police and residents and the unresolved issues of racial and economic inequality.\n\nUsing data compiled by the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence, Hinton compiles a breathtaking list of more than a thousand uprisings, far beyond those with which we are most familiar. We have vastly underestimated the degree to which America was literally on fire from 1968 to 1972, years that Hinton compellingly describes as the \"crucible period of rebellion.\" Indeed, there were more than six hundred rebellions in 1970 alone. Hinton also makes the key finding that almost all of these rebellions came in response to escalating police interventions, intimidation, and harassment. She writes, \"The history of Black rebellion across regions and decades demonstrates a fundamental reality: police violence precipitates community violence.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1968, in Stockton, California, two police officers tried unsuccessfully to break up a party in a public-housing development. The situation quickly escalated when more than forty more white cops arrived, Hinton writes, turning the \"party into a protest.\" Police ordered the crowd to disperse; instead they pelted police with rocks and bottles. The police made some arrests, but they hardly restored order. The following day, two officers were dispatched to investigate reports of a disturbance at the gym in the housing development; residents locked the cops inside the gym, and, Hinton writes, for more than two hours, a crowd of two hundred and fifty people \"hurled firebombs, rocks, and bottles at the building screaming 'Pigs!' and other expletives.\" More than a hundred police, sheriff's deputies, and highway patrolmen arrived on the scene; the crowd released the two officers but continued to throw firebombs at the gymnasium, nearby cars, and even an elementary school. Many of them were teen-agers. Eventually, police called their parents, a strategy that worked as the kids finally went home.\n\nIn Akron, Ohio, in August, 1970, police attempted to break up a fight between Black youths; a gathering crowd attacked them with rocks for several hours. The following day, the violence escalated, as young people hurled heavier debris, such as concrete blocks and bottles, and damaged cars and injured bystanders. Finally, after two days of skirmishes with police, Hinton writes, \"one thousand people, mostly of junior high school age, came out throwing rocks and other objects.\" Police deployed more than thirty cannisters of tear gas to disperse the rebels, but the presence of police was, itself, the provocation. Officers moved to the perimeter so they could monitor but not further agitate the crowd. This was a short-lived strategy: they then made another show of force, touching off another round of conflict, which, according to reports, resulted in property destruction.\n\nSimilar rebellions occurred from Lorman, Mississippi, to Gum Spring, Virginia, in 1968, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1970. Though the South is seen as the site of the nonviolent civil-rights movement and the North as where its noble objectives died, the wide scale of Black uprisings, from Southern towns to Midwestern cities, reveals widespread dissatisfaction with peaceful protest as a means to accomplish social change-which may suggest that we reconsider the assumption that the civil-rights movement was successful. For Hinton, the sheer scale of the uprisings, involving tens of thousands of ordinary Black Americans, challenges the idea that these were mindless \"riots\" involving wayward or misguided people. So, too, does the fact that Black violence almost always came in response to white violence aimed at controlling the ambitions and lives of Black people. Hinton writes: \"These events did not represent a wave of criminality, but a sustained insurgency. The violence was in response to moments of tangible racism-'a single incident,' as [President Lyndon] Johnson said-almost always taking the form of a police encounter. Yet the tens of thousands of Black Americans who participated in this collective violence were rebelling not just against police brutality. They were rebelling against a broader system that had entrenched unequal conditions and anti-Black violence over generations.\"\n\nHinton is not just recovering Black resistance; she is also exposing a long, and ignored, history of white political violence, used to maintain the subordinated status of Black communities. Hinton's book begins by acquainting readers with the history of post-emancipation white vigilantism, which lasted well into the twentieth century. The most infamous of these assaults took place in 1921, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where three hundred African-Americans were massacred by their white neighbors. But, even after the Second World War, as millions of Black Americans escaped the suffocating racism of the American South, they were greeted elsewhere by white mobs anxious to keep them confined to segregated enclaves. It is no exaggeration to say that tens of thousands of white people participated in riotous forms of violence to, as Hinton writes, police \"the activities of Black people and to limit their access to jobs, leisure, the franchise and to the political sphere.\"\n\nWhite police were not only reluctant to arrest white perpetrators; in many instances, they participated in the violence. Hinton dedicates an entire chapter to the ways in which white supremacists and police converged, in the name of law and order, to dominate rebellious Black communities. Outside of large metropolitan areas, understaffed police forces deputized white citizens to patrol and control Black protests. According to Hinton, in August of 1968, in Salisbury, Maryland, the police department \"installed an all-white, 216-member volunteer force to aid the regular 40-man force in the event of a riot.\" In other instances, white cops allowed white residents to harass, beat, shoot, and even murder African-Americans with no reprisals. In the small town of Cairo, Illinois, a Black rebellion in 1967 brought together white police and white vigilantes in a concerted effort to isolate and suppress African-Americans. After the initial uprising, sparked by the suspicious death of a Black soldier in the city jail, white residents formed a vigilante group dubbed the Committee of Ten Million-a name inspired by a letter written by the former President Dwight Eisenhower, which called for a \"committee of ten million citizens\" to restore law and order after the uprisings in Detroit and Newark. Cairo police deputized this group to patrol Black neighborhoods, including the public-housing development Pyramid Courts, where the majority of the nearly three thousand Black people of Cairo lived. In 1969, the \"white hats,\" as the committee members had taken to calling themselves, fired shots into Pyramid Courts. When Black residents took up arms in self-defense, periodically curfews were imposed but applied only to Pyramid Courts residents. In response, the National Guard was periodically deployed to police Pyramid Courts. But local police would also fire into the development with machine guns from an armored vehicle (described by Black locals as the Great Intimidator). No one was killed, but Black families would sometimes sleep in bathtubs to avoid the gunfire. Black men also shot out the street lights to obscure the view of white snipers. This amounted to a war on the Black residents of Cairo, which lasted until 1972. Hinton recounts that the mayor of Cairo gave an interview to ABC News, in 1970, in which he said, of Black citizens, \"If we have to kill them, we'll have to kill them. . . . It seems to me that this is the only way we are going to solve our problem.\" Hinton goes on to observe that, in all of the hundreds of rebellions of this period, \"the police did not arrest a single white citizen. . . . even though white citizens had been perpetrators and instigators. White people could attack Black people and face no consequences; Black people were criminalized and punished for defending themselves and their communities.\"\n\nHinton builds upon the arguments of her previous book, \" From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime ,\" to explain how the rebellions of the 1968-72 period came to be overlooked. Lyndon Johnson's declaration of a \"war on crime,\" in 1965, opened up new and lavish spending to local law enforcement, reducing the need for the deployment of the National Guard and federal troops to put down Black rebellions. The absence of federal intervention removed these conflicts from national focus, making them local matters. Meanwhile, the buildup of local police forces, loosely packaged as \"community policing,\" promoted police encroachment into all aspects of Black social life, transforming typical youthful transgressions into fodder for police assaults on young Black people. Places where Black youth congregated, including public-housing developments, public schools, and historically Black colleges and universities, were now sites of police surveillance and potential arrest. These encounters between police and Black youth set the stage for what Hinton describes as \"the cycle\" of police abuse, in which police incursions provoked a violent response, which justified greater police presence and, in another turn, more combative responses. In this period, which saw the ascendance of the Black Panther Party and the radicalization of Black politics far beyond the expectation of simply achieving equality with whites, young Black people in working-class communities fought back against police attempts to criminalize their daily activities or to ensnare them in the life-altering criminal-justice system.\n\nBlack resistance took different forms, from Black residents pelting police with bricks and bottles to Black snipers shooting at police, with the purpose of driving them out of their communities. Black snipers, in particular, fulfilled political fantasies that demonized all forms of Black resistance as pathological and deserving of violent pacification. From 1967 to 1974, the number of police killed in the line of duty jumped from seventy-six to a hundred and thirty-two, the highest annual figure ever. But those totals were dwarfed by the number of young Black men killed by the police in the same period. Hinton reports that, between 1968 and 1974, \"Black people were the victims of one in four police killings,\" resulting in nearly a hundred Black men under twenty-five dying at the hands of police in each of those years. By comparison, today only one in ten people killed by police is Black, according to the Centers for Disease Control. (Hinton cites this figure but notes that it may represent underreporting.)\n\nThis cycle of abuse could not continue. The crucible period of rebellion was over by the end of the seventies. It was not reform that brought its end; it was repression. Prison became a way of dealing with pugnacious Black youth. By the mid-seventies, according to Hinton, seventy-five percent of African-Americans imprisoned were under the age of thirty. Rebellion as a collective rejection of the quotidian acts of police violence became infrequent, she writes, as \"Black Americans had more or less resigned themselves to the policing of everyday life.\" For the past forty years, uprisings in response to police abuse have \"tended to break out only after exceptional incidents of police brutality or miscarried justice.\"\n\nIn some of the most powerful parts of \"America on Fire,\" Hinton systematically unravels the failures of police reform. More than fifty years ago, the Kerner Commission reached the damning conclusion that, unless there were a massive redistribution of resources into Black communities, patterns of segregation across the United States would deepen and, along with them, resentment and retaliation by African-Americans. As the report observed :\n\nNo American-white or black-can escape the consequences of the continuing social and economic decay of our major cities. Only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented scale can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of American society. The major need is to generate new will-the will to tax ourselves to the extent necessary, to meet the vital needs of the nation.\n\nBut, without clear mechanisms for enforcement of the commission's recommendations, they went unheeded. Kerner established a model for commissions on race, policing, and inequality that has persisted to the present, creating a rich archive of public hearings documenting the racism and abuse directed at Black citizens that has led to very little being done about it.\n\nThis bleak reality is evidence of the shortsightedness of the liberal premise that exposing a problem is the first step in its resolution. In fact, as the Kerner Commission explained, fixing those problems would require unprecedented action. It would mean using the powers of the judiciary and the federal bureaucracy to dismantle systems of residential segregation, school segregation, and the racial segmentation of American workplaces. It would also mean leveraging financial resources to end the endemic poverty that made Black Americans disproportionately vulnerable and visible to police in the first place. Instead, just months after the publication of the Kerner Report, Richard Nixon ran a successful Presidential campaign impugning Black rebellion as mere \"crime\" while arguing that he could restore law and order in the nation's cities. When running for reëlection, in 1972, Nixon coupled his theme of law and order and a new declaration of a \"war on drugs\" with an anti-welfare message that would become a theme of Republican politics for a generation, cohering a new, white \"silent majority\" around the politics of racial resentment and subordinating the demands of the Black minority. Hinton paints a bleak picture, in which the dual agenda of the Reagan Administration, of strengthening law enforcement while weakening social programs, helped to maintain the conditions that legitimized the expanding powers of police and growing prison populations. Though rising murder rates seemed to blunt the logic that more crime-control measures would make people safer, any skepticism was easily depicted as insufficient concern about safety and crime. Politically, elected officials goaded one another to demand tougher laws, tougher punishment, tougher enforcement. Between 1970 and 1980, the number of people incarcerated in federal and state prisons jumped by fifty per cent.\n\nMore than fifty years after the Kerner Commission, we have seen in the past eight years the return of Black rebellions in response to growing inequality that has been managed by the forces of racist and abusive policing. This is not history repeating itself; it is evidence that the problems that gave rise to earlier Black rebellions have not been resolved. Hinton observes that the \"contemporary movement for racial justice has built upon earlier traditions, creating a type of militant, nonviolent protest that blended the direct action tactics of the civil rights movement with the critiques of systemic racism that are often identified with Black power.\" Hinton argues that the persistence of inequality, coupled with new cycles of violence between the policed and law enforcement, is evidence that we must \"move beyond reform.\" But the enormousness of that task seems to stop Hinton in her tracks. She is not naïve about the difficulty of effecting the changes that are necessary to rein in abusive police while also solving deep and long-standing inequities that always legitimize policing. With this in mind, she avoids the temptation to neatly wrap up this history with simplistic suggestions for more public policies that stand no chance of approval or will inevitably fail to be enforced. She does, however, suggest that regressive-taxation formulas that starve public programs of funding be reformed. She also calls for establishing a justice system \"based on the principle of repair instead of retribution.\" But these recommendations pale in comparison with the power of collective protest that she expertly documents throughout the book.\n\nThere are no easy answers to the question of how to end the cycle of racist and abusive policing, but the force of resistance and rebellion has been the most effective way of both exposing the problem and pressuring authorities to act. The biggest difference between now and the earlier crucible period of rebellion is that today's uprisings are increasingly multiracial. Since the uprising in Los Angeles in 1992 and certainly the rebellions of last summer, Latinx and ordinary white people have been inspired by rebellion as a legitimate form of protest. The rebellions of last summer involved thousands of white people who were also angered by the abuses of police and by the deepening unfairness of our society. Protesters' demands to \"defund the police\" brought together new coalitions to challenge the entwined political realities of funding law enforcement and ignoring social-welfare services while injecting new arguments into the public discussion of this very old problem of racist police abuse. This won't end police brutality, but it can expand the number of people who also see themselves as victimized by deformed public policies. The larger the movement, the harder it is to maintain the status quo.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Racial Politics of the N.B.A. Have Always Been Ugly\n\nIn \" Black Ball ,\" a new book about Black players in the National Basketball Association in the nineteen-seventies, Theresa Runstedtler, a professor at American University and a former member of the Toronto Raptors dance team, lays out a compelling history of the league, and the origins of what we today call player empowerment. One case study is the arc of Spencer Haywood, who, as a nineteen-year-old from Silver City, Mississippi, strained to remain apolitical while playing in the 1968 Olympics-he made the team only because stars like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wes Unseld had sat out as part of an unofficial boycott -and spent the rest of his career battling exploitative professional contracts in both the N.B.A. and its rival at the time, the American Basketball Association.\n\nAs a twenty-year-old star at the University of Detroit, Haywood had played on an all-Black starting five, a rarity at the time, and lobbied for the team to have a Black coach. When the university instead brought in a white coach with a reputation for disrespecting Black players, Haywood signed with the Denver Rockets of the A.B.A. He explained that his mother scrubbed floors \"for ten dollars a week,\" and that his decision was one that \"anyone who loved his mother\" would make. In response, the press corps, which was mostly white, jumped to defend professional-team ownership and the colleges that profited from keeping players like Haywood in school for as long as possible. The media began spreading fears about unruly Black athletes who were trying to upend the system by signing professional contracts before they were ready, and leaving their poor college programs in the lurch.\n\nHaywood spent the first years of his professional career entangled in several contract disputes and a lawsuit that made it to the Supreme Court; the Court ruled in his favor. He was part of a movement of players who, inspired by Black radical protest, began to advocate for more choice in where and when they played, and for a bigger share of the money they generated. Another such player was Oscar Robertson, who later went on to lead the N.B.A. Player's Association. Robertson started his career with the Cincinnati Royals because he had played college ball at the University of Cincinnati, and the league at the time allowed teams to absorb anyone who played collegiately in their region. In the era before free agency, the league's reserve clause bound Robertson to the Royals for the entirety of his career. After he won the league's M.V.P. award, in 1964, Robertson was denied a raise in his second contract. So he did the only thing he could: he threatened to withhold his labor until he got a better deal.\n\nThe competition between the A.B.A. and the N.B.A. provided players with a form of leverage, and salaries rose as owners scrambled to keep their stars. But in 1970, talks about a merger between the two leagues-which would effectively destroy players' negotiating power-began to intensify. Robertson, by then the head of the Players' Association, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the two leagues to block the merger and won an injunction; the leagues wouldn't merge until 1976, when the modern N.B.A. was born. Public response to Robertson and the players' union was predictable, especially from the press, which called the players all the usual things-entitled, greedy-and waxed nostalgic for a fictitious past when players took small salaries and did it all for the love of the game and its fans.\n\nIn the late seventies, N.B.A.'s television ratings dropped, and some franchises struggled with attendance. From an economic perspective, these struggles made sense: the league was still going through growing pains from the recent merger of the N.B.A. and the A.B.A. But according to the press, the problem was player behavior and their sense of entitlement. The league was reeling from the fallout of an incident involving Kermit Washington, a Black player for the Los Angeles Lakers who, in the middle of a game in 1977, punched and seriously injured Rudy Tomjanovich, a white forward for the Houston Rockets. Three years later, Bernard King, one of the league's biggest stars, was arrested in Utah for cocaine possession and forcible sexual abuse. These high-profile incidents, which shocked the country, led to a great deal of questioning, much of it seemingly warranted, about what, exactly, was happening in professional sports.\n\nIn 1980, Chris Cobbs, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times , published a story about rampant cocaine use in the N.B.A and estimated that somewhere between forty-five and seventy-five per cent of players were on drugs. It was true that some players had recently been arrested for possession, but the story mostly reflected the way that the media, the league's white owners, and many basketball fans looked at a league in which seventy-five per cent of the players were Black-and therefore too flashy, too street, too undisciplined, and, most important, far too ungrateful for the opportunity they had been given to play basketball for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars.\n\nRunstedtler begins and ends \"Black Ball\" with a discussion of Cobbs's article and the league's cocaine panic. She argues that \"Black ballplayers' use of cocaine-an expensive drug typically associated with white celebrities, jet-setters, and professionals-was yet another reminder of their undeserved fortune.\"\n\nAt a time when the rest of the United States was still reeling from a decade of stagflation and economic recession, NBA players had become some of the highest paid professional athletes in the world. Many of them, Cobbs noted, came from \"unstable families in inner-city ghettoes\" and could not seem to handle their sudden wealth. Also, as one anonymous source told Cobbs, \"The players are so streetsmart, their sophistication is just below that of a hardened convict. They know every angle on how to get women and drugs. They are so far ahead of the security men it's unbelievable. They know every hustle.\" The chaos in the NBA seemed to mirror the chaos, crime, and violence in the streets of American cities. In both cases, young Black men were to blame.\n\nIt should surprise no one that demands by Black labor for fair contracts were met with a backlash that played into racist tropes about laziness, entitlement, and lack of discipline. It should also be a surprise to nobody that, at a time when cocaine was flooding into the U.S. seeking wealthy users, N.B.A. players would be among them. What Runstedtler illustrates is how all those facts are related, not just in terms of the accepted narrative but also in terms of the way the league exercises power over players.\n\nAs has been true across American history, Runstedtler shows, the ugliest instances of racist caricature and abuse come either when Black workers ask for equal pay and better working conditions or when business struggles and management needs someone to blame. This was true in the seventies and the nineties, when the sport struggled to gain or retain fans. What makes \"Black Ball\" one of the best and most politically truthful books on basketball is that it resists the alluring, simplistic narratives that often emerge in a business in which the worker is the product, and also happens to be world-famous. It's tempting to attribute every upswing and downturn in the N.B.A.'s business to the actions of individual players, whether it be the wattage of Magic Johnson's smile saving the Lakers from too many years of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dour workmanship or the league's popularity dipping when Allen Iverson brought \"hip-hop\" to the league. Runstedtler's feat is showing that the public narratives that emerge about the N.B.A. do not simply come from what fans see on the court, or even what players do in their free time. Their source, instead, is a decades-long battle between Black labor and white ownership.\n\nThe N.B.A. and the press that covers the league have certainly changed since the seventies and the eighties. Star players make hundreds of millions of dollars and can largely choose where they want to play after their rookie contracts are done. The media has also matured. There are now many more forums for discussing basketball, whether it's analytics-driven podcasts such as Nate Duncan's \"Dunc'd On\"; interview shows such as \"All the Smoke,\" which features the former players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson; or your usual sports-network yelling shows. There are hundreds of YouTube and TikTok channels dedicated to N.B.A. highlight reels. If you want to follow the league entirely by charts, there are several Web sites that will provide you with every metric you could possibly want.\n\nThis abundance, however, has not meaningfully changed the media's relationship with the league and its owners. The basketball press exists mostly to promote the league-it tends to be in sympathy with the management, not the players. In my experience reporting on the N.B.A., I can tell you that there is no other entity that I have encountered-including politicians, police departments, and other sports leagues-that is more needlessly hostile to criticism or which harasses journalists with such consistency.\n\nThe N.B.A.'s information ecosystem does not run on investigations but, rather, on micro-scoops about meaningless player transactions that get fed to celebrity reporters who mostly seem to exist on Twitter. Not only does this mean that \"sources,\" who are always unnamed, retain almost unimpeachable power because they are the fountain from which all the \"valuable\" information flows but it also elbows out nearly anyone who wants to hold the league to account or even cover it from a business or investigative angle. The league is doing just fine with its mostly tamed press corps, and can therefore just ignore any requests from investigative journalists or anyone who might be asking the wrong questions.\n\nLast summer, the Boston Celtics suspended their coach, Ime Udoka, for a season for unspecified sexual misconduct. In the days that followed, members of the N.B.A. media wrung their hands and ultimately decided to reserve judgment until the details came to light. But somehow those details still have not been reported in any major outlet, and Udoka is being talked about for head-coaching vacancies across the league . Surely the N.B.A. press corps is not so incompetent that it can't find a single publishable detail about a high-profile story involving a famous coach and one of the most storied franchises in the league. The more likely explanation is that a lot of people do know the story but have decided not to run it because doing so would jeopardize their standing with their anonymous sources, and, perhaps, the league itself.\n\nConsider that much of the N.B.A. press now covers the game from the perspective of a general manager tasked with fitting a bunch of player salaries within an arbitrary salary cap that benefits the owner. Contracts are called good or favorable when they save the team money; far less time is spent asking more salient questions like why the salary cap is set where it is, or, perhaps more pointedly, why any fan in their right mind would root for a billionaire owner to shortchange the athlete who actually is going out to perform for them. Instead, the media simply accepts the parameters that the league has set.\n\nThere's also a bit of a paradox here, though it's not particularly difficult to resolve. The modern N.B.A. media is far more progressive in what it says about race; it considers player perspectives far more than it did in the seventies. It gets in line with the N.B.A.'s desire to market itself as the progressive and youthful alternative to the brutality of the National Football League, both on the field and in its business, and the staid nostalgia of Major League Baseball. The media has done this in a variety of ways, both earned and seemingly spontaneous. The coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr have given lengthy statements about the horrors of police brutality. The league reserves a large slate of games for Martin Luther King Day and produces a glut of televised segments about the history of the civil-rights movement. As the George Floyd protests were taking place across the country, the league, which had sequestered itself inside a bubble at Walt Disney World to finish its season, covered just about every bit of space that could be spotted by a television camera with Black Lives Matter slogans, including on the back of player jerseys.\n\nBut the league also makes sure that such expressions are kept within the boundaries of what it finds acceptable. When Jacob Blake was shot by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, players on the Milwaukee Bucks, led by the point guard George Hill, refused to play in the bubble and nearly prompted the closest thing to a wildcat strike the league has ever seen in recent history. The strike ultimately ended with an assist from Barack Obama. As protests spread around the world, the N.B.A. games went on.\n\nThe central argument of \"Black Ball\" is that expressions of personal politics are nice, but largely irrelevant: as long as the relationship between labor and management maintains the same structure and incentives, a league with a Black Lives Matter logo on the court will still place all the blame on its players when things go wrong. As the Players' Association and the league prepare to negotiate their next collective-bargaining agreement after the end of the 2023-24 season, we should heed Runstedtler's advice to regard every story that comes out about \"load management,\" every scandal, and every leak with a great deal of skepticism. The league has earned that much. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "J. M. Holmes on Black Manhood in America\n\nIn your story \" Children of the Good Book ,\" a boy goes to stay with his aunt, uncle, and three cousins in Washington State, and becomes involved in their troubled family dynamic. How did the idea for the story come to you?\n\nMost of my stuff starts with some kernels of truth-either character-wise or place-wise or event-wise, because sadly I'm really not that creative. This one happened to have a little of all three. The three cousins I'm closest to are named Israel, Isaac, and Abraham. I had another story, published in my collection \" How Are You Going to Save Yourself ,\" where their likenesses were used to create the characters. Unfortunately, I always felt that their radiance didn't shine in that story, the way it always has to me. So I hope readers feel it in this one.\n\nThe story circles around the idea of Black masculinity and the ways in which these boys and men embody it, but also the ways in which that idea is imposed on them from outside. Bull has bought into a system that's rigged to keep him down; it's easy for the boys to mock him for that, but what choice did he have?\n\nWe all have choices. But I think sometimes as kids we imagine the world is going to be one way and then we grow up and learn that it's not that way. And Black boys, we tend to grow up a whole lot faster, since there is still a not-so-subtle undercurrent of fear surrounding our bodies and our personhood in this country-especially if we happen to be as big , physically, as my family tends to be. And then, when we're all together, we become even more of a target for that bullshit. I remember getting thrown out of a mall when I was thirteen or fourteen, 'cause security said we were intimidating paying customers.\n\nThat was a bit of a tangent. I think Bull reacts to Isaac because he understands that there is an element of truth to a lot of what he's saying. The pseudo-omniscient Isaac voice is somewhat of a counter to the harsh Libra scale we tend to weigh people with as children. When we have a fuller view of why people are the way they are, empathy can creep in more. Sometimes we just gain understanding and choose to judge folks nonetheless.\n\nThe three brothers are all named after figures in the Bible. Is there a resonance between the Old Testament Abraham, Israel, and Isaac and your characters?\n\nThe Isaac metaphor/allusion might be too on the nose in the story, so I won't go into detail about that, insulting readers' intelligence and whatnot. But Abraham is the oldest patriarch in the Bible. He is involved in so many stories, but I've always felt (and theologians and Bible scholars would know a lot more about it and probably disagree) that he is, in many ways, the least willful figure: he pleads with God a lot, but is dutiful to a fault-the binding-of-Isaac story being perhaps the most glaring example of that.\n\nBull becomes engaged in a power struggle with Isaac, who is his stepson. Why is there so much bitterness and anger between those two characters?\n\nThis returns to the question about Isaac ridiculing Bull-and to the societal confines, and, often, after those have been internalized, the personal confines that are placed on Black men in this country. This is at the heart of the anger between the two of them: Isaac feels that Bull has kowtowed to society and shown the docility that this country has always wanted from us. Bull feels that Isaac doesn't know shit 'cause he's a kid. . . . It reaches a fever pitch 'cause somewhere, deep down, Bull has internalized the poison, and there is shame in the gap between who he is and who he thinks he's supposed to be.\n\nThe struggle between Bull and Isaac culminates in violence. Did you know from the start how the story would end, or did that ending come to you in the process of writing?\n\nIt's kinda crazy, but I really do treat violence very carefully when I write-I often kinda ache while I'm writing it. Especially when Black men are hurting people. That's why I started Googling \"Can Americans move to Bhutan?\" after people thought the exact opposite about my début story collection. I couldn't take people saying that my book was a glorification of misogyny or that it was damaging to Black men. Violence, to me, is never a means to an end-it has to express something societally, or personally, or culturally, and usually it's a result of poisonous structures and expectations that are still rampant in 2021. So, short answer, no, I didn't know how I intended to end the story, but once I pushed their altercation past a certain point, I resigned myself to the fact that anything less than violence wouldn't be an honest exploration of the pain and fear that both of those men were harboring, and of the overwhelming shame that Bull feels.\n\nThe story is punctuated by italicized sections, in which an older Isaac addresses Bull and delivers a kind of political commentary on Bull's choices and lack of choices as a Black man in America. What inspired you to layer those sections into the story?\n\nThe story actually started with those sections, more or less. The first iteration of this story was from almost a decade ago, when I was twenty-one years old. (It's changed drastically since then.) But I was and still am one of the biggest Jay Electronica fans on God's warm green earth. And he has a series of lines in \"Exhibit C\" that essentially amount to a conversation between him and some Five Percenters: \" 'You either build or destroy. Where you come from?' / 'The Magnolia projects and the Third Ward slum' / 'Hmm . . . it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do / And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru.' \" And that rang true of Isaac for me-he's a building energy. There used to be a line in the omniscient sections where Isaac tells Bull, \"You were the minus and I was the plus. No, you were worse-you were neutral.\" So the Five Percenter wisdom filtered through Jay Electronica's voice became a stand-in for Isaac's in the story, and it kinda grew from there. If you've never listened to any of his stuff, it's worth your time. I feel like I learned more from my family and from music than I ever did at school. (Disclaimer: This is not me endorsing everything that Five Percenters teach or believe in. There are obviously some things in their doctrine that I find fucked up and problematic-as one could argue for most religious dogmas-but there is some wisdom and Black self-love and empowerment there, too, that I can really get behind. )\n\nIsaac disapproves of the fact that Bull does menial work for white people for low pay-what Bull calls \"honest work\" in a dishonest system. What does he think Bull should have done instead?\n\nThat's where some of that childhood perception of the world comes into play. At fifteen, it can be easy to say, \"I'm going to be a huge success and buy my momma a house and take my little sister around the world. And I'm not going to punch a clock for a white-owned corporate entity that would probably still have me literally in bondage if it could.\" But reality is reality. I think that's why the italicized parts are a different viewpoint on everything, which really embodies the Nation of Islam and Five Percenter spirit. Again, there's definitely some dubious history with Elijah Muhammad and Wallace Fard Muhammad and Clarence 13X, so say what you will, but those folks said, \"Black men are Gods. Black women are Earths. We as a people are supreme beings.\" To me, that's even better than calling ourselves kings and queens, as we do, and as has been mainstreamified in recent history. So that self-determination and belief in his inherent value, I think, is what separates Isaac from Bull; what Bull does for work is almost secondary.\n\nWho do you think has it worse, Isaac, who battles with a stepfather he has contempt for, or the narrator, who sees his father one month a year and, as he says, was never taught anything by him?\n\nHmmm, that's a weird \"pity-party\" question, haha. My friends and I talk about this fairly frequently, though, because some of us fall somewhere along this spectrum. The grass is always greener. I think America as a whole has it worse. When you look at how much money is spent yearly on health care (for life-style ailments and sicknesses), policing, and incarceration, how much in wages is lost to drug addiction, or even the social cost of our resenting one another, fearing one another, and cordoning off our communities against the mythical other , the real loser is America, 'cause the vestiges of slavery and systemic disenfranchisement will come home to roost. You have to deal with us one way or another.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Hiding Buffalo's History of Racism Behind a Cloak of Unity\n\nTension choked the air when a ten-foot-tall cross, wrapped in gasoline-soaked rags, burned wildly, as if to set the night on fire. The cross burned in the fall of 1980, on Jefferson Avenue, which runs  through several Black neighborhoods that constitute the East Side of Buffalo, New York, and it punctuated a wave of terror in and around the city. A month earlier, on September 22nd, a Black fourteen-year-old boy had been shot in the head three times. Over the next two days, three other Black men were shot and killed. After ballistics testing, the police concluded that all four had been killed by the same weapon. Then, in early October, the bodies of two more Black men were found, beaten and stabbed to death. Both men had had their hearts cut out of their chests.\n\nSeveral days after that, the cross was lit ablaze. The following day, on October 10th, a nurse walked in on a white man trying to strangle a Black man who was lying prone in a hospital bed. He survived, but the attack left him incapacitated and in need of surgery. In the course of those weeks, six African American males had been viciously murdered. The streak of deaths overlapped with a series of bewildering disappearances of Black children in Atlanta, which came to be known as the Atlanta child murders , heightening the terror.\n\nIn Black neighborhoods across Buffalo, rumors swirled that the killings were the work of the Ku Klux Klan. During one of the funerals, the Associated Press reported , two carloads of whites drove by with a \"mannequin with grotesque, red painted head wounds,\" and threw red paint on the hearse. City officials scoffed at the idea that organized racists were involved in the killings, and a state N.A.A.C.P. official allowed that the attacks may have been committed by a single killer. \"However, it is the climate of racism and conservatism in this country that is responsible,\" she said. A Black resident named Lattice Alexander told the Times , \"Some white people think blacks are getting ahead of them, even though that's not totally true. With the legal rulings over the last few years and all this unemployment they think they may be losing something because of us.\"\n\nAfter the killings, city officials dealt with rising fear and anger on the East Side of Buffalo. Three years earlier, Arthur O. Eve, a state representative in the New York legislature, had stood on the cusp of being the first Black mayor of Buffalo, after he shockingly beat James Griffin, a former state senator, in the mayoral primary. But Griffin, a high-school dropout based in South Buffalo, a mostly white area, resurfaced in the general election on the Conservative Party line, running on white-grievance politics: he opposed welfare, championed \"law and order,\" and supported the death penalty. Eve had made a name for himself by heading a solidarity committee that negotiated on behalf of prisoners in Attica state prison in the aftermath of the Attica rebellion . Griffin painted Eve as \"soft on crime.\" But, in the wake of the killings, Griffin lowered city flags and called for calm. Black youth had been pelting cars driven by whites with rocks. Jesse Jackson came to the city to plead for peace. Griffin, in a public plea, said, \"We can't let mean and vicious crimes like these separate us. . . . Buffalo is the City of Good Neighbors.\"\n\nLocal leaders have often invoked the city's invented \"good neighbors\" moniker to promote an ethos of gritty unity in Buffalo. In the aftermath of a racially motivated mass shooting at a Tops grocery store , which left ten African Americans dead, the current mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown, made the familiar plea, saying , \"We're standing strong as a community and working to not let this horrible act of hate detract from us being a loving, warm, welcoming community. Buffalo is known as the City of Good Neighbors, nationally and internationally.\" When New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, joined President Joe Biden to speak in the city to express condolences and present her plan to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future, she made similar gestures. She compared Buffalo to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden hails from. Hochul said , \"Buffalo's a little bit like Scranton, little bigger version of Scranton. You know, Scranton. You live a long time and you love your community, but you get knocked down a little bit and don't quite get the respect sometimes as other parts of your state do.\" She went on to say that, as a result, \"there's something called Buffalove. It's a combination of the words 'Buffalo' and 'love.' We call it Buffalove.\"\n\nThe effort to console and empathize can just as easily distort and conceal. Buffalo is not like Scranton, which has never had a population that was more than eight per cent African American. It is more akin to Philadelphia or Newark, with a large Black population constituting more than a third of the city. As in those cities, there is severe residential segregation, which keeps Black and white residents living in different social, economic, and political realities. In 1993, a writer in the local daily , the Buffalo News , compared Main Street, the central dividing line of the city, to the Berlin Wall, \"dividing rich from poor, the haves from the have-nots.\" Buffalo is one of the poorest cities in the country, and nearly half of children living in the city are poor. But the hardship that defines the city is not evenly shared. A disproportionate number of the have-nots live on the  East Side of Buffalo, where more than three-quarters of the city's African American residents live.\n\nLast fall, the University at Buffalo's Center for Urban Studies released a report titled \"The Harder We Run: The State of Black Buffalo in 1990 and the Present.\" The report was a follow-up to a similar one that my father, Henry Louis Taylor, Jr., had produced nearly thirty-one years earlier. The key findings were stunning in their similarity. In 1990, Black unemployment stood at eighteen per cent and the average household income was thirty-nine thousand dollars a year. Thirty-eight per cent of Blacks lived under the poverty line; there were more African Americans who had dropped out of high school than who held a college degree; and less than thirty-five per cent of African Americans owned their own homes. By last year, Black unemployment was eleven per cent; the average income was forty-two thousand dollars a year; some thirty-five per cent of African Americans lived under the poverty line; and only thirty-two per cent owned their homes. There continue to be more Black dropouts than Black college graduates. For most ordinary Black people, time has stood still. As the report concluded, \"Everything has changed, but everything has remained the same.\"\n\nWhen these conditions exist for decades, they come to be seen as the natural order of things. In the largely white West Side of the city, there are brick homes, grocery stores, shops, and gorgeous parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted . On the East Side sit ninety-four per cent of the city's vacant lots. In 2014, Evans Bank in Buffalo was sued by the state attorney general for engaging in modern-day redlining, excluding the entire East Side of Buffalo from its mortgage lending. (Bank officials denied that racism was a factor.) Money is being poured into a new stadium for the Buffalo Bills, and the restoration of the city's Art Deco-style Central Terminal. Meanwhile, on the East Side, residents struggle with busted sidewalks, most of which, according to the Center for Urban Studies, \"do not even have curb ramps and pedestrian crossings.\"\n\nWhen Joe Biden travelled to Buffalo to console the city, he spoke passionately about white supremacy, saying , \"It's been allowed to grow and fester right before our eyes. . . . No more, no more. We need to say as clearly and as forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America.\" But racial segregation and poverty were among the conditions that left Black Buffalonians vulnerable to a white-supremacist attack. (The shooter searched the Internet by Zip Code, looking for a location with a high density of Black residents.) Calls for reforms on these issues have largely been ignored.\n\nIn the United States, it has always been easiest to denounce virulent and explicit acts of racism. Still, it is clear that there is mounting energy to resist forms of racism that are not explicit but are still deadly and stultifying. The Black Lives Matter street protests in Buffalo during 2020 gave voice to a growing frustration over city government's claim of a \"Buffalo renaissance,\" which seemed to bypass most African Americans living in the city. Out of those frustrations came the improbable rise of India Walton , a registered nurse, socialist, former teen-aged mother, and welfare recipient, who rode the wave of anger over racism and inequality in Buffalo to win the city's Democratic primary, defeating the four-term Mayor Byron Brown. Brown eventually defeated Walton in an unprecedented write-in campaign, in part by accepting the help of Republicans who provided volunteers and fund-raising; the highest percentage of Brown's votes came from the mostly white South Buffalo. But Walton's campaign shone a light on the conditions of underdevelopment in Black Buffalo. Now the murder of ten Black people at the Tops grocery store has once again exposed the city's vicious inequalities. Locals fear that city officials and private enterprise will once again pay lip service to the tragedy and then move on once the news cameras have left. When I asked Walton what she believed the story in Buffalo to be, in the aftermath of the murders, she said, \"I am very disappointed that, like, already, in the media, the dominant narrative is that this was an out-of-towner, who mysteriously appeared and committed this act, rather than confronting the systemic racism that has plagued Buffalo. We have been pegged the fifth or sixth most segregated city for so many years. And we've not confronted that as a reality of where we live.\"\n\nIn 1982, Joseph Christopher, a white racist from Buffalo, was convicted of murdering three of the Black men who had mysteriously been killed in the fall of 1980. Christopher was initially linked to the Buffalo murders after he admitted to a psychiatrist that he \"had to\" kill Black people. But, in 1985, Christopher's convictions were overturned because the judge had improperly prevented psychiatric evidence from being presented at trial.  A year later, he was convicted again. He was ultimately implicated in the murder or assault of Black men not only in Buffalo but also in New York City and Fort Benning, Georgia, on an Army base, in 1981. Still, many city officials clung to a narrative that emphasized Christopher's mental illness over the racism that motivated his actions. Today, white supremacy is being loudly denounced for motivating the rampage at Tops. But, in both cases, it is important to remember that the racism behind the shooting didn't spring spontaneously from the killer's deranged mind but also emerged from a society that regularly disregards the conditions of inequality and poverty in poor and working-class Black communities. The attack in Buffalo might be taken as an opportunity not only to pass gun-control legislation and to confront the political phenomenon of white supremacy but also to transform the conditions that undermine the life chances of ordinary Black people. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Darryl Pinckney's Intimate Study of Black History\n\nEach summer, in London, I speak to a group of teens participating in Target Oxbridge, a program that encourages black students to apply to university. They ask me about my college experience and wonder what their own might be. One persistent anxiety trumps all: Will this make me less black? From here, the conversation expands into existential territory, as the students describe all the many behaviors and traits which they fear will place their blackness-in the eyes of others-in jeopardy. Things like reading or writing too much, wearing certain clothes, speaking a particular way, having been to private school, living in the countryside. Sometimes I ask them to imagine a group of white students sitting in our stead. What dangers could we conjure up that might put their whiteness in jeopardy? But we can only ever think of one item-extreme poverty-and even then it would likely not be their whiteness they'd consider endangered but only the privileges that may have once attended it. The imagined white students vanish. We sit together in our blackness and wonder: Can blackness really be so fragile that even a pair of narrow jeans may threaten it?\n\nIn Darryl Pinckney's life and work, blackness is not so easily revoked. In his essays, a selection of which appear in a new volume, \" Busted in New York and Other Essays ,\" blackness is as much in a black man's possession at a British pro-fox-hunting demonstration as it is at the Million Man March-or while reporting on the protests in Ferguson. He will retain it while writing operas in Berlin, or falling in love (with a white male poet), or reading Nancy Mitford. His blackness remains his even as he ponders the historical fact (alongside James Baldwin and Ta-Nehisi Coates) that race is, in the final analysis, a social and political construction:\n\nIn his writings, Baldwin stressed that the Negro Problem, like whiteness, existed mostly in white minds, and in Between the World and Me (2015) Coates wants his son, to whom he addresses himself, to know this, that white people are a modern invention. \"Race is the child of racism, not the father.\"\n\nAs a piece of rhetoric, this has become increasingly easy to assert, and many say it, but it is Pinckney's habit always to dig behind rhetoric to the historical record, where things are somewhat more difficult to say but no less true; for example, that blackness, too, must therefore be an equally modern invention, for white and black as categories are coeval, the creation of the first necessitating the other:\n\nColonial law quickly made a distinction between indentured servants and slaves and in so doing invented whiteness in America. It may have been possible for a free African or mixed-race person to own slaves, but it was not possible for a European to be taken into slavery. The distinction helped to keep blacks and poor whites from seeking common cause.\n\nPinckney's emphasis on the interpolation of class and race can make him appear closer to the leftist Afro-Caribbean tradition of race theorists-exemplified by thinkers such as Paul Gilroy and Stuart Hall-who reject mythical or essentialist theories of racism in favor of a concrete economic analysis, in which racial distinctions have been created and maintained primarily for the sake of capitalist exploitation. For Pinckney, blackness is not an essential quality found in the blood, the spirit, or even the genes (\"I'd never liked that way of assigning innate behavioral characteristics to whole nations or groups. The work of every serious social scientist militated against it.\") but a conceptual framework subject to history, like everything else. \"The Irish used to be black socially, meaning at the bottom,\" he writes in one example. \"The gift of being white helped to subdue class antagonism.\"\n\nOf course, to say something is constructed is not to say that it isn't meaningful. As Coates himself put it, with poetic succinctness, \"They made us into a race. We made ourselves into a people.\" And it is to the history of this people that Darryl Pinckney attends. The legislation to which we have been subject; the economic and social exclusion we have suffered; the experiences, both personal and public, that we have shared; our joys, our pains. But because he has a truly encyclopedic knowledge of black history-stretching far beyond America to every corner of the globe-the question of who and what this \"we\" contains remains at the forefront of Pinckney's inquiry. What exactly do \"we\" share? How do \"we\" diverge? From the concluding lines of his essay on Coates, \"The Afro-Pessimist Temptation\": \"Black life is about the group. . . . This remains a fundamental paradox in the organization of everyday life for a black person.\" Reading these lines, I thought of those students in London, never quite sure as to how or where they should draw the Venn diagram between the selves they feel so strongly and the \"we\" to which they no less profoundly belong. Can a diaspora be a monolith? Should it be?\n\nIn \"Slouching Toward Washington,\" Pinckney's account of attending the 1995 Million Man March, this question is no thought experiment but a pressing problem: \"Everyone seemed in a prescriptive frame of mind, willing to go on record about what black men and therefore black people needed to do.\"\n\nAs anyone who has been to a march knows, you find yourself on such occasions shoulder to shoulder with ideological brothers, cousins, and strangers, and, as moved as Pinckney is by the huge crowd, by the solemn courtesy each man shows the other as they move through the throng-\"Excuse me, brother . . . excuse me, black man\"-not every speech he heard that day spoke to him, and not every voice lifted was the song he wanted to sing. He hears \"a troubling capitulation in the exhortations that black men accept responsibility for their families\" (he hears the same capitulation thirteen years later, when Obama makes a similar cri de coeur) and wonders why all the men on the Mall that day should have to \"swear as black men not to beat their wives, promise as black men not to abuse their children . . . as if domestic violence and poverty were not also white problems.\" Pinckney is the inconvenient scholar who knows, when Louis Farrakhan stands up and purports to quote a letter of 1612, written by one Willie Lynch, slave master, that this letter is a fraud, written in language that in no way belongs to the early seventeenth century-and yet there is nothing vituperative in his style, and he's never out for anybody's blood. \"No doubt [Farrakhan] assumed that everyone understood the letter was apocryphal, a parable about fear, envy, and distrust, the means by which blacks are kept disunited,\" he writes.\n\nStill, the truth matters. \"An invented past can never be used,\" Baldwin argued, and Pinckney's historical precision reminds us that there is more than sufficient systemic oppression in the black past and the black present not to require any added fictionalization. \"Instead of Farrakhan's murky 'conspiracy of whites against blacks,' \" he writes, we might consider that, in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North and South Carolina, and Virginia passed anti-literacy laws, some of which included prison time for anyone who taught a slave to read and write (a fact perhaps worth offering to any young person who fears excessive reading is somehow \"not black\"), while, as Farrakhan speechified, there existed a perfectly nonfictional, racially biased criminal-justice system that destroyed the lives of far more than a million black men.\n\nWhen, in the book's title essay, Pinckney finds himself briefly incarcerated (for smoking a joint in the East Village), he recognizes at once his own distance, despite appearances, from his fellow-inmates (all of whom are black or Hispanic), a difference marked not by color but by class. (\"The irony, for me, was that an all-black gathering usually meant a special event, a stirring occasion.\") Raised in Indianapolis, in the black bourgeoisie of the early sixties-the world of N.A.A.C.P. meetings and black-owned newspapers, of prestigious black colleges and \"Negro History Week\"-he is attentive to the hierarchies of black struggle, even as the struggle itself renders his own experience invisible:\n\nBack then, as now, what constituted authentic blackness was determined by the plight of the majority, which meant the poorest . . . being of the black middle class could make you defensive. You were accused of trying to act white, of not knowing who you were. You were warned that one day soon it would be proven to you that you were black. . . . In the late 1960s, the black bourgeoisie was synonymous with Uncle Tom . . . depicted as light-skinned, clubbish, collaborationist, materialistic; and yes, there was too much of that.\n\nFor Pinckney, this image has also \"obscured the historical truth\" of his milieu. \"The old black middle class knew more than it wanted to about the front line,\" he writes. \"There was no refuge in success. A cousin of my mother's, a student at Atlanta University, was lynched in 1931.\"\n\nIt is this awareness of threat, the deadly patrimony of the African-American, that he takes with him as a journalist to Ferguson, listening to the testimony of the people he finds there, bearing witness. Embedded with members of Black Lives Matter and the Reverend Osagyefo Sekou, an activist pastor from St. Louis, Pinckney finds himself far from his usual habitat-the Schomburg library-hiding in the dark of a parking lot, listening to the sound of gunfire as \"buildings burned on either side of us.\" In Ferguson, too, he experiences a new generation's disappointment with the same President the old men in Pinckney's barbershop had heralded with the joy of a prize long deferred. \"Black youth are fed up with being branded criminals at birth,\" he writes. \"Ferguson was the country stepping back in time, or exposing the fact that change hasn't happened where most needed, that most of us don't live in the age of Obama.\" Pinckney does not share Sekou's contempt for that President (\"I wanted to say that Clarence Thomas is the race traitor, not Obama\"), but he understands that whatever future Obama symbolized was-to paraphrase William Gibson-at the very least unevenly distributed.\n\nSuch a schizophrenic reality, in which black power, in the form of a President, and black powerlessness, in the form of state violence and oppression, can coexist would surely bring out the Afro-pessimist in any reasonable man. (\"Given the little black people have gotten for it,\" the Reverend Sekou tells Pinckney, in Ferguson, \"voting fits the popular definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and each time expecting a different result.\") Yet to entirely elide the difference between the present and the past is to obscure the history of black activism found in families like Pinckney's, in families like Coates's, in the N.A.A.C.P. and the Black Panthers and Black Lives Matter, and in all the other organizations and individuals that have done so much to insure that the lives we are able to live today, however imperfect, are precisely not the same as they ever were. \"Which is better,\" Pinckney asks himself, to \"believe that blacks will achieve full equality in American society or to realize that white racism is so deep that meaningful integration can never happen, so make other plans?\" It is a question he does not answer as much as historicize:\n\nIn The Souls of Black Folk (1903), Du Bois argued that the influence of three main attitudes could be traced throughout the history of black Americans in response to their condition: \"a feeling of revolt and revenge; an attempt to adjust all thought and action to the will of the greater group; or, finally, a determined effort at self-realization and self-development despite environing opinion.\n\nAnd this insistence on historicization allows him to take the long view on many present pains that may otherwise seem confounding to young people experiencing them for the first time. Instead of adjudicating a painful public spat between Coates and Cornel West, for example, Pinckney places it within a tradition, a long and glorious history of contention within black letters, in which \"everyone accus[es] everyone else of running a con\":\n\nIn later years, [Ralph] Ellison remembered [Richard] Wright as a father figure whom he had quickly outgrown. But Wright's example inspired the young James Baldwin to move to Paris in 1948. Wright was hurt when Baldwin declared his independence from the protest tradition by denouncing Native Son. Baldwin later defended his criticism, arguing in part that Wright's concentration on defining his main character by the force of his circumstances sacrificed that character's humanity. Baldwin's turn would come.\n\nIndeed, as Pinckney points out, LeRoi Jones, in his essay collection \"Home,\" from 1966, \"sneered at Baldwin\" for being popular on the \"white liberal cocktail circuit.\" That LeRoi Jones, even after he became Amiri Baraka, remained popular on the white-liberal cocktail circuit, that Baldwin also sometimes sacrificed a character's humanity for a force of circumstance-into these weeds Pinckney does not go, recognizing instead that this Oedipal battle between fathers and forefathers is practically a black intellectual's rite of passage. He is not interested in separating good black from bad, nor in discovering who is the \"realest.\" His focus is black history itself, its twists, its turns, its triumphs and self-negations.\n\nFor Pinckney, separatism in particular is an old song come round again, although this time appearing mainly as \"a rhetorical strategy of the tradition,\" divorced from the kind of black-focussed organization and political interventions represented by the Panthers or, much earlier, in the founding of the historically black colleges and incorporated black towns. In the new language of Twitter militancy, \"we just can't\" with white people anymore . . . and yet here we are and here they are, so what is to be done? As he points out, a despair cannot be total if someone has taken the time to write it out, for even to \"address an audience beyond black people is to be still attempting to communicate and enlighten.\" One recurring pattern in militancy is that one man's militant is another's Uncle Tom:\n\nThe reinvigoration of the marketplace of discussion about that invention, race, has always depended on the passing of the torch, on another generation coming along as a corrective to the one before it, the assumption being that the next generation will be more real and finally tell it like it is.\n\nIf Pinckney is suspicious of this black authenticity contest, it may be because he exists at the intersection of several identities-black, gay, bougie-and so is familiar with how quickly a \"we\" can become a \"you\" and an \"us.\" One of the most striking moments in this book occurs when, while reporting on Hurricane Katrina, Pinckney finds himself in a black New Orleans that seems to welcome him with open arms, which he confesses comes as a surprise to a man who, out of habit and long experience, is used to \"bracing myself for the anti-Tom vibe or the anti-queer vibe.\" He is, that day, not \"you\" but \"we,\" fully included in a black space at a time of black tragedy. Katrina seemed to confirm that what Coates has called \"King's gauzy all-inclusive dream\" of multiracial solidarity had been, as Pinckney puts it, \"replaced by the reality of an America of competing groups, with blacks tired of being the weakest of the lot.\"\n\nStill, within this \"weakest\" group, Pinckney wants us to remember that there is difference and divergence-and plenty of it. Writing about the saga of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the Harvard professor who, in 2009, was arrested on his porch by a Cambridge officer, Pinckney casts an unusually caustic eye over \" The Presumption of Guilt : The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America,\" a book by the Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree, in which Ogletree interviews upper-middle-class black men, many of them Harvard-educated, as they offer similar encounters of mistaken identity. Given that everyone approached for the book is of the privileged class, Pinckney wonders, is the unspoken assumption that the real offense is wounded class pride?\n\nOne quickly understands the irritation of the black working poor with the outrage of black professionals at the social indignities they encounter. There are worse things than not having one's high social status acknowledged by whites. Maybe the point is that no black person should have to stomach any bigotry, but the resentment Ogletree's men . . . express at having been taken for a servant or menial by whites could make one wonder if their parents ever told them that they themselves ought not to judge a black man by the work he was able to find.\n\nWe are prompted to ask ourselves why Gates's tale of high-status humiliation was so much more compelling, at that moment, in America, than the undisguised systemic racism that continued, throughout the Obama years, to support a prison system in which working-class black men were grossly overrepresented.\n\nIn his insistence on such awkward questions, Pinckney proves himself, as one essay title confesses, \"Under the Spell of James Baldwin.\" For Baldwin never tired of being awkward. Pinckney's Baldwin, though, is not quite the Baldwin currently experiencing a surge of popularity: the late Baldwin, the TV-talking-head Baldwin, the celebrity Baldwin selectively quoted in the film \"I Am Not Your Negro.\" Indeed, what Pinckney's several essays on Baldwin reveal is that Baldwin can only be selectively quoted-he espoused so many different, often contradictory, ideas over the years that whichever Baldwin we want is generally the one we tend to get. Pinckney's Baldwin not only did not despair of the possibility of racial coexistence but considered it existentially vital. (\"We, the black and the white, deeply need each other if we are really to become a nation-if we are really, that is, to achieve our identity, our maturity, as men and women. To create a nation has proved to be a hideously difficult task: there is certainly no need now to create two, one black, and one white.\") Pinckney's Baldwin not only implied that white people can be fellow-travellers in the struggle but that it was possible for his own favorite teacher, a white woman, to be structurally yet not actually black:\n\nShe gave me books to read and talked to me about the books, and about the world: about Spain, for example, and Ethiopia, and Italy, and the German Third Reich; and took me to see plays and films, plays and films to which no one else could have dreamed of taking a ten year old boy. . . . It is certainly partly because of her . . . that I never really managed to hate white people-though, God knows, I have often wished to murder more than one or two. . . . From Miss Miller, therefore I began to suspect that white people did not act as they did because they were white but for some other reason, and I began to try to locate and understand the reason. She, too, anyway, was treated like a nigger, especially by the cops, and she had no love for landlords.\n\nAnd of course Baldwin is also the black writer who was so good at appropriation (or assimilation? Or fiction?) that his most famous novel is narrated in the first person by a white man. In place of the consistent black saint we have recently been offered, then, Pinckney gives us back the fabulously inconsistent man and writer, shot through with both self-hatred and self-love, filled with rhetorical fireworks and hot air and pure genius. The Baldwin who, like Pinckney himself, escaped the American struggle for a while-or got a new perspective upon it-by leaving for Europe.\n\nMany go to Paris; Pinckney went to Germany and England. Like for Baldwin, Wright, and Ellison before him, leaving the U.S. brought both exhilaration and anxiety. \"You could still find a sort of prejudice among black people against European expatriatism,\" he writes, \"as if it were only a rung below passing for white\"-again, merely an individual solution to what was a problem for the black masses. But his spell abroad in no way lessened his fascination with the diaspora. Instead, in his European essays, he tracks black lives on unexpected journeys and down strange back alleys.\n\nIt is a delight to follow him. How would I ever have heard of a book like \" A Black Woman's Odyssey Through Russia and Jamaica : The Narrative of Nancy Prince\" if not for Pinckney's digging it up? I never knew the Communist Party worked to support the Scottsboro Boys, nor that \"the cause of freedom for black people mattered to the leading writers of the Romantic movement: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley,\" nor even that \"Greenwich Village was a black neighbourhood when Dickens visited in 1832.\" In his beloved Berlin, while walking through the German Historical Museum, Pinckney finds that \"the chapter on German colonialism occupied a single glass case under some stairs,\" where the fact that the German Army massacred thousands of the Herero and Nama people in the early twentieth century is acknowledged only in a brief piece of text on the wall. In London, he wonders at British racial myopia (\"Britain seemed to tell itself that black people only got to its shores in 1948 with the HMT Empire Windrush. . . . It was as though British people had never asked themselves what happened to the Africans who lived in London or Bristol in the 18th Century\") but also discovers, in the busy migrant streets, a useful corrective to lazy American ideas of Pan-Africanism: \"Nigerians were not Ghanaians, Kenyans were not South Africans, just as someone from Jamaica was not someone from Trinidad.\" (This simple but important point reminds me of a conversation I had about \"Black Panther\" with a Ghanaian friend while we sat at a table full of Americans. Asked what she thought of it, my friend smiled and said, \"Imagine a film featuring a fictional European country in which some people dress like Kenyans, some like Ghanaians, some like Nigerians, some like Ethiopians, and so on, and then everybody has the same 'European' accent, somewhere between Spanish, French, German, and Polish. . . .\")\n\nFor Pinckney, returning to the States means reëntering the world of his parents, and taking up once more his duties as they saw them, though with a new awareness of his own complicated role:\n\nAchievement was self-sacrifice. You must not forget where you came from. You stood on the shoulders of the past. You were one of many. This was serious. You were one of the fortunate and therefore you had a historic destiny to help other black people. My black life was straight; in my white life I could be queer. . . . The connection in my mind between expatriatism and sexual freedom was very strong. It had a lot of fantasy and self-justification in it. . . . To talk about things black at home . . . was a way of not talking about myself while seeming to. I used my being black as a way to hide from my black family.\n\nFew are willing to acknowledge that sometimes the things we declaim most strongly usefully disguise the things we find hardest to admit, even to ourselves. \"What's new in racism\" happens also to be the first subject of conversation each time I am reunited with my own family, and reading the quote above made me wonder: How much intimate and personal information is sidelined and obscured as we discuss what the President said about Africa, or how the Italians are treating their migrants? \"The very serious function of racism . . . is distraction,\" Toni Morrison once said. Can it even distract us from the \"I\" that we are?\n\nLeaving home has its advantages, but also its costs. Considering the case of the Jamaican writer and poet Claude McKay, Pinckney writes, \"His example haunts me. He paid for having been away so long. One day he woke up and discovered that he was out of it and unwanted.\" Pinckney, too, was away a long time, while West and Gates, Jr., established each their own fiefdoms, and while Morrison accepted her Nobel, and now he finds himself back in Harlem, right in the middle of what feels to many-to me!-like a second Renaissance. For Pinckney, it must feel something like the fifth or sixth: \"The culture of the black diaspora has arrived. Again.\" And with it comes a dizzying array of arguments, poses, stances, and claims, some of them surely bewildering to a man who has already lived through so many twists and turns in black history. \"I can't keep up,\" he tells us, \"and often I can't sign on.\" No matter. \"Hotep\" may not be in his vocabulary, but, with his portrait of Farrakhan, he offers an indelible example of one. Besides, we have enough people keeping up with the latest debates and signing on with the hottest hashtags. Those interested in the culture of the black diaspora come to Pinckney's work for other reasons. To know our multifaceted history. To figure out what progress we've made and how far there is to go, though Lord knows consensus on this matter is unlikely. Recently, I noticed that even the lyrics of \"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\"-the so-called black national anthem-are open to interpretation:\n\nWe have come, treading our path thru the blood of the slaughtered, Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; Thou who hast by thy might led us into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray.\n\nHow far is \"thus far\"? Have we ever been in the light? And, come to think of it, are the \"light\" and the \"white gleam\" in those lyrics actual liberations or symbols of a colonized consciousness? Over such disputed territory does black intellectual life rove. No one knows how far we are down the path-we haven't even agreed on the destination. (Kathleen Collins: \"I believe in liberation, but I don't believe it is at all the thing we think it is.\") But that's O.K. We're lifting every voice and singing, often quite different tunes. And how lucky we are to have Darryl Pinckney, who, without rancor, without insult, has, all these years, been taking down our various songs, examining them with love and care, and bringing them back from the past, like a Sankofa bird, for our present examination. These days, Sankofas like Pinckney are rare.

      "text": "What Black History Should Already Have Taught Us About the Fragility of American Democracy\n\nAs the rites of settling the 2020 Presidential election stretched past Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, the weary analysts on cable news began sounding a similar theme. The Presidency would be decided not simply by a handful of swing states but by a small grouping of districts within those states. That responsibility fell largely to Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta-places with disproportionately Black and Democratic voting populations. Two of the four cities, Philadelphia and Atlanta, experienced high-profile shootings of Black men by police in the months leading up to the election; a third, Milwaukee, is just forty miles north of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a third such incident took place. \"Democracy is on the ballot,\" we have heard ceaselessly since the beginning of the Presidential primary season. The nation could not come back, many warned repeatedly, from a second term under Donald Trump . The fact that a congenitally moderate figure such as Joe Biden could draw this conclusion gave ballast to an idea that many people have recognized from the moment that Trump's 2016 campaign began to gather momentum: that he represents an existential threat to the nation's democratic traditions. And, if this is true, it also means that, to a great degree, the future of American democracy hinges on the actions of Black people living in places that this system has consistently failed.\n\nThis year marks the centennial of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment and the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment. Between them, the two acts enshrined the franchise for women and for Black men-an expansion of the compact of democracy that seems even more notable given that, in this election, Black women, a population that required two Constitutional amendments and the Voting Rights Act to gain the franchise, have voted for Biden at a rate of  ninety-one per cent. The Nineteenth Amendment, which came in the midst of  Progressive Era reforms to American society, was the yield of an interracial movement that pushed for suffrage as a fundamental right of citizenship-and its significance has been rightly commemorated this year. But the animating principles of the Fifteenth Amendment have gone comparatively unnoticed. The Amendment was part of an audacious Republican plan to create a new-and, likely, Republican-Black electorate to counterbalance the white, mostly Democratic voting bloc in the South.   In 1860, Southern Democrats, flush with the disproportionate power granted to them by the Electoral College, had torn the Union in half and instigated four years of bloody internecine warfare.  Mindful of this history, in December, 1868, Senator Aaron Cragin, of New Hampshire, and Representative William Kelley, of Pennsylvania, introduced drafts of what eventually became the Fifteenth Amendment. Black voters were meant to be a bulwark against a similar regime arising to again threaten national unity-which is to say that people who had scarcely ever experienced democracy were now among its chief safeguards. The lynching campaigns and terrorism that disenfranchised Black people in the South in the decades that followed weren't only an expression of racism, though they were very much that; they were an attack on the mechanisms that were put in place to inhibit one of the nation's worst habits: a gleeful expression of defiance toward a government that dared try to uphold democracy.\n\nFollow the latest results from the 2020 race .\n\nThe symmetry of the two moments, then and now, is nearly too heavy-handed to be believed. But here we stand, a century and a half later, biting nails and trading Internet memes about which OutKast song best describes the undeterred tide of Black voters in Fulton County, Georgia-part of the late John Lewis's district-who, it had been hoped, would deliver the state to Biden and put the election in the history books. On Tuesday night, in an overt attempt at voter suppression, the President tweeted that the ongoing tallying of votes was a \"fraud\" and an attempt to steal the election from him. The next day, the Administration filed suit to prevent the counting of votes in Michigan and Pennsylvania, a move that echoed the lawsuit filed by Texas Republicans to throw out a hundred and twenty-seven thousand votes in Harris County, Texas, which happens to be among the most ethnically diverse counties in the country.\n\nTwo weeks ago, F.B.I. agents showed up at the homes of Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors, two founders of the Black Lives Matter movement , and informed them that their names were on what appeared to be a hit list that was discovered during the arrest  of a suspected white supremacist in Idaho. Garza tweeted, in response, \"This is why this President is so dangerous. He is stoking fires he has no intention of controlling.\"   Later that week, the journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones noted that antagonism toward the New York Times Magazine's \"1619 Project\"-which she oversaw and which has been widely assailed for asserting that racism is foundational to the United States-had become so intense that she received threats that her and her mother's homes would be burned to the ground. The injustice here is not simply the fact that three Black women were given cause to fear for their safety for having done work intended to further the cause of democracy but that such work falls so disproportionately to them in the first place.\n\nThe parameters of American democracy correlate neatly with the parameters of the nation's racial hypocrisy. This is not a secret; it helps explain why, for instance, a large part of Russian disinformation during the 2016 election sought to exacerbate racial divisions within the country. From the time of the abolitionists, the attempt to point out the fault lines in our democracy-for all our good-has been greeted with violent hostility. But our commitment to democracy was never as unblemished as our national vanity supposed, and our institutions were always more vulnerable to the kinds of corruption that Trump has enacted with astonishing speed. And America's margins have often been the best vantage point from which to survey the weaknesses.\n\nTo be Black in the first week of November, 2020, is to yet again have the feeling of being called off the bench and being told that the whole game is riding on you. Trump is a dangerous man, but he is not nearly as dangerous as the history that animates him. He has retained the allegiance of more than sixty million voters, despite a shattered economy and the deaths of nearly a quarter million American victims of COVID -19. He still has a chance to be reëlected, and Biden's proposition about how much of him democracy can withstand might yet be put to the test. \"Either the United States will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States,\" W. E. B. Du Bois said, in a speech to the Niagara Movement. The enduring value of the history that Black people have amassed is to facilitate the former proposition. But it is particularly hard, this week, to not look around and suspect that ignorance still has more than a puncher's chance at the title.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Florida Demographic That Could Swing the Election\n\nToward the end of the 2016 Presidential campaign, a political canvasser working in the predominantly Black community of Newtown, in Sarasota, Florida, engaged a young man in conversation. \"Why should I register to vote?\" the man said. \"Ain't nothing happened for me in the past eight years.\" Barack Obama's two terms were followed by a historic decline in voter turnout among Black people, and Donald Trump carried Florida by 112,911 votes.\n\nFast-forward to 2020, on a Sunday afternoon in Newtown, where Biden/Harris signs dotted the porches of small cinder-block houses. Five men sat on a bench, their casual demeanor betraying no awareness that they are viewed as a key variable in the election, and are a demographic that Trump is courting, with claims that he's making the criminal-justice system more equitable.\n\nThe men on the bench all served time in prison. One of them, heavyset, with an armful of tattoos, did twenty-nine years. He had voted early, and would say only that he had not voted for Trump: \"The way he talked to people, the way he talked to the news representatives, when he talks to Blacks . . .\" His buddies nodded. \"But, if he loses, it won't be because Biden was better, but because they don't like Trump.\"\n\nConvicted felons in Florida who have completed their sentences can vote, under the state's Amendment 4, but only after five to seven years and the payment of all back fines.\n\nA recent Hill-Harris poll of Florida voters found that thirteen per cent of Black respondents planned to vote for Trump. (In 2016, Trump won only eight per cent of the Black vote in Florida, according to an exit poll conducted by NBC.) The President's gains among Black voters can likely be attributed specifically to Black men. In September, a Nationscape survey of likely voters found that, although at least eighty-seven per cent of Black women planned to vote for Biden, only seventy-six per cent of Black men planned to do so. (According to Gallup, Trump's approval rating among Black men is also eight points higher than it is among Black women.) Jim Messina, who ran President Obama's reëlection campaign, told this magazine, last week, \"If Biden can win Florida early on Election Night, it's over.\"\n\nA few blocks away, a dreadlocked man in his thirties was tidying up a sidewalk café that he owns. He hasn't been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said he wouldn't vote even if he could. He has views, though. \"I like Donald Trump,\" he said. \"He is now pushing people with power out. Like Jeffrey Epstein.\" He didn't elaborate on how he believed Epstein had been brought to justice. He thinks that Trump is being unfairly criticized about his taxes. \"He paid some money, something like seven hundred and fifty dollars,\" he said. \"He was a businessman, and, when you learn about business, you learn about what not to do.\" He went on, \"I mean, the Amazon guy didn't pay nothing, and he made billions.\"\n\nSeveral doors down, another man was working on some electrical wiring at a landmark house. He also has not been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said that, if he could, he wouldn't choose Trump. About the Democratic candidates, he said, \"They should be reversed. Harris on the top.\"\n\nOver at the Salvation Army Center for Worship, a man named John Battle was taking a break from a service. Inside, several dozen other people, mostly former addicts and men who had been incarcerated, sat close together, without masks. Brought up in orphanages, Battle was a football star in high school, but in his twenties he ended up on the streets, and then in prison. Now forty-six, he has been out for only a few months, so he can't vote, either. Among his friends, he said, \"a lot like Donald Trump because he is straightforward. They believe the other guy is about raising taxes and taking away Social Security, and a lot of them are on it, and a lot get disability.\"\n\nAs for the way the government treats Black people, he said, \"They are always putting a 'pause' on things. Even with the stimulus. I got out on May 7th and filed for it, and I was told because I was in prison I can't get it yet. And white guys I know filed in June and July and immediately got their checks. And when I called I was told, 'There is nothing we can do.' \"\n\nEdward James III is a thirty-year-old community organizer and teacher at the Visible Men Academy, a school near Sarasota for Black and Hispanic boys, many with fathers who are incarcerated. He is unhappy that so few of the Black men he talks to are supporting Biden. \"I do understand where people are coming from when they say their lives had not changed under President Obama,\" he said. \"If you've been caught in a cycle of generational poverty and you've never really been anywhere. You're still poor. You're still having run-ins with the police. You're still seeing violence. You're still seeing death. You're still seeing drugs, right?\" He went on, \"If your everyday life is focussed on: How do I keep my lights on? How do I send money to my brother in prison? How do I make sure my daughter is not sexually assaulted by the man down the street? You're not thinking about things at the federal level. I get where they're coming from, but it's very misguided.\"\n\nTrump, he continued, is \"preying on Black people the same way he preys on poor, uneducated white people. He preys on their racism and tries to get them to vote against their own interests. Now, I haven't heard many Black men say they're voting for President Trump, but I will say there's not that much excitement for Biden.\" For some, he said, \"I think he's just flat-out uninspiring. A lot of people put their trust and dreams in Obama, and their lives have not changed.\" He got a dreamy look in his eyes. \"But still-Barack Obama! Once you've had filet mignon, everything else is like chopped liver.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "America Needs More Black Men Leading Its Classrooms\n\nDani McClain\n\nPITTSBURGH- Ron Porter Jr. had a rude awakening during his senior year at Millersville University in central Pennsylvania more than two decades ago. A student-athlete at the central Pennsylvania college, Porter thought that a bachelor's degree in history was all he needed to become a teacher. He hadn't consulted an academic adviser and didn't realize he also needed to take other steps, such as completing classes in education theory and fulfilling student-teaching requirements. It wasn't until a friend and classmate mentioned his own student-teaching plans that Porter realized his mistake.\n\nBy that point, it was too late. Porter, now 46, is hard on himself looking back. \"Dummy, dummy, dummy,\" he said of himself as a younger man. \"No excuse. I could have done it 20 years ago.\"\n\nHe can also do it now-Porter recently received a second chance to pursue his dream profession. He happened to be looking for a way into education at exactly the moment Point Park University, in his native Pittsburgh, was looking for people like him: black men who want to teach.\n\nAmerica's teachers are disproportionally female (75 percent) and white (83 percent), according to recent federal data . Black men make up less than 2 percent of teachers, though minorities now make up a majority of students in public schools.\n\nAnd while they are woefully underrepresented, black men can serve as crucial male role models: They have unique insight into the discrimination that can be experienced by students of color; and, when it comes to understanding the life and educational challenges experienced by many students, black male teachers can offer empathy that is often based on firsthand experience. Data also suggests that students of color are often unfairly penalized when graded by white teachers-but teachers of color don't appear to exhibit this same grading bias against white children. In fact, the tendency of white teachers to grade black and Latino students more harshly could explain up to 22 percent of the achievement gap between white students and students of color, according to a 2008 study . The problem is obvious, but the solution so far has been lacking.\n\nIncreasing teacher diversity is one way to approach this problem. But black men are also especially difficult to recruit and retain in the classroom. Some might be repelled by their own negative experiences at school or believe the job means a string of bad-tempered kids and paltry paychecks. Others lack the financial means and support to make it through college and the teacher training process. Or, like Porter, they are enthusiastic about teaching but need a better understanding of how the certification process works, and mentors who can keep them on track.\n\nIn 2012, Point Park teamed up with three other western Pennsylvania colleges-Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), California University of Pennsylvania, and the Community College of Allegheny County-to increase the number of black males pursuing teacher certification. That year, black men made up just 1 percent of the 1700 students enrolled in education programs at the four colleges; they hoped to increase that to 5 percent within three years. With the help of a grant from the Heinz Foundation, they began hosting recruitment events for high school and community college students, training current teachers and counselors in how to promote teaching as an option to their students, and building a website and social media presence intended to change perceptions of the profession.\n\nThe Pennsylvania effort was one of a spate of similar new initiatives across the country aimed at addressing this national problem, including a South Carolina program that involves two dozen campuses statewide, a New Orleans program based at Southern University, and a districtwide effort in New York City .\n\nThe Pennsylvania schools' program could be particularly helpful because the mismatch in Pittsburgh's public schools is wide. While just over half of the 26,000 students are black and one-third are white, according to data from 2014 , 85 percent of the district's teachers were white and 14 percent were black. Closing this gap was one goal of Bob Millward, the IUP education professor who led the Pennsylvania initiative, and his colleagues.\n\nThey had a second goal as well: Helping prepare black men, who are disproportionately unemployed and underemployed, for stable, middle and upper-middle income jobs in education. While most new teachers start at a salary of around $40,000 in Pittsburgh's public schools, it's a clear path to a steady income. The average salary for a teacher in the district is just over $73,000, and teachers with a dozen years of experience in Allegheny County's school districts earn between $90,000 and $100,000 a year, according to Millward's research. Yet, one of the most enduring myths the project's leaders encountered during their three years hosting recruitment events for prospective undergraduates was the belief that there's no money in teaching.\n\nThis misperception may be one of several reasons why the participating colleges failed to reach their 5 percent enrollment goal. For now, four years later, the four colleges have boosted enrollment of black males in their undergraduate education programs only slightly, to between 1 and 2 percent, said Millward. The Heinz money has dried up, but efforts at IUP continue. Representatives from the school's education department still meet with community college, high school and middle school students to get them thinking about careers in teaching. At Point Park, a 30-percent tuition discount for classroom paraprofessionals, including teacher's aides and day care providers, was launched during the initiative and continues to this day. The funding helps aides attend the Pittsburgh college part-time to pursue an undergraduate education degree.\n\n* * *\n\nPorter was never under the illusion that teaching meant low pay. Growing up, his parents reinforced the idea that being an educator was an esteemed profession. He remembers the pride he felt at the ceremony where his mother was awarded a Ph.D. in psychology in the mid-1970s. She went on to serve for many years as a dean at the University of Pittsburgh. Porter's parents, who both had postsecondary degrees, always told him that upon finishing high school, he had two options: college or the military. His successes on the football field at Pittsburgh's Westinghouse High School helped him secure a scholarship to Millersville. Sports were the carrot that enticed him to study; he needed decent grades to stay eligible to play, he said. Porter recalls being a C student in college but always taking a particular interest in his history classes, the subject he had hoped to teach.\n\nAnd yet, even with his mess-up, Porter found a way into education. Upon graduating, he took a job teaching U.S. history to eighth-grade students at a private school outside Atlanta. He only earned $9 or $10 an hour-far less than the salary and benefits he could have secured as a certified teacher, but stuck with it for a year-and-a-half. From there, his career path took him in a different direction: A friend helped him get a job at IBM. He later went on to work at various nonprofit organizations back in his hometown, at one point helping to connect young men in a fatherhood program with jobs. He also counseled freshmen at the University of Pittsburgh. Then, in 2010, Porter got an opportunity to work as a long-term substitute teacher back at his high school alma mater in Pittsburgh. Eager for the chance to be a role model at an institution that shaped his own life, he took the job.\n\nWestinghouse High School is situated in the city's Homewood neighborhood, a black enclave on Pittsburgh's east side. Head shots of esteemed graduates fill one wall just inside the school's entrance-almost all of them black people who went on to gain recognition in media, politics, and business in the city and nationwide, including jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal and radio talk show host Bev Smith. Porter attended the school in the mid-'80s, when crack cocaine wreaked havoc on many of the community's families. But he remembers those days with pride, citing the football talent that was concentrated on the team.\n\nDespite the noteworthy graduates, the school's reputation has declined in recent years. In 2014, none of the school's students received scores of proficient or advanced on the state's standardized science test. Students at the school are overwhelmingly low-income , with 84 percent eligible to receive a free or reduced lunch. During the 2009-2010 school year, students had no access to advanced math classes or gifted and talented classes, according to data compiled by ProPublica.\n\nThe school has had a revolving door of principals and educational experiments, including a short-lived attempt in 2011 to separate it into two single-sex programs that co-existed in the same building. That same year, the district reorganized Westinghouse from a high school to a combined high- and middle-school program serving students in the sixth through 12 th grades. In Porter's view, the changes haven't helped much. \"It's not a school that parents are lining up to send their kids to, to say the least,\" he said.\n\nBut Porter and others like him could help change that. While a newcomer might be wary of the troubling stats and make unfair assumptions about the students, his roots in Homewood give Porter a greater understanding of what these students are going through.\n\nWhen he started in 2010, his job was to work alternately as a behavior specialist-\"just trying to keep peace in the building\"-as well as a long-term sub teaching history and anthropology to high school students, and reading to 7 th graders. (The history teacher on staff was on leave after getting injured while breaking up a fight.) He fit in with students quickly-he already knew many of them when he arrived, some from his days coaching them in Little League. He also felt familiar enough with the environment to trust his instincts, understanding when to veer from instruction to address something catastrophic that had happened in the community, such as when a student was shot or killed.\n\nPlanning lessons, writing tests, and lecturing reminded Porter that teaching had been his calling years ago. Because he didn't have formal training, he instead employed methods he remembered from his own favorite teachers, asking students to sit quietly, listen, and write down what he wrote on the board. It worked for his students, he said, and he recalls the thrill of seeing his words connect with them. \"You've got their whole attention in the palm of your hand and you just know it,\" he said. He got the same rush helping students understand why Hitler invaded Poland as he did helping coach the school's football team and girls' softball team.\n\nThe neighborhood's youth are close to his heart. He grew up with many of their parents and today lives just five minutes from Homewood, which he said gives him an edge when it comes to discipline and classroom management. \"I can go to some kids, 'Don't make me call your dad, man. Because your dad was over at my house last night.' \"\n\nNow a junior, Maya Alford had Porter as a history teacher her freshman year. She recalls his passion for African American history and his commitment to giving back to the community he came from. While Alford's relationship with her own father is strong, she said Porter had a particularly strong impact on students who lacked close ties with their dads. \"You come to school looking for something you don't have at home,\" she said.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Porter's story shows the influence that black men can have in the classroom, it also illustrates the circuitous path many take to get there.\n\nHarold Grant was a manager in retail before his frustration with that line of work helped him remember how much he'd loved his high school history classes. He began to think about becoming a teacher. But at the time, Grant was in his early 30s and a single father to two young sons, ages 6 and 2. To support his family, he had to work nights at a General Motors plant while working toward his teaching credentials. An eventual stipend from a fellowship program for African American students at the University of Pittsburgh was enormously helpful. Grant went on to teach in Pittsburgh schools for 15 years and is now the parliamentarian and staff representative for Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers.\n\nAbout a year ago, Porter recommitted to earning his full teaching credentials and enrolled in Point Park's master of education program, where he participated in the Pennsylvania consortium's recruitment efforts. He still carries a black backpack that advertises the program (\"Ever Consider Teaching? BlackMenTeaching.org\"). Porter wants a classroom of his own, not another long-term substitute gig. Last summer, he took an introductory course focused on classroom management and lesson planning. \"Taking the class really opened my eyes to what being a good teacher is all about,\" he said. \"Once you identify how different students learn, you're able to adjust how you teach.\"\n\nBut Porter's own education has been on hold this academic year since he learned that his mother, with whom he is close, is ill. \"My head wasn't into it,\" he said of his decision to take a break. His experience shows one of the major challenges of getting more midcareer black men through the certification process (one of the Pennsylvania program's goals): Being older than the average student often means having other responsibilities that vie for your attention.\n\nDespite the latest detour, Porter believes he will someday finish the degree and get a full-time teaching job. The pull of attaining a new kind of security remains strong. \"Having my master's is very, very important to me,\" he said. \"With certification, you're like a made man.\"\n\nFor now, he is continuing his nontraditional teacher training. He no longer works at Westinghouse, and since January has been employed by an alternative school that serves the nearby Penn Hills School District for high school students who have been expelled or temporarily removed from the schools where they're enrolled. Sometimes, they have weapons or drug violations. Sometimes they're involved in the court system. At the Penn Hills school, he's more of a counselor than a teacher: Porter's job is to deescalate situations that threaten to become violent and calm flaring tempers.\n\nOn a recent visit there, it was hard for a newcomer to imagine things getting rowdy. It felt more like a small suite of offices than a high school: There's one open area where the dozen or so students in attendance work independently or one-on-one with teachers, surrounded by smaller classrooms. The students-a mix of teenage boys and girls, all black on the day I visited-finished lunches of tacos, salad, and juice in the large room while Porter met with the school's counselor and principal to discuss various issues that had come up.\n\nAfter lunch, Porter gathered the students for a group session before they headed back into their academic classes, as he does every day. Each student checks in with a high and a low from their lives. Then they have a free-ranging discussion about something that's in the news or some aspect of black history. Sometimes they watch music videos that Porter feels can communicate something meaningful. One student put on Tupac's 1991 hit \"Brenda's Got A Baby,\" about the perils of teenage parenting, and sang along to the lyrics. Porter followed that up with the video to Michael Jackson's \"They Don't Care About Us,\" set in Brazil. One student stared at the screen in awe: \"There's black people in Brazil?\" she asked. \"Yep, they look just like you and me,\" Porter replied.\n\nThe students are quick to explain how Porter's presence enriches their experience and differs from the connection they feel to their teachers, most of whom are white. \"Most of them can't relate to what we've been through,\" one student remarked. \"When Mr. Porter's around, I feel more comfortable,\" another said.\n\nThe cultural disconnect between students and staff may be one major reason that black students are three times as likely as their white peers to be suspended or expelled, according to federal data released in 2014. Porter recalled that on his first day at the alternative school, he watched a black student being written up by a white teacher for calling that teacher bro . In Porter's view, there was nothing offensive or disrespectful about the student's use of the word, but the teacher didn't know that, he said. What may seem a small misunderstanding can have a significant effect on the student's education. An accumulation of write-ups can lead to a suspension or removal to another school-like the alternative one where Porter now works.\n\nPorter's ability to see alternate solutions to problems in education-the wisdom of engaging an agitated student in a conversation rather than immediately writing him up, for example-is precisely what will make him an important addition to the teaching corps, said the school's principal, Ron Graham. Graham is also a black man who also took a nontraditional path into education: He finished his undergraduate degree at 40 and went on to get two master's degrees, all while juggling night school and supporting his young family.\n\nEchoing the encouragement offered by the Pennsylvania program, Graham advises Porter, who has an 8-year-old son, and other middle-age black men considering the education field, to take it slow and avoid becoming so overwhelmed by various responsibilities that they drop out all together. The end goal is too important, he says.\n\n\"It's not just their interaction with the kids, it's their impact on the system,\" Graham said. \"There are also teachable moments for the [nonblack] teachers. The presence of an African American male or any African-American at the table changes the conversation.\"\n\nAs long as they have a seat.\n\nTomorrow's Test is a weeklong series looking at the challenges, tensions, and opportunities as the United States shifts to a majority-minority student population in its public schools-a milestone the country as a whole will reach within the next generation. It is a collaboration with the Teacher Project at Columbia Journalism School, a nonprofit education reporting fellowship.\n\nRead more from Tomorrow's Test.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What It's Like to Be a Black Man Managing an Office of White Women\n\nOn a recent episode of Man Up , Jason Smith, a black ad tech executive, spoke to Aymann Ismail about the difficulties of working in environments where he is the only person of color. Ari Joseph, head of diversity, equity, and inclusion at Vimeo, joined the conversation to discuss \" covering ,\" or downplaying socially stigmatized traits, in the workplace. This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nJason Smith: I remember a young, really smart, white lady that worked at an ad agency that I worked at, had a Midwestern background, really hadn't spent much time with folks that weren't like her. I come in, I'm her boss, and I'm asking her to do some things that maybe challenged her experience. I remember having this really aggressive male reaction, which was like, well, if she doesn't want to do what I ask her to do, or if I feel like-because \"feel\" is important, because I don't know if she has these thoughts-if I feel like she sees me as inferior or she sees me as not being capable of managing her, then I'm going to be really forceful about it: \"This is what I want you to do, this is how I want you to do it, and no questions are asked.\" And I remember walking away from those experiences thinking, Man, this just isn't me. This is exactly how it's not supposed to go.\n\nSo I immediately started to place a practice into how I work with all women regardless of race, and I created a space with this particular person in which they could share with me: How was I behaving? How did they perceive my actions? How did they perceive my management style? And I learned so much about all of these things that she saw about black men and media and the areas that she grew up in and all of these different types of stories that she was told and what she missed or didn't miss at school, and how that really shaped her behavior. It helped me learn a lot about myself and confront some of the things that I brought to work-that in some cases, it may be relevant and I may need to address it that way, but in many other cases, I'm just as guilty of being presumptive. I'm just as guilty of bias, and I think confronting that in an honest and collaborative way not only helped me improve how I think about my work, but I actually genuinely think that it changed someone's life. And we've become the best of friends, and I admire how she works, and I hope I've been a good contribution to what she does in her career as well.\n\nAymann Ismail: That's powerful, man. That's really powerful. But, because we're talking about improving and being a better boss, what direction do you think you might be headed in that you'd rather avoid? What exactly are we trying to improve on here?\n\nSmith: I think the story that I gave you is the mythical perfect one, but that's not always the case. I still am guilty of walking into a room-there aren't any days where this doesn't happen at least once-I'll walk in and I'm absolutely the only person of color in that conversation, and the immediate bias for me is I'm being judged, there's a downgraded perspective on what my capabilities are, and I need to exude some type of extreme confidence. This term that you hear in hip-hop and culture of \"black excellence\"-there's a joke about why in the hell do I have to be excellent all the damn time? I walk in and I have this overexaggeration of puffing up so that I can exude this excellence because of all these preconceived notions from me and what I think other people think about me.\n\nSo what I want to get better at is trying to create spaces and opportunities for me to be more thoughtful and then maybe less presumptive about those conditions always existing. Totally, they may be there sometimes, but I can't go into every scenario thinking that this is a biased condition which I need to be prepared for. I think it's unfair to me, and it's also unfair to people that I'm trying to create a great relationship with. And I think about the responsibility of being a male leader in a female-dominated industry. If I don't create the space to mitigate this anxiety and this fear around being imperfect, I just contribute to the problem. And I think that's just unacceptable.\n\nIsmail: Ari, can you understand where Jason is coming from here?\n\nAri Joseph: One hundred percent, Jason, I feel you, brother. I think your story is a very common one. It brought to mind the concept of \" covering .\" This is a relatively new academic term to describe what we all do in the workplace when we cover part of ourselves. The idea is that there are essentially four domains that we bring to work: appearance, affiliation, association, and advocacy. All of us cover at least a part of who we are in those domains from time to time. The stats are crazy on this: 61 percent of people report covering at work . Full-on 45 percent of straight white men report covering, 83 percent of LGBTQ individuals, 79 percent of black people. So when you're talking about hiding who you are, trying to change your tone, how you approach your interactions-not just with white women, I'm sure with white men too, with Latinos you work with, with the Muslim people you work with-I'm sure in every one of those instances you're adjusting how you present yourself, and that's a very human thing.\n\nIsmail: Wow. I feel really validated by that too, because sometimes I feel like I'm the only one doing it. It's a performance that I have to put on. Like I need to be this particular kind of disarming, friendly, Mr. Rogers-type neighborhood Muslim so that people don't feel threatened by me. But it sometimes feels like I'm just creating that scenario in my head in the first place. Do you have advice for people like us?\n\nJoseph: As the stats describe, everybody for the most part feels this way from time to time, so it's a reality of life. When you're working, when you're a part of a larger group, any group of humans, there are rules. Whether it's a church or a mosque or a community group or school, there are codes of conduct, there are cultural norms, and they're set by the majority. And it just so happens that for most workplaces in America, white men have set the tone for what the culture is going to be.\n\nIsmail: But is covering that bad? As men there is always some kind of performance going on, whether we're performing for our friends or performing for our co-workers. I wonder about how that affects who we think we are. Is it so bad that we're performing at the workplace?\n\nSmith: I will say: absolutely. It's a horrible thing, and the pretending begins even at an early stage. Pretending starts when you fall off your bike and your dad tells you, \"Don't cry.\" That's pretending, because you're hurt and you want to show your emotions. Your job as a man of color is to play it off, player player. That's still pretending. I think that this performance in life as well as in work has hugely detrimental impacts on our mental health and also the way that we engage with our families and our friends and even creating new friendships and relationships that are typically impossible for men because we're trained to have this certain outward presentation.\n\nJoseph: Jason, I hear what you're saying, especially in the personal part of your life. But when it comes to work, the dominant culture sets the rules, and this is just the way humans work. If we want to change that, if we want to make it better for nonmajority people, then we have to get empowered and we have to change the rules ourselves.\n\nI commend you, first and foremost, for making it to where you are in your career-chief business officer is no easy feat anywhere, much less in an industry that is dominated by a demographic that you're not a part of. But you are now in a leadership role. You have the opportunity to influence other stakeholders in the organization. Whether it is your peers, other people with the chief designation, your direct reports, clients, potential recruits. With all of these things, you're setting a tone and you're being an example for other people in your organization. That's the most powerful and important thing that we can do: help each other and help create more inclusive workplace environments, fair workplace environments, for everyone. So if you have that in mind, then you're doing good, man.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Racism Is Stopping Black Men From Solving Our Nursing Shortage\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos by Thinkstock.\n\nChris, a nurse I interviewed recently, is regularly mistaken for hospital housekeeping staff: \"I come [to work] in my white uniform. That's what I wear. Being a black man, I know they won't look at me the same, so I dress the part. I said, 'Good evening, my name's Chris, and I'm going to be your nurse.' She says to me, 'Are you from housekeeping?' \" This wasn't the only time he's had his occupation questioned while he's practicing it: \"I've walked in and had a lady look at me and ask if I'm the janitor.\"\n\nWith a rapidly aging population, longer life spans, and few care facilities in many rural areas, the demand for nurses is high, and the profession has deliberately sought to recruit more men. At the same time, fields that have traditionally been male-dominated-especially manufacturing and construction-have been hit hard over the years, and especially since the 2008 recession. Consequently, some have hoped men would be attracted to nursing given that it is a field that offers stable, well-paying work in a growing industry. Yet nursing still remains predominantly female and white . While many have focused on the barriers to getting men in general to enter nursing, my research shows that black men, who are drastically underrepresented in nursing, may in fact be the group of men most motivated to enter the field, even despite an often racist environment.\n\nFor some men, gendered ideas about work can make entering a field like nursing very difficult. These beliefs persist even when labor market conditions shift so that male-dominated jobs become more scarce. Sociologist Christine Williams' seminal study of men working in female dominated occupations shows immense awareness that they are defying gender expectations. Williams quotes one man whose interest in studying nursing led to his being teased by peers for being gay.\n\nIn a study of unemployed married men and women, sociologist Ofer Sharone finds that this pressure to pursue traditionally male-dominated work even spills over into marriages. \"Unemployed men, but not unemployed women, report marital tensions due to their spouses being critical of the types of jobs that they are pursuing,\" says Sharone. This culture of enforcing gendered boundaries around the profession can explain why persistent ideas about gender and femininity make professions like nursing a hard sell .\n\nBut in a study of black men in nursing, I found that they by and large were unfazed by the perceptions of nursing as a \"woman's job.\" They were aware of the stereotypes about gender and nursing and obviously noted that most of their colleagues in the field were women. But for black men, the gender-based pressures to avoid this professional field were muted by other forces that they found more compelling.\n\nFor one thing, racial and gender discrimination means that higher-status jobs like law, medicine, engineering, and finance that white men may pursue aren't available to them. While even lower status jobs like manufacturing and construction have long been areas where white men could earn comfortable wages doing skilled work, racial discrimination in these fields means that black men often face barriers to their entry, pay, and promotions. In a study of white working-class men employed in the construction industry, for instance, sociologist Kris Paap found that one way these men protect their shrinking \"turf\" is by reinforcing gendered and racial boundaries through social exclusion and even taunting those they don't think belong.\n\nWith blocked routes to skilled work in construction, trade work, or high-status corporate positions, black men see nursing as a relatively welcome alternative. Another black male nurse I interviewed, Leo, told me, \"This is a good job for black men. It makes you work harder mentally as opposed to work in a public setting like construction. It's not like working in the heat, or in a field, bus driving or something. It's a different type of taxing because it works your mind, your heart.\" This helps to explain why sociologist Mignon Duffy finds that black men are a growing number of those present in lower-tier health care work (e.g., home health care aides, nursing assistants, and so forth) relative to men of other racial backgrounds.\n\nIn addition, many of the men in my study were motivated to enter the profession because they believed this field offered opportunities to be of service to black communities. Specifically, they felt that work in the nursing profession offered a way to address the long history of medical racism that has adversely affected black communities, leading to racial health disparities and gaps in treatment, care, and access. Stephen, an orthopedic nurse, told me that poor black patients who have been overlooked in the health care system will benefit from being cared for by someone who looks like them, someone \"who knows the system, to be a change agent for them.\" This motivation to assist minority communities is one most white men who enter nursing likely would not share, which may make black men the most primed to be recruited into the field.\n\nBut their interest in nursing rarely elicited a warm welcome and stories of being confused for housekeeping or socially isolated remain common. Kenny, a nurse in his 50s, described this painful experience as the only black nurse on staff: \"[My co-workers] had nothing to do with me, and they didn't even want me to sit at the same area where they were charting to take a break! [...] When I came and sat down, everybody got up and left.\"\n\nMany black men see nursing as a desirable profession, but the nursing profession hardly welcomes them with open arms. Instead, stereotypes about black men and where they should work come from colleagues and patients, making it difficult for them to enter and advance in this field. Eliminating these barriers to recruit a demographic of men who actually want the opportunities nursing allows, rather than focusing on recruiting men who don't see nursing as a legitimate profession, may be the best way for nursing to meet the U.S. population's needs today-a diverse population whose demands for care we cannot currently meet.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Black, Single, and Waiting\n\nCraig Sjodin/© 2017 American Broadcasting Companies Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nAs a single, heterosexual college-educated black woman in my 30s, I've never thought of myself as a \"bachelorette.\" Even before the female-led spinoff of The Bachelor launched in 2003, and long before the franchise considered casting a black woman as protagonist, in my mind \"bachelorettes\" were white women who were brides-to-be or bridesmaids in their best friends' weddings, throwing parties to celebrate the end of their spinsterhood. Black women were just single and waiting.\n\nThe first time I saw The Bachelor , in 2003 , it was playing in the background of the Tampa, Florida, apartment I had just moved into while I considered the implications a second graduate degree would have on my then nonexistent love life. It would be years before I read the statistics claiming black women are undesirable partners for black men, unwilling to consider interracial partnerships, and therefore unlikely to marry . I had a feeling that the more accomplished I became while remaining single, the more years I let elapse without prioritizing a relationship, the more difficult it would be to find a so-called suitable mate. So I was easily seduced into watching a show about falling in love.\n\nI remember seeing a well-dressed white man with a perfect smile stand next to a bed of radiant red roses, facing a wall of women lined up like pageant queens. The genuine pain of not being chosen was a feeling I recognized, and I turned up the volume in time to hear the rejected women tearfully express their disappointment. I felt at once ambivalent and empathetic. But over the next few weeks, as willing white women in their 20s were whisked away to exotic locations for shared dates with a man they professed to want to marry, I realized how unrealistic the extravagance of love and courtship afforded them felt. To me, the love-at-first-sight storyline came to seem like a white-washed fairy tale. I, like most of my other black female friends, had been single all of my adult life. I didn't even know if I wanted a husband; I just wanted a boyfriend. And so I stopped watching. Black women were not bachelorettes.\n\nThe Bachelor 's fraught relationship to race is a cloud that has hung over the franchise for more than a decade. Season after season, it has introduced black contestants only to swiftly eliminate them, dispatched before they could be fleshed out as memorable characters, lingering in viewers' memories only as cartoonish tropes. The franchise reinforces the patriarchal premise that heterosexual men want to be with women who \"need\" them, and heterosexual women desire men who can \"take care\" of them-a dynamic that is complicated by race and class, and has particular implications for women of color who can take care of themselves or don't have the luxury of waiting to be rescued. The Bachelor doesn't account for women who are intentionally and blissfully single, couples who reject the legalities of marriage, and women of color who are often overlooked because they don't meet cultural whiteness standards. The image of the desirable white woman is one who is polite, quiet, and malleable, while black women are socialized to speak our minds and not take any mess, especially from men. The white bachelorettes and occasional token women of color on The Bachelor were pseudo-sister wives who knowingly shared a man with the expectation that the \"best\" one would win. The scripted dates and scenarios were straight out of romance novels, chick flicks, and Disney movies-historically some of the whitest pop cultural depictions of love imaginable.\n\nThe show has failed to directly respond to mounting criticism about the lack of diversity, instead absorbing the critiques of tokenism, featuring occasional women of color as never-viable options for the white bachelors. The one exception came during the 17 th season of the show, when bachelor Sean Lowe courted six women of color, four of whom were black, and a woman of color-Catherine Giudici is half-Filipina-was chosen as the winner of that season. But it was not until this past season that a black woman, Rachel Lindsay, was a finalist. And now, 15 years after The Bachelor premiered, Rachel Lindsay will star as the franchise's first black protagonist in the new season airing Monday night-surrounded by an entourage of suitors who could have stepped out of a United Colors of Benetton ad. It's hard to know what to feel about this news: whether it's merely a cynical network publicity grab or a form of real progress. Most of all, how will it be possible for a show that has whiteness woven into its very DNA, that has spent so many years caricaturing and diminishing blackness, to convincingly represent black love?\n\n* * *\n\nAfter I tuned out of The Bachelor , I turned to Flavor of Love , which became my respite and guilty pleasure. A blackened spoof of the original ABC show, Flavor of Love implied that romantic black love was only possible in satire. The show featured a \"black\" bachelor-then 46-year-old former 1990s hype man Flavor Flav-who encapsulated the worst stereotypes of black men (lazy, deadbeat, recovered drug addict). The lucky contestants were presented with their emblematic bachelor, a black man with six children by two women who had little apparent intellect or self-restraint. Flavor of Love ghettoized the possibility of black love by encouraging flagrant representations of black women as angry, loud, lascivious, promiscuous, and desperate, erasing the very real desires and fears black women have about finding true love and being chosen. And yet for years, I kept watching, for the simple reason that, as farcical a spectacle as it was, I wanted to see black women try to fall in love.\n\nPaul Hebert\n\nThe whole reality TV-scape of the early 2000s implied that black love was only possible or believable for a black woman if she was a 10 and her beloved was a 1, or vice versa. (The cultural narrative around this conundrum finally shifted when the Obamas became the new Huxtables, but by then the problem was too many Michelles, not enough Baracks.) Helping black women find romance was just not a priority for network television, so over the next decade or so, cable networks filled in the gaps with a few seasonlong shows about black women looking for relationships-unsuccessfully. On VH1, there was Let's Talk About Pep in 2010, which chronicled the dating life of Sandra \"Pep\" Denton, of the hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa, and her middle-age homegirls as they searched for love after failed marriages and successful careers. I Love New York , in 2007, a sequel to Flavor of Love , followed the popular and controversial Tiffany \"New York\" Pollard as she searched for romance after being rejected twice by Flavor Flav. FYI channel's #BlackLove , which ran from 2015 to 2016, featured single, professional black women who, through coaching and counseling, attempted to understand why love eluded them.\n\nOver the past decade, since Flavor of Love went off the air, I have watched everything from Bravo's Real Housewives of Atlanta to VH1's Basketball Wives . These days I am a faithful (though conflicted) viewer of all seasons of Love & Hip Hop . Like its distant cousin Flavor of Love , the series depicts black love through a lens of infidelity and indiscretion (at the expense of black women). But I've been so hungry for TV representations of black love that I keep watching. As a viewer, I've sometimes felt like a female star on one of these shows, a victim of my own low standards-something is better than nothing.\n\n* * *\n\nAs a prospective Bachelorette, Rachel Lindsay could hardly have been more crowd-tested. On the 21 st season of The Bachelor , she was given the first-impression rose by Nick Viall, which, based on previous seasons, often predicted the winner of the show. Her blackness, however, was regularly erased and glossed over. Nick insisted during his one-on-one date with Rachel that his interest in and attraction to her had nothing to do with her race. And while he admitted that he had never pursued a serious relationship with a black woman, the show wanted to tell us that Rachel was different. Rachel transcended race. Her intelligence, professionalism, and humility made it possible for Nick to accept the fact of her race without it being a factor in their courtship. This feint toward colorblindness allowed Rachel's credentials and social class as a lawyer and daughter of a judge to absorb her blackness. As long as she didn't \"act black,\" they didn't have to talk about her \"being black.\"\n\nFor most of the season, it seemed that her race was merely a convenient prop to prove the newfound diversity of the franchise. The other black contestants, whose racial performances were more easily read and interpreted in stereotypical ways, were summarily dismissed. Rachel, meanwhile, was not black until she went home. During the \"hometown\" episode, when Nick met Rachel's family, he was confronted for the first time with her race and the implications it could have on a relationship. At her house, he participated in a traditional black family meal, attended a black church, and had \"a talk\" with a protective black mama. He shared in an awkward confessional that being the only white person at Rachel's all-black church was intimidating. Until then, Rachel's background and demeanor had allowed her to be a bachelorette who happened to be black, not a black bachelorette. It was her family, including her white brother-in-law, who insisted that Nick be prepared for the challenges of marrying a black woman as a white man in the real world. Rachel was eliminated two episodes later.\n\nAs the new season premieres, I have questions. Is being black enough to make Rachel relatable to black women, if the show is determined to peddle a myth of colorblind love? What will it mean for the rest of us if she fails at finding love? What will happen if she succeeds? What if Rachel's performance of blackness, which was digestible and safe during her season on The Bachelor , is made more visible and recognizable when she goes from being around mostly white people to being around more people of color? It is not Rachel's responsibility to be a representative for blackness and black women, but I do think that, as the first black Bachelorette, she will ultimately either rebuff the myths around the unsuitability of black women for love and marriage or reinforce the assumed ratchet respectability of all black women, even those with money and an education. That hometown visit last season was the first promising flicker that the franchise might actually be capable of depicting the single, black female experience with something verging on honesty and nuance.\n\nOn The Bachelor 's live after-show, Rachel met four of her suitors, and we got another early glimpse of how the racial dynamics of the series could shift with a black woman at the center. Host Chris Harrison said: \"You could meet your husband right here, right now.\" Rachel's nervous energy was palpable as the first suitor, a black man named DeMario, walked out with tickets to Vegas and an engagement ring. She seemed genuinely flattered. And then came Blake, a white man who kept demanding hugs and photo ops. Then Dean, another white guy, approached her and said: \"I'm ready to go black and I'll never go back.\" You could sense Rachel's discomfort behind her forced smiles and reluctant hugs. But the fourth suitor immediately seemed to put her at ease. Eric, a black man from Baltimore, broke out in an impromptu dance, and Rachel instinctively joined him. They swayed their hips and flailed their arms to a beat only they could hear while the requisite \"heeeeeeeeeeeeeey\" echoed between them. It was the blackest thing I had ever seen on the Bachelor franchise. They fell into a brief embrace before he walked away, and it low-key looked like black love at first sight.\n\nThe previously composed, racially neutral, respectable Rachel did a black-girl two-step on national television with a black dude from Baltimore?? I smiled at the familiarity of it all. And I decided right then and there that I would tune in to the premiere, if not the whole season. It's hard to say what will happen to The Bachelor 's bread-and-butter demographic of predominantly white, heterosexual women. Will they tune in to watch a black woman dating mostly black men? How will the show manage to perpetuate its fairy tale without glossing over the real complications of interracial dating? It could be that ABC traded one race problem for another. But it's also possible that black women can be bachelorettes-turned-brides after all. I was never invested in the Bachelor franchise because it wasn't a representation of black love, and I didn't see myself in the contestants. Now, I might.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "How the Founder of the Fugees Became a Big-Time Political Donor Without Anyone Knowing\n\nPhoto by Larry Busacca/Getty Images\n\nIt was less than a month before the 2012 election when a spokesman for Black Men Vote, a political group backed by hip-hop musicians including Common and Pras Michel , publicly announced : \"I want a $500,000 donor.\"\n\nThree days later, his wish was all but granted.\n\nThat's when a cool $400,000 landed in the bank account of Black Men Vote, a super PAC whose goal was mobilizing young black men to support President Barack Obama's re-election.\n\nThe source of the money? An obscure limited liability company identified as SPM Holdings LLC with an address in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. By Election Day, SPM Holdings would double down and make an additional six-figure contribution, bringing its total financial support of Black Men Vote to $875,000.\n\nIt was one of the largest donations to a super PAC ever by a limited liability company, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of federal campaign finance records. Moreover, the LLC money represented two-thirds of the $1.3 million Black Men Vote raised in 2012. That's a larger portion of money than any other top-tier super PAC has received from limited liability companies-business entities that can be used to shield the identities of people making large political contributions.\n\nFederal records would eventually show that Pras, a Grammy-winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees, provided $250,000 in seed money for the super PAC's efforts and another $100,000 before Election Day. \"The best way we can make a change is empowering one another,\" Pras told the Center for Public Integrity in a recent interview. \"I put my money where my mouth was.\"\n\nBut the donor (or donors) behind SPM Holdings would remain-until now-a mystery.\n\nThe allure of LLCs\n\nSuper PACs, which were created in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and a related federal court case in 2010, are supposed to be transparent political committees, publicly disclosing who funds them. However, limited liability companies such as SPM Holdings can serve as vehicles for megadonors to contribute to the groups-many of which are aligned with specific political candidates-while hiding their identities from voters.\n\n\"This is an avenue that will appeal to people who want to spend money politically and not necessarily be disclosed,\" said Elizabeth Kingsley , a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who specializes in campaign finance law.\n\nThat's because some states, such as Delaware and Wyoming, don't require LLCs to identify the living, breathing people who own or control them. Instead, they need to provide only the name of a \"registered agent,\" which is often a company that exists only to serve as the registered agents for LLCs.\n\n\"You don't even have to have a human being as a member of certain LLCs,\" said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy , a law professor at Stetson University College of Law. \"It can get quite byzantine very quickly.\"\n\nThe allure of using LLCs to influence politics could become even stronger if the Internal Revenue Service institutes proposed new rules that would require \"social welfare\" nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code to be less politically active. Today, hundreds of millions of dollars in largely untraceable \"dark money\" flow through such groups for political expenditures.\n\nAt least $33 million-and counting\n\nLLCs are already playing politics. Collectively, they've pumped at least $33 million into super PACs since 2010, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of federal campaign finance data. That's only about 2 percent of all of the money that super PACs have raised, but it's been concentrated in contributions to several of the nation's most powerful super PACs. The amount of money may also be higher because super PACs do not always identify an LLC donor as a limited liability company in campaign finance filings.\n\nDemocratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC , for example, has received more than $3.7 million from LLCs since 2010, including $1.65 million last October from the Council for American Job Growth LLC , an offshoot of a pro-immigration reform group founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn a rare move, the Council for American Job Growth itself spent $720,000 last fall on ads boosting Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, rather than donating it to an established political group. It's unclear who funds the Council for American Job Growth.\n\nMeanwhile, two massive Republican super PACs- Restore Our Future and American Crossroads -have amassed more money from LLCs than any others, the Center for Public Integrity's analysis indicates. In most cases the people behind the contributions have been identified, but not always.\n\nRestore Our Future, the main super PAC that supported Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, raised more than $10 million from LLCs-more than any other super PAC. Energy companies Oxbow Carbon LLC and Huron Carbon LLC-two LLCs connected to billionaire William Koch, the lesser-known brother of conservative bankrollers Charles and David Koch-ranked among Restore Our Future's largest donors, giving $2.75 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nRestore Our Future also received a $1 million contribution from a shadowy, Delaware-based outfit called W Spann LLC. That company's gift made headlines after NBC News detailed how this LLC formed, made the seven-figure contribution, and dissolved within a matter of months.\n\nWithin days of the story, campaign watchdogs filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and Department of Justice accusing W Spann LLC of simply being a conduit for someone to make a political contribution-and for also failing to register as a political action committee.\n\nEd Conard, a former official at private equity firm Bain Capital who had close ties to Romney, ultimately came forward as the mystery man behind W Spann LLC. Conard insisted he acted legally. But he also asked Restore Our Future to amend its campaign finance report to name him, not his company, as the donor.\n\nTo this day, Paul S. Ryan, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center -one of the watchdog groups that filed complaints against W Spann LLC-argues that Conard broke the law by using an LLC to \"hide\" his identity. Limited liability companies, Ryan said, cannot be used to \"simply launder funds.\"\n\nDelaware, where paper trails dead-end\n\nLike W Spann LLC, SPM Holdings LLC-the entity that helped bankroll Black Men Vote-is also difficult to unpack. First, state business registration records don't show any company named \"SPM Holdings LLC\" in Florida, where federal election records say it's located. Florida real estate records, however, do show a company named \"SPM 2012 Holdings LLC\" at the same Florida address that the Black Men Vote super PAC listed for SPM Holdings LLC in its campaign finance filing.\n\nSPM 2012 Holdings LLC is likewise not registered in Florida. Instead, it's officially registered in Delaware, where records list only a registered agent: Dover, Delaware-based Registered Agent Solutions Inc., a for-profit company that boasts of being \"an innovative leader in the registered agent and transactional service industry.\"\n\nAn employee of Registered Agent Solutions Inc. said it was the company's policy not to give out client information. \"There is no public information that I can provide,\" she added.\n\nBack in Florida, a business and financial consulting firm called Cruden Bay Partners LLC also shares the same address as SPM 2012 Holdings LLC. But even some people there said they were unfamiliar with it.\n\nOne Cruden Bay employee told the Center for Public Integrity \"there's no SPM here,\" and said, \"you might have the wrong number,\" before hanging up the telephone. Reached via email, Lawrence Rovin, a lawyer who owns Cruden Bay Partners, wrote: \"I am not at liberty to provide you with any information regarding SPM 2012 Holdings, LLC.\"\n\nWho is SPM Holdings?\n\nBlack Men Vote ultimately spent nearly $850,000 during the fall of 2012 on radio ads in Virginia and Ohio that supported the president's re-election. Obama handily carried black voters in both battleground states.\n\nExit polls showed that black voters made up a larger share of the vote in the Buckeye State than they had four years earlier, increasing from 11 percent of all voters in 2008 to 15 percent in 2012. In Virginia, 1 out of every 5 voters during both elections was black.\n\nIt's hard to definitively say how large a role Black Men Vote played in either state, but officials with the super PAC say they were pleased with their efforts.\n\n\"We know that we were a part of the equation,\" said Jeff Johnson , a former BET host and the spokesman for Black Men Vote who made the $500,000 fundraising appeal two years ago.\n\nPras, too, said he believes the group was successful. And as it turns out, he actually gave more money than the federal filings themselves indicated.\n\nThe former Fugees star confirmed that SPM Holdings LLC-which is officially called SPM 2012 Holdings LLC-was his, adding that it was \"just a holding company to do my everyday business through.\"\n\nThis acknowledgment means that Pras provided $1.2 million in total to Black Men Vote, or more than 90 percent of its receipts.\n\nWilliam Kirk , the founder and treasurer of Black Men Vote, said he was grateful for the resources provided by Pras and the super PAC's other supporters. \"Hopefully people will see Black Men Vote as an example,\" he said of the group, which effectively ceased operations after the 2012 election.\n\nKirk was talking about using a super PAC to reach a specific demographic, such as the 18-to-34-year-olds targeted by Black Men Vote. But others could draw a different lesson from the group as well: It's a road map for how to opaquely fund a super PAC.\n\nNo consensus for new rules\n\nWhile the major LLC donor behind Black Men Vote has now-more than two years after the 2012 election-voluntarily revealed his identity, federal law does not require this disclosure. And ideological divisions on the Federal Election Commission, the nation's top campaign regulator, may sink any proposal that would try to do so. Even as the Citizens United ruling has reshaped the nation's political landscape, new rules for LLCs haven't been discussed.\n\nIndividuals have long been allowed to use LLCs to make donations to federal candidates-but contribution records must show both the name of the LLC and the name of the person, or people, responsible for the money. That's to ensure that individuals don't exceed campaign contribution limits and that candidates don't receive corporate money.\n\nNeither of those regulatory rationales apply to the world of super PACs, as these political committees may accept contributions of unlimited size, including money from corporations. But activists in some states, such as New York , are currently pushing to change how contributions from LLCs to state politicians are treated.\n\nThe FEC's three Republican commissioners, who are often at odds with their three Democratic-leaning counterparts, declined to comment for this story.\n\nDavid Mason , a former Republican FEC chairman, said it's \"pointless\" to create additional reporting requirements for LLCs that give money to super PACs, because \"anybody who didn't want that information disclosed would simply do the exact same activity through a corporation.\"\n\nBut at least two of the commission's Democratic members don't see it that way. \"It is another situation where we have a failure to require important disclosure that the public's entitled to have,\" said Ann Ravel , the Democrat who currently serves as the commission's chairwoman.\n\nHer sentiments were echoed by fellow Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub , who stressed that super PACs are supposed to be transparent.\n\n\"If you don't know who's behind it,\" Weintraub said, \"then you don't know what you don't know. Could be a foreign citizen. Could be a foreign government. Could be anybody.\"\n\nThis story is from The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

Instead, Lee began \" Father Figure ,\" a study of black men in positive relationships with their children, as a personal journey. A decade ago, Lee discovered his biological father was a black man with whom his mother had a brief relationship. Lee was raised in Germany by his Korean mother and her husband, a man Lee assumed was his biological father, and who was also extremely abusive. Once Lee learned the truth about his biological father, he felt pain and rejection from the man he never met. For Lee, that pain reinforced the stereotype of the absent black father.\n\nAs a photographer, Lee had focused primarily on street photography, but he began working on \"Father Figure\" after he was encouraged during a photography workshop to try to tackle a long-form project. He did, and recently turned the work into a book, due to be released by Ceiba Foto this September.\n\nLee found the fathers profiled in the series through friends and social media. Sometimes he was introduced to fathers by their children, other times mothers who connected to his story invited him to photograph different fathers.\n\nZun Lee\n\nZun Lee\n\nZun Lee\n\nBuilding relationships and trust with the families is paramount to Lee's work. He sometimes spends weeks or even months with the families to help build trust, to bond with them, and to get an idea of their patterns and habits. Even once he starts shooting, there is still a back and forth between his role as photographer and friend. \"I have to insert myself into a situation so that by the time [I begin shooting] they're used to me,\" Lee said. \"I can't just focus on the photography: I help with the dishes, then shoot a little, help make dinner, then shoot a little bit more ... you have to help out and that's fair.\"\n\nIt is often difficult for Lee to see fathers who show love and affection for their children, since those moments were absent from his upbringing. So when he photographs them, he has to push through those feelings to get the work done.\n\n\"It can be confusing,\" Lee said about seeing the relationships. \"If it's something I find puzzling, I pull out my camera and start shooting and try to make sense of it later.\" Many of the fathers are aware of Lee's background and sensitive to him, often giving him a heads up if they feel they might be doing something with their kids that would be difficult for Lee to see.\n\nThe work has also evolved into something bigger than a personal project. Lee said he is not only trying to shatter the stereotype of black men not being good fathers, but also the idea that black men are people to fear, something Lee said is obviously connected to racial profiling.\n\nZun Lee\n\nZun Lee\n\n\"Basically, the statement I'm making is the reasons people assume black fathers are absent are the same reasons people assume black men are threatening,\" Lee said. \"People say [when looking at his work] 'These are not the men I thought would be affectionate,' and it confuses them to see these men with tattoos and muscles as being nonmenacing.\"\n\n\"I wanted to invite people in, to get curious about what's going on and not hit them over the head with something overly political,\" he added about his work. \"At the same time, the very fact that I'm photographing black fathers in this manner is by its nature very political.\"\n\nLee said he had wanted to shoot the work in color when he first started working on it, but felt black and white helped keep the focus on the fathers. \"I wanted a uniformity with the initial work,\" Lee said. \"I wanted people to focus less on the environment and more on the emotion.\"\n\nSince he began showing the work, Lee said the feedback has been positive with most people sharing their need to see black men portrayed as Lee has shown them.\n\n\"I realized there is a hunger out there for the images.

      "text": "LeBron James' The Shop Is an Unfiltered Glimpse Into the Black Experience in Present-Day America\n\nThe summer of 2018 has proven busy for LeBron James. It started with his decision to leave familiar surroundings to join the Los Angeles Lakers . July saw the grand opening of the I Promise School , a public institution funded jointly by James and his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was courtside for many of his freakishly talented 13-year-old son LeBron James Jr.'s summer-league basketball games. And Tuesday night brought the premiere of James' eight-episode unscripted HBO series, The Shop . The show, produced by James and his longtime friend and business partner Maverick Carter under their Uninterrupted media imprint, rewrites the rules on what a talk show can be. Taking a dive into a number of controversial subjects, it's evident that the King has free rein and will leave no stone unturned.\n\nThe show lovingly seizes the aura and aesthetics of the barbershop , historically a revered safe space and bastion of unbridled camaraderie in the black community. No topic is off-limits within these walls. The shop itself is almost a cast member. It's not just a place to get a shave and a haircut. A barbershop worth its weight in sheen oil can shape-shift into a local news outlet, therapy session, flea market, comedy club, or soapbox during any given day. For the pilot episode of The Shop , LeBron pulls no punches while he discusses the struggles of being a black man in America, even for someone of his stature.\n\nA deliberate casting of black males of varying age, profession, and visibility makes for a powerful half-hour of candid conversation and storytelling. They include heralded young comedian Jerrod Carmichael (whose random, vehement barber-chair lambasting of the Tony-winning, globally lauded stage show Hamilton was a highlight of the premiere), Golden State Warriors forward (and apparent wine enthusiast) Draymond Green, and rap elder statesman Snoop Dogg. Candace Parker of the Los Angeles Sparks also appears to discuss taking a year off from basketball to raise her child. And Jon Stewart holds court as resident Jewish dude and outsider, carefully sliding in and out of discussions and listening intently when it's time to.\n\nBut it's LeBron, who is comfortable venting about constantly juggling his celebrity and complexion and the double standard in the treatment of his Caucasian counterparts, who fuels the narrative. Over the course of the premiere, he fluidly covers a range of topics, from his struggles with going to a mostly white Catholic high school, to why being a devoted, loving dad to his children is paramount, to having to explain to the same children why racist vandals would spray-paint the N-word on his Brentwood home in 2017 .\n\nThere is a specific comfort that LeBron reaps from sharing his experiences with his contemporaries. For a short period of time, a room full of black men with elevated platforms use their visibility to spark dialogue and come to the conclusion that their paychecks don't make them less of a target. New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who signed a new $95 million deal this week, goes as far as likening himself to a \"zoo animal\" in the eyes of his fans. Cathartic and introspective revelations like these leave the door wide open for others to share in kind.\n\nJames often punctuates his poignant anecdotes with profane parlance, a light we haven't seen him in during his dominant NBA career. We get to witness a direct rebuke of \" shut up and dribble \" in its full, uncensored splendor. This is a barbershop, after all. There's no one to stifle your expression. And this only scratches the surface of what a visit could be.\n\nThe moment that rings loudest came from Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Michael Bennett, who quipped that he looked for candor from \"Mike\" when he was growing up. It never came from Michael Jordan. It does from LeBron, his heir on the court but antithesis off of it. Remaining neutral reeks of complicity. So many black kids wish that they could hear their heroes say that they see them. The ability to relate is key. James continues to be outspoken and that intimidates some, including President Trump ( who coincidentally is a Jordan fan ). James is aware of his influence (and the influence of black people as a whole) and is ready to expose the hypocrisy of how he and people who look like him are treated. It's unknown what the rest of this season of The Shop will bring, but the healthy dose of reality in the premiere is welcome-and necessary-in our current climate.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

And how are they seen by others?\n\nLast year, he started looking outward for answers through interviews and photo shoots with fellow young black men.

      "text": "Racism Is Stopping Black Men From Solving Our Nursing Shortage\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos by Thinkstock.\n\nChris, a nurse I interviewed recently, is regularly mistaken for hospital housekeeping staff: \"I come [to work] in my white uniform. That's what I wear. Being a black man, I know they won't look at me the same, so I dress the part. I said, 'Good evening, my name's Chris, and I'm going to be your nurse.' She says to me, 'Are you from housekeeping?' \" This wasn't the only time he's had his occupation questioned while he's practicing it: \"I've walked in and had a lady look at me and ask if I'm the janitor.\"\n\nWith a rapidly aging population, longer life spans, and few care facilities in many rural areas, the demand for nurses is high, and the profession has deliberately sought to recruit more men. At the same time, fields that have traditionally been male-dominated-especially manufacturing and construction-have been hit hard over the years, and especially since the 2008 recession. Consequently, some have hoped men would be attracted to nursing given that it is a field that offers stable, well-paying work in a growing industry. Yet nursing still remains predominantly female and white . While many have focused on the barriers to getting men in general to enter nursing, my research shows that black men, who are drastically underrepresented in nursing, may in fact be the group of men most motivated to enter the field, even despite an often racist environment.\n\nFor some men, gendered ideas about work can make entering a field like nursing very difficult. These beliefs persist even when labor market conditions shift so that male-dominated jobs become more scarce. Sociologist Christine Williams' seminal study of men working in female dominated occupations shows immense awareness that they are defying gender expectations. Williams quotes one man whose interest in studying nursing led to his being teased by peers for being gay.\n\nIn a study of unemployed married men and women, sociologist Ofer Sharone finds that this pressure to pursue traditionally male-dominated work even spills over into marriages. \"Unemployed men, but not unemployed women, report marital tensions due to their spouses being critical of the types of jobs that they are pursuing,\" says Sharone. This culture of enforcing gendered boundaries around the profession can explain why persistent ideas about gender and femininity make professions like nursing a hard sell .\n\nBut in a study of black men in nursing, I found that they by and large were unfazed by the perceptions of nursing as a \"woman's job.\" They were aware of the stereotypes about gender and nursing and obviously noted that most of their colleagues in the field were women. But for black men, the gender-based pressures to avoid this professional field were muted by other forces that they found more compelling.\n\nFor one thing, racial and gender discrimination means that higher-status jobs like law, medicine, engineering, and finance that white men may pursue aren't available to them. While even lower status jobs like manufacturing and construction have long been areas where white men could earn comfortable wages doing skilled work, racial discrimination in these fields means that black men often face barriers to their entry, pay, and promotions. In a study of white working-class men employed in the construction industry, for instance, sociologist Kris Paap found that one way these men protect their shrinking \"turf\" is by reinforcing gendered and racial boundaries through social exclusion and even taunting those they don't think belong.\n\nWith blocked routes to skilled work in construction, trade work, or high-status corporate positions, black men see nursing as a relatively welcome alternative. Another black male nurse I interviewed, Leo, told me, \"This is a good job for black men. It makes you work harder mentally as opposed to work in a public setting like construction. It's not like working in the heat, or in a field, bus driving or something. It's a different type of taxing because it works your mind, your heart.\" This helps to explain why sociologist Mignon Duffy finds that black men are a growing number of those present in lower-tier health care work (e.g., home health care aides, nursing assistants, and so forth) relative to men of other racial backgrounds.\n\nIn addition, many of the men in my study were motivated to enter the profession because they believed this field offered opportunities to be of service to black communities. Specifically, they felt that work in the nursing profession offered a way to address the long history of medical racism that has adversely affected black communities, leading to racial health disparities and gaps in treatment, care, and access. Stephen, an orthopedic nurse, told me that poor black patients who have been overlooked in the health care system will benefit from being cared for by someone who looks like them, someone \"who knows the system, to be a change agent for them.\" This motivation to assist minority communities is one most white men who enter nursing likely would not share, which may make black men the most primed to be recruited into the field.\n\nBut their interest in nursing rarely elicited a warm welcome and stories of being confused for housekeeping or socially isolated remain common. Kenny, a nurse in his 50s, described this painful experience as the only black nurse on staff: \"[My co-workers] had nothing to do with me, and they didn't even want me to sit at the same area where they were charting to take a break! [...] When I came and sat down, everybody got up and left.\"\n\nMany black men see nursing as a desirable profession, but the nursing profession hardly welcomes them with open arms. Instead, stereotypes about black men and where they should work come from colleagues and patients, making it difficult for them to enter and advance in this field. Eliminating these barriers to recruit a demographic of men who actually want the opportunities nursing allows, rather than focusing on recruiting men who don't see nursing as a legitimate profession, may be the best way for nursing to meet the U.S. population's needs today-a diverse population whose demands for care we cannot currently meet.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Debunking the most pervasive myth about black fatherhood\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby German Lopez\n\nThere's a very pervasive myth about black fathers: that they're more often than not absent from their children's lives. But if you look at the data, it turns out the truth is far more complicated than the ugly stereotype suggests.\n\nNew York Times columnist Charles Blow previously took on this myth. Blow started with the basis for much of the idea: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that showed 71.5 percent of black, non-Hispanic children in 2013 were born to unmarried women, compared with 29.3 percent of white, non-Hispanic children.\n\nBut as Josh Levs pointed out in his new book All In , 2.5 million of 4.2 million black fathers - or about 59.5 percent - live with their children. Levs's numbers suggest that it's not true, as the CDC figures suggests, that 71.5 percent of black dads are absent from their homes - but rather that many of them are simply unmarried.\n\nAnd when black fathers do live with their children, they're just as, if not more, likely to be involved in their kids' everyday lives. Blow cited CDC data that showed black fathers are more likely than their white and Hispanic counterparts to feed, eat with, bathe, diaper, dress, play with, and read to their children on a daily basis. While some of the differences in the data aren't statistically significant, the figures indicate that black dads are at least as likely to remain involved in their children's lives as those of other races.\n\nStill, the same CDC data shows black men are nearly three times as likely as white men to have at least one child they don't live with - but Blow pointed to policy-driven issues that may be driving the disparity. For example, a previous report by Justin Wolfers, David Leonhardt, and Kevin Quealy for the New York Times found there are 100 black women not in jail or prison for every 83 non-incarcerated black men. So mass incarceration has actually drained 1.5 million black men - many of whom are young and of marrying age - from their communities, making it more difficult for black women to find committed partners of the same race.\n\nAll of the data paints a more nuanced view of black fatherhood than the stereotypes suggest. It's not an issue of laziness, inability to commit to family, or another inherent flaw in black culture, as some people may suggest. There are real systemic issues at play - and most black fathers do seem to be trying make the future bright for their kids.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nAfter receiving the Oscar for Best Song for \"Glory\" from Selma, John Legend gave an impassioned speech calling out the present-day state of affairs for African Americans. One line stood out: \"We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than there were under slavery in 1850.\"\n\nIt's become a widely cited statistic, after the publication of Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow in 2011 - which helped make mass incarceration a hot topic of discussion. But is it true? Yes, the basic numbers check out - although the stat is a little misleading.\n\nThe key to this is the term \"correctional control\" - which doesn't just refer to prisons, but to jails (for people who haven't been convicted yet, or are serving short local sentences); parole (for people who've been released from prison but are still being supervised); and probation (supervision as an alternative to a prison sentence). In all, as of a 2009 report from the Pew Public Safety Performance Project, one in every 31 Americans is under one of these four types of \"control.\"\n\nSo while there are fewer black men physically in prison today than there were in slavery in 1850, the addition of probation and parole brings it over the top.\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\nThe totals: 1.68 million black men are under correctional control in the US, not counting jails. That's over three times as many black men as were enslaved in 1850.\n\nHere's why this is a bit misleading: there are more black men (and more people, generally) in the US now than there were a century and a half ago. In 1850, there were 3.6 million African Americans in the US (men and women), according to the Census; in 2010, there were 42 million. So a much larger share of the black male population was enslaved in 1850 than is under correctional control today.\n\nThat doesn't keep the statistic Legend offered from being true, or alarming. What's even more alarming is the number of other statistics he could have offered to show the impact that mass incarceration has had on black men over the past few decades. One example: a black child whose father didn't complete high school has a 50 percent chance of seeing him incarcerated by the time she's 14.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n24 percent of black men approve of Trump. Just 6 percent of black women do. Why?\n\nby Jane Coaston\n\nAs a general rule, black Americans do not support Donald Trump. According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll , Trump enjoys just a 14 percent approval with black Americans, while roughly eight in 10 black voters say they're \"uncomfortable\" with his 2020 run for reelection. In a poll of roughly 800 black registered voters conducted by BlackPAC, Trump had a -59 percent net job approval rating.\n\nBut within those numbers is another story - a stark gender divide.\n\nRoughly 24 percent of black men polled by WSJ/NBC approve of Trump's efforts while in office (72 percent of black men disapprove), but that number plummets to 6 percent when black women are asked the same question.\n\nExit polling from the 2016 election shows that while 13 percent of black men voted for Donald Trump, just 4 percent of black women did (in Pennsylvania, that number dropped to 1 percent). For comparison's sake, a majority of white men and white women voted for Trump, as did 32 percent of Latino men and 25 percent of Latino women. And this \"black gender gap\" isn't new. Exit polls for 2008 and 2012 show that more black women voted for Barack Obama than did black men. In fact, the last time more than 10 percent of black women voted for a Republican presidential candidate was 1996 , when 14 percent of black women voted for Bob Dole (to compare, 22 percent of black men did the same).\n\nSo why is the gender divide between black women and black men so stark when it comes to presidential politics? It's a complex question, one that Nadia E. Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University and co-editor of Distinct Identities: Minority Women in US Politics , told me has been largely under-studied. Instead, she said scholars had tended to respond with mild curiosity: \"It's more of a, 'Hmm, how interesting.'\"\n\nThe \"black gender gap\" in presidential politics will play a role in determining the race for the White House in 2020. Yet the reasoning for the gap - and moreover, why black women vote the way they do - remains largely unexamined.\n\nThis gender divide, as unstudied as it may be, is still obvious. And the Trump reelection campaign seems to be leaning into it.\n\nThey are focused on appealing to black voters in 2020, hoping to surpass the 8 percent marker set by Trump in 2016. The campaign is planning to open field offices aimed at attracting black voters in 15 cities, including five in Florida. Even Trump's State of the Union address was interpreted by some conservative outlets as a bid for black votes.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson told me that the campaign's focus on the economy and purported support for criminal justice reform would win over black voters.\n\n\"Black Voices for Trump will engage black communities to share President Trump's record of success and promises kept during his first term in office,\" Pierson said in a statement. \"Black unemployment has hit an all-time low thanks to his policies, he has dedicated more money to Historically Black Colleges and Universities than any previous president, and he has advanced criminal justice reform more than any of his predecessors, giving thousands of incarcerated people a second chance.\"\n\n(It's worth noting that according to polling conducted by Axios, only 22 percent of black Americans think their personal financial situation has improved since 2017, and Trump and members of his administration alike have praised practices that disproportionately hurt minority communities like stop and frisk and lambasted activists for police reform .)\n\nBut hidden within that full-throated effort to win over black voters is a notable recognition that such attempts are aimed largely at black men, as black women are viewed as largely unattainable votes for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nTo be clear, black men vote for Democratic presidential candidates by wide margins, and dislike Trump by wide margins. But in a race likely to be determined by small margins, every vote - and every decision to vote for a different candidate - matters, particularly when 78 percent of college-educated black men voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 while 91 percent of college-educated black women did the same.\n\nIn a piece for the conservative outlet the Federalist titled \"Why Trump's gains with black voters could swing the 2020 election,\" policy analyst Stewart J. Lawrence noted:\n\nHow much support can Trump actually gain in 2020? It's not clear. But it's important to note African American men are far more likely than women to gravitate toward Trump. Past voting numbers bear this out. In 2016, Trump earned 11 percent support from African American men compared to just 4 percent from women. African American women seem to retain a deep underlying hostility toward Republicans generally, and white male Republicans like Trump especially. That may not change.\n\nI emailed Lawrence, who told me he'd like to see \"focus group research and/or in-depth interviews with African American women to form a real opinion\" on why black women don't vote for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nBut he did offer his thoughts on why black men might be more supportive of the president. \"Trump is a genuinely 'aspirational' figure for some African American men - in fact, quite a few, higher than has been reported, I think,\" he said. \"I did quite a few informal interviews before the 2016 election and [was] surprised to see how far this went - but perhaps less surprising against a female Democratic candidate.\"\n\n\"Trump's business success, his 'gangsta' personal style, and his close association with black male celebrities as well as some of his policies (America First, staying out of foreign wars and investing at home) [have] created a real affinity.\"\n\nRashawn Ray, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Maryland who has written extensively on how black men vote, told me, \"Black men, particularly the 16 percent of college-educated black men who voted for Trump in 2016, are driven by their views about the economy, business growth, and religion. Some black men think that more progressive Democratic candidates are too liberal and they might simply not trust other candidates.\" He added that those men weren't impacted by the \"same concerns\" as a majority of black women.\n\nIn a piece for the Atlantic in 2016, Johnson and Leah Rigueur, an assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, wrote that black Trump supporters are like to be \"likely to be a working-class or lower-middle-class black man, over the age of 35, and interested in alternative approaches to addressing what ails black America,\" adding, \"these voters tend to be more receptive to core messages of self-determination, financial success as a function of hard work, and personal responsibility, especially when conveyed in a plainspoken, hypermasculine manner.\"\n\nBrown agreed when we spoke, telling me, \"My take on this is that there are things in the GOP ideology that black men find appealing. The conservative ethos of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, asserting patriarchy and male dominance, all of these kinds of traditional gender values, some black men find [them] very appealing.\" And Karen Finney, a CNN political commentator and political consultant said, \"It may be that the disparity relates to an effort to appeal to - for lack of a better word - machismo, portraying Trump as a tough guy, which may resonate more with some black men and not black women who may worry more about the divisiveness.\"\n\nI spoke to Ugonna Eze, a conservative black law student at the University of Chicago who plans to vote for Trump in 2020. \"While I don't appreciate some of his tweets or rhetoric,\" he told me, \"I think the president correctly assessed the challenges posed by China's economic misbehavior, America's protracted engagements in the Middle East, and the problems that came with lax enforcement of our immigration laws.\"\n\nBut black women are, as a group, highly entrepreneurial , making up one of the fastest-growing segments of new business owners in America. And black women, despite \"less traditional\" views on gender roles compared to black men and white women and men, are not uniformly liberal . Meaning that logically, the appeal of the \"conservative ethos\" would apply to black women as well as black men, leading them to vote for conservative candidates or, alternatively, not vote at all .\n\nBut it doesn't. Not only do black women vote overwhelmingly for Democratic presidential candidates, they are also one of the most consistent voting groups in the nation, voting at higher rates than any other group in 2012 and casting their ballots in numbers 6 points above the national average in 2018.\n\nWhy?\n\nLawrence put his reasoning for why black men might be more supportive of Trump succinctly: \"Because they're men. On this aspect alone, race has nothing to do with it.\" And it's true: There's a big gender gap in support for Trump that's observable across racial categories, with women of all races 19 points less favorable towards the president than men. But again, 52 percent of white women voted for Trump in 2016, as did 25 percent of Latino women, compared to 4 percent of black women.\n\nJane Junn, a professor of political science and gender and sexuality studies at USC, told me the reason for the black gender gap was simple: \"African American women understand that they have nowhere to go other than Democratic candidates,\" even if they've got to \"hold their nose\" to do so.\n\nShe told me, \"There is no uncertainty about where the Republican Party stands relative to the Democratic Party on gender issues, on women's equality issues, nor is there much misunderstanding about where the Democratic Party stands relative to the Republican Party in terms of race.\" She added that while black men, being men, stood to gain from the \"reinforcement of patriarchal structures\" that is encouraged, in her view, by the GOP, black women did not.\n\n\"It's not like everybody has the same amount of choice,\" she said. \"A white man can really choose [to vote for] anybody he wants. He can decide what his ideology is. He can decide what his positions on issues are. But for women of color, they don't really have anywhere to go. They have the same right to vote for Trump, but they're never going there because he still explicitly represents and positions himself against many of the things that women of color will benefit from.\"\n\nShelley Wynter, a radio host in Atlanta who told me he began supporting Trump in September 2015 and has \"been on the train ever since,\" told me that the black gender gap is \"not only with the presidency.\"\n\n\"There's also a gap in a lot of things, particularly in the black community,\" he said. There's \"the gap that exists with the whole Me Too movement, there's a gap that exists in the whole world of accusations proving guilt. There's a tremendous gap among males and females around many issues, and I think Trump's just one of those issues.\"\n\nHe added that in his view, the Democratic Party had enjoyed a \"lock\" on the votes of black women for decades, so \"the gap [between black women and men] was already there in turnout and now you see it vis-à-vis a specific person.\" And Wynter referenced allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against Trump - \"Let's just add to the fact that there's been a narrative surrounding Trump about women and the treatment of women. That exists also; that causes it also.\"\n\nNina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and national co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, told me, \"Black women aren't interested in Trump for the same reason that all black people aren't interested in Trump - his policies and rhetoric are openly hostile to our interests.\"\n\nNadia E. Brown said during our conversation that in general, black Americans are \"socially conservative but fiscally liberal,\" and for black women, fiscal policies that impact health care or raising children are ones they deal with on a daily basis. Even if socially conservative ideologies are \"what people hold in their hearts and practice in their homes,\" she argued that many black women see themselves as having a \"linked fate,\" a common outcome with other black women, and might be unwilling to vote for policies that could harm others in their communities.\n\nBrown argued that black women tend to be \"community caretakers,\" and their politics is shaped by the view that \"even if I'm a financially well-to-do person, I'm still thinking about others in my community.\" According to polling conducted by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, 80 percent of black mothers are the primary earner in their family, while also taking on caregiving duties and enduring a greater likelihood of encountering poverty than every racial group except Native American women.\n\nShe said that \"black men don't have that same set of ethos,\" using the example of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who portrayed his sister as helplessly dependent on welfare when in fact she had worked two jobs while Thomas was in law school and only began using welfare benefits when she stopped working to care for an elderly aunt recovering from a stroke. For some black men, Brown said, \"they don't see the sacrifices others are making for them as sacrifices.\"\n\nIt's important to recognize the incredible diversity within and among black women. Prior to the 1970s, black women were reliable Republican voters , and polling data can often obscure black women who do, in fact, vote for Republican presidential candidates, including President Trump. But the vast majority don't.\n\nAnd while the Trump campaign is focused on black voters (a majority of whom believe Trump's actions are \"very bad\" for black Americans), that focus is primarily on black men . Black women are believed to be, in some sense, a \"lost cause\" for Republicans. And that's a bad thing, particularly for black women themselves, who are often treated as \"saviors\" who will ride to the rescue of liberal voters once again. Their needs, their priorities, and their values taken for granted, again.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Jenée Desmond-Harris\n\n\"There are more black men in jail than in college.\"\n\nIvory A. Toldson - Howard University professor, senior research analyst for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and deputy director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs - called this, in a 2013 column for the Root , \"the most frequently quoted statistic about black men in the United States.\"\n\nIt's also dead wrong.\n\nIn 2002, the Justice Policy Institute, a national nonprofit dedicated to reducing incarceration, released a report titled \" Cellblocks or Classrooms : The Funding of Higher Education and Corrections and its Impact on African American Men.\"\n\nOne of its key sobering findings was this: \" Nearly a third more African-American men are incarcerated than in higher education .\"\n\nThe statistic almost instantly became a talking point. It was often deployed by those who wanted to explain just how dire racial disparities in the United States were, and how desperately the situation facing black men needed attention and intervention.\n\nEven Barack Obama has mentioned it. At a 2007 NAACP forum that he attended as a presidential candidate, he told the crowd, \"We have more work to do when more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities across America.\"\n\nThe stat was also repeated by those who wanted to anchor their arguments that that African American communities - and black men in particular - suffered from a dangerous cultural pathology.\n\nIn 2012, former NBA player Charles Barkley, explaining why he felt he had to carry a gun , said, \"You know, we as black people always, we don't have respect for one another. You know, we've got more black men in prison than we do in college, and crime in our neighborhoods is running rampant.\"\n\nThe Census estimates that approximately 18,508,926 people in the U.S. population are black males, of all ages. In 2013, 1,437,363 were in college, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Prisoner Statistics Program reports that in that same year, 526,000 were in state or federal prisons, and, as of mid-year 2013, 219,660 were in local jails, making for a total of about 745,000 behind bars. The millions of black men not included in those numbers, of course, have already finished college, already served a prison sentence, have a life trajectory that does not involve college or prison, or are too young for either to apply.\n\nAccording to Toldson, the 2002 \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom\" report that provided the basis of \"more black men in prison than in college\" was based on data that was was likely incomplete at the time, and has definitely become outdated since.\n\n\"I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used [for the \"Cellblocks of Classrooms\" report] and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then,\" he told NPR in 2013. \"And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time.\"\n\nThat's right. The number of black men in college used in the report wasn't actually the number of black men in college. It was the number of black men at schools that chose to report this data - a much smaller figure.\n\nPlus, things have changed. Thanks to a variety of factors including the popularity of for-profit colleges, the raw numbers show that enrollment of black males in college increased from 693,044 in 2001 to 1,437,363 in 2013.\n\nNumbers aside, the college vs. prison comparison is problematic on its face. Men (of all races) can be incarcerated at any point in their lives for any length of time, while enrollment in college typically happens during a narrow age range and a short timespan. So contrasting the two experiences is an apples-to-oranges exercise that doesn't tell us much about what's happening with any population.\n\nWhile the scary statistic was probably handy for creating some drama around the plight of black men (and it's true - there are far too many in prison), it's not accurate, and probably never was.\n\nRepeating this false statement does far more harm than good. As Toldson said, \"[W]e will not sufficiently support black male college students - nor college-bound students - if we simply keep perpetuating the myth that juxtaposes their needs with those of black males in the criminal-justice system.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nNothing will cure you of perfectionism faster than trying to grow living things.\n\n3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nHow a day off can (and can't) help children.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "3 theories why Democrats have lost support among Black men\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's an erosion that's taken place over the last decade.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nFor years, Black men have been an integral part of the Democratic coalition.\n\nIn 2012, 87 percent of Black men backed former President Barack Obama; in 2016, 82 percent backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and in 2020, 79 percent backed President Joe Biden , according to NBC exit polls . This year, 70 percent have said they're backing Vice President Kamala Harris, per a recent New York Times/Siena poll .\n\nAs those numbers make clear, the group overwhelmingly supports Democrats, but their loyalty has begun to wane, a shift that stretches across the last several campaigns. That attrition has something to do with the candidates themselves, but also with voters' longstanding disillusionment with the party. Despite being one of Democrats' most loyal voting blocs, some Black voters have felt ignored and taken for granted as campaign promises and change have been slow to materialize.\n\n\"People are disappointed with the Democrats,\" says David Childs, a history professor and director of the Black Studies Program at Northern Kentucky University. \"A lot of people feel disenfranchised. They don't feel like they have a voice.\"\n\nAn added twist is some evidence that the Democrats' leftward shift on social issues may also be a factor. Reviewing polling on respondents' views on LGBTQ issues, Thomas Edsall of the New York Times noted that views expressed by Black voters in one survey suggested that \"some aspects of Democratic liberal orthodoxy contribute to the exodus of conservative minorities from the party.\"\n\nThe erosion Democrats have seen could be attributed to any number of reasons. But broadly, here are three theories that can explain why some Black men are feeling cool toward the party this cycle:\n\nIn the last four years, Black Americans have faced the same economic challenges as everyone else, while also navigating racial wealth and wage gaps that mean many Black families feel the effects of rising costs and inflation more keenly than their white counterparts.\n\nWhile Black unemployment reached an all-time low during the Biden administration, it's still twice as high as white unemployment . Similarly, while the Black poverty rate reached a record low in 2022 , that all-time low still meant nearly one in five Black Americans was living in poverty, nearly double the poverty rate of white Americans .\n\n\"In focus groups and conversations with party leaders, Black men have stated repeatedly that their material conditions have remained unchanged under Democratic and Republican presidential administrations,\" the New York Times's Maya King reports . And as costs have risen during the Biden administration - mostly due to inflation - that feeling of stagnation has only grown more pronounced.\n\nSuch sentiments have prompted some voters to weigh whether voting for an alternative option - like Trump - could help produce a different outcome.\n\n\"Nothing has come to fruition. Look at the schools, the playgrounds, the parks. Downtown is struggling. In our community, typically, we vote for Democrats. How has that panned out for us?\" Ahmad Taylor, an undecided Michigan voter who previously voted for Biden, told the Washington Post's Michael Brice-Saddler.\n\nMultiple Covid-19 aid packages also helped stem the economic pain some voters experienced because of the pandemic during the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration. These included stimulus checks, small business funding, and expansions to unemployment payments.\n\nA number of these payments, however, expired during the Biden administration because Republicans in Congress balked at passing a continuation of programs like an expanded child tax. That's left voters dealing with both higher costs on consumer goods and a drop-off in aid that could help soften the blow.\n\nBecause the first wave of stimulus checks was sent out during the Trump administration and also bore his name , some voters have been under the mistaken impression that he's solely to credit for them. That idea has taken hold even though the aid was passed by a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, and even though stimulus payments were distributed during the Biden administration as well.\n\nAnother dynamic at play is more conservative attitudes among some Black voters on social issues. In particular, as Democrats have shifted leftward on LGBTQ rights - just over a decade ago, Obama was hesitant to back same-sex marriage - some of these voters have chafed at the party's current stance.\n\nThis cycle, Republicans have ramped up attacks on LGBTQ rights, particularly those targeting trans people , and that may be resonating with certain voters , including Black men . In one attack ad on Harris that played during football games, the Trump campaign has gone after her support for funding gender-affirming surgeries for trans inmates - something, it should be noted, that prisons also offered under Trump . \"Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you,\" the ad states.\n\nCharlamagne Tha God, an influential media personality and one of the hosts of the syndicated radio show The Breakfast Club , has described the ad as \"effective.\"\n\nOther voters have spoken of Democrats' support for gay rights as a problem. \"That's when I left Democrats alone,\" one voter, identified as J, told NPR , noting that the legalization of same-sex marriage, a milestone made possible by the Supreme Court but celebrated by Democrats, was his tipping point away from the party.\n\nThose socially conservative viewpoints can extend to gender as well. When it comes to Harris's candidacy, specifically, sexism might well be a real issue for some voters, including Black men.\n\n\"There are traditional values that come out of a lot of the Black homes that are still around,\" Childs says. \"Even though many Black males were raised by a mother, by a matriarch, there's still this notion that women have a certain place in our society.\"\n\nCliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, notes that he's heard the sentiment from a small percentage of voters he's spoken to. \"You got some percentage that will come out and tell you, like in your face: 'I don't think a woman should be president,'\" he says.\n\nA problem that only amplifies Democrats' struggles is the rise of disinformation, multiple experts posited.\n\nChilds notes that influencers on the right have seized on real concerns Black men may have - like economic frustration - to advance false messages about how Harris and Biden haven't accomplished anything to help members of this group.\n\nIn one example that Charlamagne Tha God cited during a town hall with Harris this week, he referenced a viral clip from a Harris interview with the Grio that was taken out of context and has been cut so it looks like she's saying she won't do anything specifically for Black people.\n\nThese claims often begin with pundits on the right, or even Trump himself, and get amplified over social media by celebrities, podcasters, and other prominent personalities. The singer Janet Jackson , for instance, recently elevated lies that Trump had told questioning Harris's ethnicity.\n\nMultiple surveys, including an August NAACP poll , have found a stark generational divide among Black men, with voters under 50 far less likely to support Harris than those over 50. Albright believes this points to the effect disinformation on social media has had, as younger voters are more likely to get news from these sources.\n\n\"It's like a living organism, this disinformation. It grows from a cell, and then it reaches the point where it takes on a life of its own, and it just grows all kinds of tentacles,\" Albright tells Vox. \"And ... it's touching millions of Black voters.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Why?\n\nby Jane Coaston\n\nAs a general rule, black Americans do not support Donald Trump. According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll , Trump enjoys just a 14 percent approval with black Americans, while roughly eight in 10 black voters say they're \"uncomfortable\" with his 2020 run for reelection. In a poll of roughly 800 black registered voters conducted by BlackPAC, Trump had a -59 percent net job approval rating.\n\nBut within those numbers is another story - a stark gender divide.\n\nRoughly 24 percent of black men polled by WSJ/NBC approve of Trump's efforts while in office (72 percent of black men disapprove), but that number plummets to 6 percent when black women are asked the same question.\n\nExit polling from the 2016 election shows that while 13 percent of black men voted for Donald Trump, just 4 percent of black women did (in Pennsylvania, that number dropped to 1 percent). For comparison's sake, a majority of white men and white women voted for Trump, as did 32 percent of Latino men and 25 percent of Latino women. And this \"black gender gap\" isn't new. Exit polls for 2008 and 2012 show that more black women voted for Barack Obama than did black men. In fact, the last time more than 10 percent of black women voted for a Republican presidential candidate was 1996 , when 14 percent of black women voted for Bob Dole (to compare, 22 percent of black men did the same).\n\nSo why is the gender divide between black women and black men so stark when it comes to presidential politics? It's a complex question, one that Nadia E. Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University and co-editor of Distinct Identities: Minority Women in US Politics , told me has been largely under-studied. Instead, she said scholars had tended to respond with mild curiosity: \"It's more of a, 'Hmm, how interesting.'\"\n\nThe \"black gender gap\" in presidential politics will play a role in determining the race for the White House in 2020. Yet the reasoning for the gap - and moreover, why black women vote the way they do - remains largely unexamined.\n\nThis gender divide, as unstudied as it may be, is still obvious. And the Trump reelection campaign seems to be leaning into it.\n\nThey are focused on appealing to black voters in 2020, hoping to surpass the 8 percent marker set by Trump in 2016. The campaign is planning to open field offices aimed at attracting black voters in 15 cities, including five in Florida. Even Trump's State of the Union address was interpreted by some conservative outlets as a bid for black votes.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson told me that the campaign's focus on the economy and purported support for criminal justice reform would win over black voters.\n\n\"Black Voices for Trump will engage black communities to share President Trump's record of success and promises kept during his first term in office,\" Pierson said in a statement. \"Black unemployment has hit an all-time low thanks to his policies, he has dedicated more money to Historically Black Colleges and Universities than any previous president, and he has advanced criminal justice reform more than any of his predecessors, giving thousands of incarcerated people a second chance.\"\n\n(It's worth noting that according to polling conducted by Axios, only 22 percent of black Americans think their personal financial situation has improved since 2017, and Trump and members of his administration alike have praised practices that disproportionately hurt minority communities like stop and frisk and lambasted activists for police reform .)\n\nBut hidden within that full-throated effort to win over black voters is a notable recognition that such attempts are aimed largely at black men, as black women are viewed as largely unattainable votes for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nTo be clear, black men vote for Democratic presidential candidates by wide margins, and dislike Trump by wide margins. But in a race likely to be determined by small margins, every vote - and every decision to vote for a different candidate - matters, particularly when 78 percent of college-educated black men voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 while 91 percent of college-educated black women did the same.\n\nIn a piece for the conservative outlet the Federalist titled \"Why Trump's gains with black voters could swing the 2020 election,\" policy analyst Stewart J. Lawrence noted:\n\nHow much support can Trump actually gain in 2020? It's not clear. But it's important to note African American men are far more likely than women to gravitate toward Trump. Past voting numbers bear this out. In 2016, Trump earned 11 percent support from African American men compared to just 4 percent from women. African American women seem to retain a deep underlying hostility toward Republicans generally, and white male Republicans like Trump especially. That may not change.\n\nI emailed Lawrence, who told me he'd like to see \"focus group research and/or in-depth interviews with African American women to form a real opinion\" on why black women don't vote for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nBut he did offer his thoughts on why black men might be more supportive of the president. \"Trump is a genuinely 'aspirational' figure for some African American men - in fact, quite a few, higher than has been reported, I think,\" he said. \"I did quite a few informal interviews before the 2016 election and [was] surprised to see how far this went - but perhaps less surprising against a female Democratic candidate.\"\n\n\"Trump's business success, his 'gangsta' personal style, and his close association with black male celebrities as well as some of his policies (America First, staying out of foreign wars and investing at home) [have] created a real affinity.\"\n\nRashawn Ray, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Maryland who has written extensively on how black men vote, told me, \"Black men, particularly the 16 percent of college-educated black men who voted for Trump in 2016, are driven by their views about the economy, business growth, and religion. Some black men think that more progressive Democratic candidates are too liberal and they might simply not trust other candidates.\" He added that those men weren't impacted by the \"same concerns\" as a majority of black women.\n\nIn a piece for the Atlantic in 2016, Johnson and Leah Rigueur, an assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, wrote that black Trump supporters are like to be \"likely to be a working-class or lower-middle-class black man, over the age of 35, and interested in alternative approaches to addressing what ails black America,\" adding, \"these voters tend to be more receptive to core messages of self-determination, financial success as a function of hard work, and personal responsibility, especially when conveyed in a plainspoken, hypermasculine manner.\"\n\nBrown agreed when we spoke, telling me, \"My take on this is that there are things in the GOP ideology that black men find appealing. The conservative ethos of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, asserting patriarchy and male dominance, all of these kinds of traditional gender values, some black men find [them] very appealing.\" And Karen Finney, a CNN political commentator and political consultant said, \"It may be that the disparity relates to an effort to appeal to - for lack of a better word - machismo, portraying Trump as a tough guy, which may resonate more with some black men and not black women who may worry more about the divisiveness.\"\n\nI spoke to Ugonna Eze, a conservative black law student at the University of Chicago who plans to vote for Trump in 2020. \"While I don't appreciate some of his tweets or rhetoric,\" he told me, \"I think the president correctly assessed the challenges posed by China's economic misbehavior, America's protracted engagements in the Middle East, and the problems that came with lax enforcement of our immigration laws.\"\n\nBut black women are, as a group, highly entrepreneurial , making up one of the fastest-growing segments of new business owners in America. And black women, despite \"less traditional\" views on gender roles compared to black men and white women and men, are not uniformly liberal . Meaning that logically, the appeal of the \"conservative ethos\" would apply to black women as well as black men, leading them to vote for conservative candidates or, alternatively, not vote at all .\n\nBut it doesn't. Not only do black women vote overwhelmingly for Democratic presidential candidates, they are also one of the most consistent voting groups in the nation, voting at higher rates than any other group in 2012 and casting their ballots in numbers 6 points above the national average in 2018.\n\nWhy?\n\nLawrence put his reasoning for why black men might be more supportive of Trump succinctly: \"Because they're men. On this aspect alone, race has nothing to do with it.\" And it's true: There's a big gender gap in support for Trump that's observable across racial categories, with women of all races 19 points less favorable towards the president than men. But again, 52 percent of white women voted for Trump in 2016, as did 25 percent of Latino women, compared to 4 percent of black women.\n\nJane Junn, a professor of political science and gender and sexuality studies at USC, told me the reason for the black gender gap was simple: \"African American women understand that they have nowhere to go other than Democratic candidates,\" even if they've got to \"hold their nose\" to do so.\n\nShe told me, \"There is no uncertainty about where the Republican Party stands relative to the Democratic Party on gender issues, on women's equality issues, nor is there much misunderstanding about where the Democratic Party stands relative to the Republican Party in terms of race.\" She added that while black men, being men, stood to gain from the \"reinforcement of patriarchal structures\" that is encouraged, in her view, by the GOP, black women did not.\n\n\"It's not like everybody has the same amount of choice,\" she said. \"A white man can really choose [to vote for] anybody he wants. He can decide what his ideology is. He can decide what his positions on issues are. But for women of color, they don't really have anywhere to go. They have the same right to vote for Trump, but they're never going there because he still explicitly represents and positions himself against many of the things that women of color will benefit from.\"\n\nShelley Wynter, a radio host in Atlanta who told me he began supporting Trump in September 2015 and has \"been on the train ever since,\" told me that the black gender gap is \"not only with the presidency.\"\n\n\"There's also a gap in a lot of things, particularly in the black community,\" he said. There's \"the gap that exists with the whole Me Too movement, there's a gap that exists in the whole world of accusations proving guilt. There's a tremendous gap among males and females around many issues, and I think Trump's just one of those issues.\"\n\nHe added that in his view, the Democratic Party had enjoyed a \"lock\" on the votes of black women for decades, so \"the gap [between black women and men] was already there in turnout and now you see it vis-à-vis a specific person.\" And Wynter referenced allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against Trump - \"Let's just add to the fact that there's been a narrative surrounding Trump about women and the treatment of women. That exists also; that causes it also.\"\n\nNina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and national co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, told me, \"Black women aren't interested in Trump for the same reason that all black people aren't interested in Trump - his policies and rhetoric are openly hostile to our interests.\"\n\nNadia E. Brown said during our conversation that in general, black Americans are \"socially conservative but fiscally liberal,\" and for black women, fiscal policies that impact health care or raising children are ones they deal with on a daily basis. Even if socially conservative ideologies are \"what people hold in their hearts and practice in their homes,\" she argued that many black women see themselves as having a \"linked fate,\" a common outcome with other black women, and might be unwilling to vote for policies that could harm others in their communities.\n\nBrown argued that black women tend to be \"community caretakers,\" and their politics is shaped by the view that \"even if I'm a financially well-to-do person, I'm still thinking about others in my community.\" According to polling conducted by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, 80 percent of black mothers are the primary earner in their family, while also taking on caregiving duties and enduring a greater likelihood of encountering poverty than every racial group except Native American women.\n\nShe said that \"black men don't have that same set of ethos,\" using the example of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who portrayed his sister as helplessly dependent on welfare when in fact she had worked two jobs while Thomas was in law school and only began using welfare benefits when she stopped working to care for an elderly aunt recovering from a stroke. For some black men, Brown said, \"they don't see the sacrifices others are making for them as sacrifices.\"\n\nIt's important to recognize the incredible diversity within and among black women. Prior to the 1970s, black women were reliable Republican voters , and polling data can often obscure black women who do, in fact, vote for Republican presidential candidates, including President Trump. But the vast majority don't.\n\nAnd while the Trump campaign is focused on black voters (a majority of whom believe Trump's actions are \"very bad\" for black Americans), that focus is primarily on black men . Black women are believed to be, in some sense, a \"lost cause\" for Republicans. And that's a bad thing, particularly for black women themselves, who are often treated as \"saviors\" who will ride to the rescue of liberal voters once again. Their needs, their priorities, and their values taken for granted, again.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nStories of \"Living While Black\" were a reminder of how public spaces are still controlled along racial lines.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nIn 2018, news headlines were dominated by stories that followed a similar pattern: a black person is minding their own business in a public space when they are approached by a white person, who questions their right to be there.\n\nSometimes, the white person skips the middle part and anonymously calls the police.\n\nFrom using a phone in a hotel lobby , trying to cash a check at a bank , to babysitting white children , mowing lawns , selling water , eating at Subway , sleeping in a college common room, and entering their own apartment buildings , this past year has brought us countless stories of black men, women, and children who were trying to go about their daily lives only to be interrupted by a stranger challenging their presence, challenges that often culminated in interaction with the police.\n\nBeing racially profiled for \" Living While Black \" is not exactly a new phenomenon. But the wave of coverage these types of incidents received this year was unprecedented.\n\nNational politics - along with a rise in reported hate crimes and a resurgence of white supremacist movements - has emboldened white people frustrated by their perceived loss of power to take out their fear and anxiety on communities of color.\n\nThe ubiquity of smartphones has made it easier to record these incidents than ever before, and the resulting media coverage revealed how much black life in America remains subject to close scrutiny and suspicion.\n\nEight months ago, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson entered a Philadelphia Starbucks to meet with a business partner. Minutes later, after a manager called 911 and told a dispatcher that there were \"two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave,\" they were surrounded by police .\n\nThe two men, both black, were put in handcuffs, and a video of their arrest went viral. They were quickly released from custody, but the fact that they were ever detained sparked national outrage.\n\nThe same month that Nelson and Robinson were arrested, a Pennsylvania golf club owner called the police on a group of black women, supposedly for golfing too slowly . Several teens shopping for prom at a Missouri Nordstrom Rack were accused of shoplifting . Two months later, a white family called the police on a black child for mowing part of the wrong yard .\n\nThese stories, and others like them, are part of a bigger story involving the ways that public spaces are controlled along racial lines. They are also a reminder that decades after the collapse of legal segregation, spaces like clothing stores, coffee shops, and universities are often still thought of as either \"black spaces\" or \"white spaces.\"\n\n\"These incidents have always happened, but white people do not always believe it because it doesn't happen to us,\" Robin DiAngelo, a sociologist and the author of White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism , told me this year . \"The only real difference we have now is that we are able to record it in a way that makes it undeniable.\"\n\nAmerica has a very long history of restricting black movement , going back to the years of black codes and Jim Crow laws. And while the Living While Black incidents of this year certainly built off of that history, they're also a thoroughly modern development, one that Yale sociologist Elijah Anderson describes as \"a powerful new form of symbolic racism that targets black people for behaving in ordinary ways while being black at the same time.\"\n\nAnderson explained this in further detail in an August article for Vox , noting that much of the issue lies in white Americans' belief that African Americans cannot be separated from what he calls the \"iconic ghetto\" - a place where blacks live inferior lives separate from whites.\n\nAnderson writes:\n\nIn practical terms, whites know little about the iconic ghetto and the people who inhabit it. But despite that lack of specified knowledge, for many whites, the anonymous black person in public is always implicitly associated with the urban ghetto.\n\nThe link to the ghetto is so strong that it becomes the \"master status\" of the typical black person, to use a term coined by sociologist E.C. Hughes. It's the feature that most defines black people in the white imagination.\n\nAnonymous black people - wherever they may actually live, and whatever their profession - therefore move about civil society with a deficit of credibility in comparison with their white counterparts, who are given a \"pass\" as decent and law-abiding citizens.\n\nIn this system, the average black person wages a constant campaign for respect, which is lost before it begins. The judges are most often the contestants who compete with black people for place and position in our increasingly pluralistic and thus rivalrous society.\n\nBut the problems highlighted by Living While Black incidents are not solely about the ways public space is controlled. These incidents have also called attention to the ways that police are often wielded as a weapon against people of color to force compliance and exert control. And given very clear racial disparities in police use of force, this weaponization has been particularly concerning.\n\nIn the aftermath of several prominent Living While Black incidents this year, black people said that involving police immediately made them afraid. But the men and women involved also spoke of a broader feeling of dehumanization after having their presence in a place questioned.\n\nPaul Butler, a professor at Georgetown Law and the author of Chokehold: Policing Black Men , told me that this feeling of dehumanization is particularly harmful.\n\n\"When the police are called on African Americans, it has a very negative impact on those black people, even if they are not arrested, or beat up, or killed,\" Butler said. \"You're required to justify your existence and your presence in a white space. It makes you feel like less of a citizen and less of a human being. It's impossible to overstate the adverse consequences.\"\n\nThere were countless stories of Living While Black in 2018, but the headlines that grabbed media attention are only one part of the story. According to an October HuffPost/YouGov poll , 54 percent of African Americans said that they have felt \"others have been suspicious of them based on the color of their skin.\"\n\nJust 6 percent of white people said the same.\n\nThis suggests that the stories of the year are part of a much larger problem when it comes to racism in America. And solving this issue is, of course, complicated. In the short term, consequences for those making unnecessary 911 calls have been limited, and have often been imposed by the public.\n\nWhile individuals making 911 calls have been subjected to online ridicule and nicknames like #BBQBecky and #PoolPatrolPaula, or occasionally fired from their jobs for attracting negative attention, only a few have actually faced legal consequences .\n\nThese stories also highlight how racism has affected all people of color in 2018 - a year in which Latinos were openly threatened with calls to ICE, Arabic speakers were subjected to racist rants for daring to use their language in public, and people carried out hate crimes targeting nonwhite houses of worship. The anger over racial profiling in Living While Black stories is inseparable from the story of Botham Jean being killed in his own home , and is connected to the outrage over a black boy being forced to cut his hair before a wrestling match.\n\nWhile the circumstances of each incident may differ, they all highlight the ways in which people of color are singled out and treated as deviant, often at the cost of their dignity, or their very lives. For black Americans, the incidents that unfolded this year were a reminder that while progress has been made, black bodies in America are still too often viewed as potentially criminal and deserving suspicion.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nWhen the US government banned prisoners from participating in medical research back in 1978, it was trying to protect their health. But the move may have inadvertently skewed decades of medical research - particularly research into racial inequalities in health.\n\nA new study in Health Affairs by Yale's Emily Wang suggests that some of the biggest medical studies of the last few decades may have seriously distorted data on African-American men. That's because they were conducted during a period in which a disproportionate number of black male high-school dropouts were in prison. The paper casts doubt on studies examining everything from cardiovascular health to bone marrow - but since the overwhelming majority of studies don't publish their protocols, there's no telling how many studies have been compromised.\n\nNow, medical researchers want to change the rules, so that the racial disparities in incarceration don't continue to skew health research.\n\nPrisoners are ideal subjects for medical research in many ways. It's difficult for them to say no - particularly for money - and they tend to stick around for the duration of the study.\n\nin the mid-20th century, 90 percent of new drugs were tested on prisoners first\n\nBut those qualities can also make prisoners vulnerable to unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies looking to try out new drugs on human subjects. In the mid-20th century, about 90 percent of all pharmaceutical products that went to market got tested on inmates first.\n\nThe system was ripe for abuse. In the early 1970s, reports came out about prisoners who had been exposed to radioactive chemicals or hallucinogens. In the most famous case, in Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, one test made a participant's skin change color - in an experiment he'd never signed a consent form to participate in.\n\nIn 1978, the federal government shut down the prison-testing industry by outlawing all federal research on inmates that wasn't explicitly tied to the effects of incarceration itself, or to conditions that disproportionately affect prisoners (like Hepatitis C), unless the researcher could prove that the research would be beneficial to the inmate.\n\nWhat's more, if someone who was already enrolled in a long-term health study got sent to prison, he'd have to stop participating in the study - unless the researchers had gotten permission in advance from the federal government to study prisoners.\n\nWHEN A SUBJECT LOST CONTACT, RESEARCHERS DIDN'T KNOW IF HE'D LOST INTEREST OR BEEN SENT TO PRISON\n\nIn the late 1970s, before the incarceration rate skyrocketed, this wasn't likely to be a concern for medical researchers. But the African American men that came of age just after those regulations were passed experienced the beginning of mass incarceration in the United States.\n\nAs a result, some of the most significant medical studies out there, especially on conditions that tend to affect African American men - like heart disease - were affected by a problem they'd never anticipated: when a subject lost contact with the researchers, they had no way of knowing if he'd simply lost interest or been sent to prison.\n\nWang's paper looks at several studies that followed subjects over many years or even decades, and compares the dropout rate for each demographic with how likely the dropouts were to have gone to prison at that point.\n\nincarceration caused 2/3 of all black male dropouts in one cardiovascular health study\n\nWhile results varied, she found that studies that were supposed to examine at-risk populations were the most likely to have their data screwed up by mass incarceration. In one major study examining cardiovascular health among inner-city young adults over 20 years, Wang estimated that 65 percent of the African American men who dropped out of the study were probably locked out.\n\nThis means that the people who were able to stay in the study weren't representative of the black male population as a whole. People who have never been incarcerated are healthier than people who have been, so this is especially problematic for medical research.\n\nAnd if too many subjects are incarcerated, researchers don't have enough data to draw conclusions at all: by the 15th year of the cardiovascular study, there weren't enough African American male subjects left in the study for researchers to analyze racial disparities.\n\nSome experts have been recommending for years that the government change the rules so that, if people start participating in a study under normal circumstances, they don't have to stop when they go to prison.\n\nFor now, there doesn't appear to be much momentum behind the shift. It's only been a few decades since the government stepped in to stop prisoners from being used as guinea pigs, and regulators are wary.\n\nStill, the new Health Affairs study raises the question of whether it's really ethical to force prisoners to stop participation in medical research when they're incarcerated. It's just another realm in which a vast swath of people, mostly African American and Latino men, are getting excluded from American society.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

AD quickly became a fan favorite because she was candid about her destructive choices when it comes to love. \"If I see a red flag, I'm like, 'Oh, well, I'll just paint my nails red to match,'\" AD confessed to the camera early in the season. This tragic admission informed her decision to pair up with Clay, a man who reminded her of her exes and revealed that he selected women solely based on physical appearance. The internet placed Clay in the show's villain category once he probed AD about her looks, a major faux pas for a show titled \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nThroughout the course of their engagement, Clay earned that villain title. Commentators noted how he treated AD like a receptacle for his trauma, even going as far as laying his head on AD's chest to be coddled like a newborn minutes into their reveal. \"I'm a baby,\" he told AD, as they took stock of their physical characteristics, noting that both of them were dark-skinned. Clay talked about his father's infidelity like it was the third partner in their relationship and focused on how AD could build him up. He repeatedly expressed fear about commitment, but AD held his hand through the process. He ultimately managed to shock AD, in front of their parents and other family members and friends, when he said no to marrying her at the altar.\n\nOutside of her relationship with Clay, AD faced additional hurdles during filming. Her castmates drew attention to her body, pointing out how \"stacked\" she is, and made an inside joke (\"bean dip\") about non-consensually smacking her breasts, which, no need to look it up, is in fact sexual assault. Now, a year after filming, AD says that she \"had such an amazing experience\" on Love Is Blind . But her storyline highlights some of the sinister aspects of dating as a Black woman, and because it's airing on Netflix, the reality is being splashed across one of the world's biggest platforms. AD's experience is connected to that of Lauren, Diamond, Iyanna, Raven, Tiffany, and Aaliyah - Black women whose stories came before hers on Love Is Blind - as well as to the Black women whose journeys were never shown, and even those well beyond the show's pods.\n\nTo talk about how this show positions Black women, I reached out to \"meeting and mating\" sociologist Sarah Adeyinka-Skold , an assistant professor at Loyola Marymount University. Adeyinka-Skold studies how \"inequalities are produced and reproduced\" in romantic relationships, and says that Love Is Blind viewers are naive to have ever thought that this experiment, sometimes billed as an equalizer, would help Black women have an easier time finding love. We talk about the unique challenges Black women face, their limited portrayals on the show, the issues with casting, and why Black women's pain seems to be profitable for both Netflix and the show's producers.\n\nWe are now six seasons in on Love Is Blind and I find myself questioning whether Black women should continue to go on this show. Have you been wondering the same thing?\n\nI can honestly see an argument for Black women to not go on the show. What we're seeing is that external constraints like racism and sexism are always in the pods even though the show has tried to create this other reality.\n\nWhy are we treating the representation of Black women so basic?\n\nWhat kinds of portrayals of Black women are allowed on Love Is Blind ?\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the reality they choose to show and how they choose to edit. They're choosing to give us some things and not give us others. They're creating a reality that reinforces these gendered racial stereotypes of Black women as these Jezebels - hypersexual and promiscuous. And as these mammies who are caring.\n\nIn season four, they had these two white nasty women [Irina and Micah ] on the show. That's not behavior we could ever see from Black women on that show! The kind of backlash they would get. And I wouldn't want them to depict Black women that way. But again, there's this humanity and fullness of person, or a spectrum of white womanhood that we get to see, that we don't get to see with Black women.\n\nAll of the Black women on the show are professionals. They're extremely kind. They're extremely smart. But we don't get to see that. We see the producers and editors focus on the problems these women have. Why are we treating the representation of Black women so basic?\n\nBlack women being ignored, disrespected, or rejected on dating shows isn't new. We have so many examples from the Bachelor and Perfect Match to Married at First Sight and Love Island . Black women are either treated as side characters or just not given a chance to shine at all. But it felt like Love Is Blind could somehow equalize dating and create a space for Black women to be seen and celebrated. Do you think this has happened?\n\nI think when people say that, they're being naive about how our social structure is shaped and formed. Anytime anyone says that something is supposed to be the great equalizer, we should side-eye them and ask, \"What does that actually mean?\"\n\nIn this context, that idea shows a lack of understanding of how our society is set up on purpose to put Black women at the bottom of the gender and racial hierarchy. To think that any dating show could be an equalizer for Black women is pretending that that hierarchy doesn't matter.\n\nLet's talk about casting. People have criticized the show for not casting men who are interested in dating Black women.\n\nWe think about romance and love as these agentic, individual things that we do in silos. We're constantly acting as though we are choosing or making decisions outside of our social structure. But the fact of the matter is, this country was built on the rape, pillaging, and conquest of Black women's bodies. It's also built on explicit laws that said you should not be marrying Black people, laws that were on the books until 1967 with the Loving v. Virginia case. So how do we think that that's all just going to disappear? My question is, what do people mean when they say we need to get men that are interested in Black women, and dark-skinned Black women, in particular? Isn't that the antithesis of the show?\n\nIf the whole premise of the show is emotional connection, maybe what they're trying to say is you need to bring people on the show that are really tuned into and attracted to the experiences that Black women have, [who] know for themselves that Black women's stories and the experiences make them great partners. So maybe what we mean is we need to cast men who are intimately familiar with the Black woman experience, and it's part of their attraction to these women.\n\nYes, that is the subtext. Most of the people I've seen making this suggestion are Black women. AD herself is advocating for a better vetting process, and a few seasons ago, former contestant Raven Ross said men in the pods \"weren't looking\" for Black women. So it seems like Black women in the pods have had to do this kind of initial vetting themselves.\n\nThat's why AD asked Matt, \"Do race and ethnicity matter to you?\" She was correctly attuned to the fact that he is white. And when she asked, she was talking about skin color, but the subtext was also, \"I'm coming in with a particular kind of experience that you're not going to get with any other woman precisely because of the way our social structure is set up.\"\n\nWhen you're a shitty man in Black skin, society looks at it differently\n\nLet's break down some of the issues in AD's relationship with Clay and try to make sense of what it all means for Black women who go on this show and for Black women who date on any reality TV show, online, or in real life.\n\nLet me first say that any man of any race can say all of the things that Clay said. But when we think about the cultural imagination about Black men, unfortunately, Clay checks off all of the boxes of what we think about Black men who are good-looking and as egotistical as Clay.\n\nWe can think of it like a Venn diagram. There's the circle of shitty men characteristics, and then another circle for Black men characteristics, and then in the middle you have Clay. So together, Clay is a shitty man who also happens to be Black.\n\nAnd when we think about what a shitty Black man is, he's a guy who cheats. He's a guy who's not ready for commitment. He's a guy who is stuck on the physical. He's a guy who's maybe fine dating non-Black women but doesn't think that Black women should be interested in non-Black men. Like, he's so much cooler. He's a cool Black guy, so how could AD possibly be interested in a guy like Matt?\n\nIn the United States, there are these characteristics that we associate with shitty men, but when you're a shitty man in Black skin, society looks at it differently. Society says, oh my goodness, they are going to ruin your family. They are going to be violent. They are going to be cheaters. It doesn't carry the same type of weight as a shitty man in a different skin tone.\n\nSo unfortunately for Clay because he happens to be a shitty man who's also Black, he's just playing into that cultural imagination, those stereotypes, that we already have of Black men and which we think is the source of Black women and Black families' problems. When you have a society where Black people are at the bottom of the racial hierarchy and Black men are demonized, Clay is seen as particularly bad. Again, I don't think that Clay is doing anything original.\n\nIt feels like Black women are having this conversation among themselves. I don't know that I've seen many men outraged, apart from Wale who's been keeping his foot on Clay's neck on X all season.\n\nThat points back to our racialized and gendered society. Black women are often the ones that have to bear the burden of choosing Black men, of being committed to the racial uplift of Black people, of choosing Black community over themselves.\n\nPeople are always holding Black women to the highest standard. Black women understand that it's on them to keep Blackness afloat. It's on them to breathe the respectability of Blackness. It's on them to show other people we can have Black love and Black families. Black men don't care about this because first of all, they're men. They are rewarded regardless. They don't have to care because the pressure is not on them to keep the race going. The pressure is not on them to choose the community every time. And if they do that, people are like, \"Oh, that's fantastic.\" You get extra points for choosing the community and choosing Black women.\n\nBut Black women don't get extra points. And in fact, they get deducted points, if they do something like date a white guy, which goes outside of the norms. And I think that AD probably didn't even understand how much the experience within a culture that says, \"This is what good Black women do\" also impacts the decisions that she's making. That's why Black women are having this conversation. They recognize that these two things constrain the ways in which they're allowed to be fully human.\n\nWhen there are Black healthy relationships, they're calling it boring\n\nSome would argue that Black women have had some successful relationships on LIB . For example, fans view season one's Lauren and Cameron as the show's golden couple. And then we have Tiffany and Brett, who are celebrated for being the show's first Black couple that has remained together.\n\nI like the contrast with Tiffany and Brett. They did a good job in season four of giving us a successful story. It was just really beautiful and I'm glad that they did that. But I also think it shouldn't be an anomaly. It shouldn't be that in these other seasons we're kind of treating Black women like trash. We need to see the full experience of Black women just like we see the full experience of white women on the show.\n\nI've seen white commentators call Tiffany and Brett boring, while others have complained that they don't get enough attention from the franchise.\n\nWhen you say it's boring, what are you looking for? Are you looking for that drama that you guys focused on in season five? Is that the only thing we're capable of watching? These are the same groups of people who will tell us that the Black family is in shambles because all the men are like Clay. But y'all want to watch that shit on television . You guys will tell us Black families are poor because the women are too much in charge. But y'all want to watch that shit on television. So when there are Black healthy relationships, they're calling it boring. That should make you question what it is you want to watch and why. Why do you want to see Black people as stereotypically dysfunctional? So Black people can't win.\n\nThough AD and Clay say they're not dating, viewers are speculating that they are still together based on their body language during certain moments of the reunion. But if some months from now they do announce that they are giving it another go, how should we interpret their decision?\n\nI think we need to understand that AD and Clay are navigating some pretty complicated structural and agentic constraints as they are trying to find love. As we have discussed, no white woman on the show was like, \"What do you think about race?\" They have never asked that question. I will die on that hill.\n\nAD and Clay are still navigating gender and race in a way that white people simply will never have to. And so we need to extend to them the full grace that we give to humans because they are humans.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Study: people see black men as larger and more threatening than similarly sized white men\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nResearchers found this time and time again in a series of seven studies.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nThere are two men. They have nearly identical bodies, with close to the same height and weight. Which one is larger? Which one is more threatening? Which one could do more harm to you?\n\nMost people would probably think to answer \"neither,\" since both men are the same size.\n\nBut according to a new series of studies published by the American Psychological Association, a person's answer to these questions depends largely on the men's race - and that, researchers warn, may lead people to justify greater use of force against black men compared to their white counterparts.\n\nThe seven studies, conducted by researchers John Paul Wilson, Nicholas Rule, and Kurt Hugenberg, used a series of tests to get people to link people of different races to different body sizes and the potential meaning of those body sizes.\n\nIn six of the studies, hundreds of participants were tasked with connecting a man's face to body size, the potential harm a man could inflict, and whether use of force against that man would be justified in case of an altercation. In the seventh study, participants were asked to estimate a headless male body's size based on a color-inverted picture (to remove racial identifiers), but some participants were primed to believe - through a stereotypically black or white name or through a picture of a person's face - that the body picture was of a white man while others were primed to believe it's a black man.\n\nThroughout all these tests, researchers produced the same results: When participants believed the man in the images is black, they generally saw the man as larger, more threatening, and potentially more harmful in an altercation than a white person. And they were more likely to say use of force was justified against the black men than the white men.\n\nAgain, the men in these pictures were roughly the same size. One of the studies in the series even made sure the men even had similar bench press records. Yet identical and similar bodies were often equated as larger and more threatening strictly because the man was perceived as black instead of white.\n\nThe researchers argued that this was the result of stereotypes about black men being larger than white men. And, they pointed out, these stereotypes aren't true: \"The 2012 Center for Disease Control report on summarizing the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data places the average height of non-Hispanic White men (20 years or older) at 177.4 cm and 90.4 kgs, and of non-Hispanic Black men at 176.4 cm and 90.4 kgs.\"\n\nYet these stereotypes have serious consequences if they alter people's perceptions of black and white men. Consider the 2014 Cleveland police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice : After he was killed, the officers involved reported that they thought Rice was 20. While it's impossible to get into these cops' heads to see what they were thinking, it's possible they genuinely believed Rice was older because they saw Rice as bigger than he really was. This series of studies certainly suggests that's a possibility.\n\nOne caveat to the study: It drew participants from Amazon's MTurk, a work-for-pay service. Previous analyses have found that use of this system can skew participants so they're more college-educated, younger, and less wealthy than the general population, so the study participants may not be fully representative of the rest of the country.\n\nThere's also questions, the researchers said, about how exactly their findings would apply outside of a lab setting, and if the restricted range of men's sizes that they tested for - since the researchers relied largely on pictures of high school athletes - could impact participants' perceptions compared to if, say, they were looking at the bodies or faces of nonathletic or older men.\n\nBut this is a kind of research finding we've seen again and again: Black Americans are often associated with threatening behavior, particularly crime. And that may explain some of the disparities we see in police shootings.\n\nAs part of a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious \"dehumanization bias\" against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes. Researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones with a history of using force on black children in custody.\n\nIn the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children ages 10 and older as \"significantly less innocent\" than their white counterparts.\n\n\"Children in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,\" Philip Goff, an author of the study, said in a statement . \"Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.\"\n\nOther research suggests there can be superhumanization bias at work as well, with white people more likely to associate paranormal or magical powers with black people than with white people. And the more they associate magical powers with black people, the less likely they are to believe black people feel pain.\n\nAnother study found people tend to associate what the authors call \"black-sounding names,\" like DeShawn and Jamal, with larger, more violent people than they do \"white-sounding names,\" like Connor and Garrett.\n\n\"I've never been so disgusted by my own data,\" Colin Holbrook, the lead author of the study, said in a statement . \"The amount that our study participants assumed based only on a name was remarkable. A character with a black-sounding name was assumed to be physically larger, more prone to aggression, and lower in status than a character with a white-sounding name.\"\n\nThis is just a small sampling of the overall research. But no matter how these kinds of studies are conducted, there's a clear bias going on: Many Americans tend to associate black people with criminal behavior and violence. And that seems to lead to biased behavior.\n\nAn analysis of the available FBI data by Dara Lind for Vox found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete because it's based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.\n\nSome of these disparities are explained by socioeconomic factors - such as poverty, unemployment, segregation, and neglect by the police when it comes to serious crimes - that lead to more crime and violence in black communities. As a result, police tend to be more present in black neighborhoods - and therefore may be more likely to take policing actions, from traffic stops to arrests to shootings, in these areas.\n\nBut these structural disparities don't appear to explain everything. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests that perhaps other factors are involved in the disparities seen for these shootings, including racial bias.\n\nIndeed, the series of studies published by the American Psychological Association show that stereotypes of black men's bodies as larger and more threatening appear to lead people to justifying more use of force against black men. That unfortunately may offer some insight into the disparities seen in police shootings.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

      "text": "Creating next generation of Black male teachers a top mission for educator's nonprofit\n\nBlack male educators made up 1.3% of all K-12 teachers in 2020-2021 school year.\n\nWhen educator Curtis L. Lewis noticed he was the only Black, male teacher in a district of 20 elementary schools, he says he decided to do something about it.\n\n\"I began to think about what are some ways in which we can begin to shift this narrative. How do we begin to engage younger people, younger males, into the profession?\" Lewis told ABC News.\n\nIn the United States, Black male teachers made up 1.3% of all teachers in K-12 grades in public schools for the 2020-2021 school year, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS). That makes them the second least-represented demographic in teaching, with Asian men representing just 0.5% of all teachers.\n\nLewis, who holds a Ph.D., founded the Black Male Educators Alliance , or B.M.E.A, in 2017, a nonprofit that is dedicated to creating equitable educational environments where Black male educators and students can thrive.\n\n\"I began to focus on Michigan,\" Lewis said. \"And so that sort of also helped to facilitate that sort of the idea and grow that idea. I was really hyper, you know, hyper-focused, focused on getting quality teachers, but also really wanting to see if there are ways to engage Black men.\"\n\nAs B.M.E.A. grew, Lewis and his educators implemented the Youth Leadership Development Program, which follows an intergenerational mentor model to increase math and literacy proficiency among Black and Brown male students in pre-K through fifth grades.\n\nThis program engages students in relevant issues that affect them directly. The goal is to help them develop essential leadership skills, including communication, collaboration, and creative problem-solving, which they will need as they grow older.\n\nThe B.M.E.A program currently has 77 high school mentors in the Youth Leadership Development Program and just under 250 elementary school mentees.\n\n\"We believe our Youth Leadership Development Program has many benefits, but one is to help rebuild a pipeline of Black males interested in becoming teachers,\" educator Joseph said. \"And that program is an intergenerational model of mentoring, in which you have supervisors that serve as mentors and supervise the high school Black males who work in the local elementary schools.\"\n\nThe B.M.E.A. website states that the organization has a 100% retention rate for their Teacher and Principal Fellowships, as educators nationwide are committed to transforming education.\n\nIn Detroit, students feel the impact of B.M.E.A. and its programs. It's a ripple effect, with teachers influencing high school students and those same high school students becoming mentors for middle school students, according to Lewis.\n\n\"They help me grab my voice, like I know how to speak up for myself and speak up for others,\" high school student DeRick McCalebb said. \"Now, especially since I've been around elementary students and I've noticed like to recognize when something's wrong and kind of stand up for that in a way.\"\n\nThe program is designed to positively impact students like McCalebb, who can go back and be a role model to younger students. Mentors on elementary school levels prepare kids for high school while at the same time recognizing their influence by simply being themselves while striving to be the best versions of themselves.\n\nThe B.M.E.A. website reports that 91% of students in the math fellowship have shown growth through various assessment tests. A summer program for 150 Black males in grades 2-11 also continues the year-round Youth Leadership Development Program. The program offers math intervention, social and emotional learning, and cultural and identity development, according to the B.M.E.A. website.\n\n\"It's a fun job to do,\" high school teacher Walter Mathis said. \"Teaching is not really about the salary. Just seeing kids being inspired by, you know, look at it, me being a product in this community to, you know, give them the knowledge to say, OK, well, if he did it, I know I could do it, too. And so it is just a joy.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How viral videos of killings of black men take a toll on black male mental health\n\nAccording to health experts,  these videos can trigger mental health conditions.\n\nFor many black men, viral videos featuring the killings of other black men can weigh heavily. Watching the disturbing footage can impact the mental health of African American men, experts say.\n\nFor civil rights advocate and Georgetown Law Center professor Preston Mitchum, the images can lead to physical symptoms.\n\n\"My stomach is in knots, my heart is racing, my brain is pounding and none of that is hyperbolic,\" said Mitchum. \"It is exhausting to think that you can be up next.\"\n\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams offered a tearful statement during a press conference Wednesday. Though he couldn't bring himself to view the most recent killings, Williams said he was \"not okay.\"\n\n\"I am tired,\" said Williams. \"I have yet to watch the video of Ahmaud Arbery . It's too much. I have not watched the video of George Floyd. It's too much.\"\n\nFor others, the videos conjure mixed emotions like anger, despair and powerlessness.\n\n\"It hurts, but then also you're feeling anger, and then you have a feeling of helplessness, because, what can we do?\" said Rwenshaun Miller, a Charlotte, North Carolina, psychotherapist and founder of the nonprofit Eustress, Inc. that aims to improve mental health in black communities.\n\nVideo of Ahmaud Arbery , the Georgia man who was shot by a father and son while jogging in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, are the latest incidents capturing the brutalization of black men. The trauma collectively experienced by the black community in the wake of the incidents dates much further back.\n\n\"Being shown and seeing images that really demonstrate violence on the black body is something that is not only traumatizing from a contemporary perspective but it also has historical trauma. It really does sort of play to these like larger issues that have been with us for hundreds of years,\" said Martine Hackett, a public health professor at Hofstra University.\n\nThe beating and mutilation of slaves as punishment was accepted practice by slave owners. Late into the 20th century, the threat of lynching in the South was commonplace. Following the 1955 torture and murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy killed by two white men in Mississippi, pictures of his unrecognizable, mutilated body were published. The images of Till's remains are widely considered a flashpoint that ushered in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.\n\nAccording to health experts, repeated viewing of these images can trigger mental health conditions and impact overall health.\n\n\"We can experience PTSD, we can experience other mental health challenges as well anxiety, depression, all of these things may be a result of how we're in the world and as these images continue to circulate,\" said Miller. \"That added stress, the trauma and the constant worry will weigh on you very heavily. It's similar to living in a war zone.\"\n\n\"The stress of viewing these disturbing images has a physical manifestation. Often times, people will say, 'this makes me sick to my stomach' or 'I feel like I'm gonna choke' and those are really, those are actually legitimate feelings that you are having,\" said Hackett. \"And the truth is, that's one of the first things is to recognize that these stressors do play a role in our physical health.\"\n\nMitchum says that COVID-19 has only complicated the ways in which he and other black men would normally cope.\n\n\"Usually there's some kind of way for us to actually find joy, hanging out with your friends, engaging with your family, being able to experience a physical touch that's rooted in like love and affirmation, that's something that many of us are being denied because of COVID,\" said Mitchum.\n\nMiller recommends taking a timeout from consuming media to alleviate the feeling of bombardment by these violent images.\n\n\"The first thing we do is pick up our phone and start to scroll and that's all you're seeing. So I would suggest that people take a break from the news, take a break from the (social media) feeds,\" said Miller. \"You got to give yourself a break.\"\n\nHe suggests finding other outlets like talking to someone you trust, journaling, coloring or exercising to cope. He also encourages men to consider seeking therapy.\n\n\"Find ways to introduce self-care into your daily lifestyle, we can't wait until a traumatic event occurs and then we want to try to fix our mental health or take care of our mental health. We need to be proactive in doing these things.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Amid teacher shortage, Black male educators point to why there aren't more of them\n\n\"We're skipped over -- point-blank, period,\" one instructor said.\n\nEducator Marvin Burton Jr. is a self-described renaissance man.\n\n\"You have to be that type of teacher now,\" Burton Jr. told ABC News, adding, \"It's never a dull moment. I don't know of a teacher that's not tired when they leave from just the daily work -- the daily grind.\"\n\nThe advanced, professionally-certified vocal music instructor has taught everything from special education to English language arts over the past three school years because he said a nationwide teacher shortage has forced him in different directions. Burton Jr. said he's \"totally exhausted\" most evenings when leaving Drew-Freeman Middle School in Suitland, Maryland, driving to pick up his three sons in Temple Hills before commuting another half an hour home to Brandywine.\n\nThis is not unusual for pandemic-era teachers. Many have cited burnout and stress as primary issues amid COVID-19. The National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) 2022 School Pulse Panel reported 42% of all principals -- not just those with current vacancies -- said that teachers and staff leaving the profession became a \"more pressing concern\" during the last school year. And as schools with large numbers of minority students are suffering the worst staff shortages, NCES found about four in 10 schools with more than 75% minority populations, like Drew-Freeman, have multiple teaching vacancies.\n\nBut educators like Burton Jr. who spoke with ABC News this year described conditions that stretched beyond the pandemic in which Black male teachers were under-appreciated and outstretched -- with their numbers dwindling in the wake of what one advocate, speaking of staffing, has called a \"five-alarm crisis.\"\n\n\"I really feel like we're skipped over -- point-blank, period,\" Burton Jr. said. \"The way that the [education] system is laid out, I am always looked to as a disciplinarian, as the one that has the classroom management skills, as the one that is, you know, kind of firm footed,\" he added.\n\nDespite the current National Teacher of the Year honor going to Kurt Russell , a Black male history teacher in Ohio, who said the teacher workforce should look more like the demographics of the student population, the shortage of Black men in the profession has been evident for years. NCES' National Teacher and Principal Survey from 2017-2018 found Black men make up less than 2% of the nation's teachers.\n\nDr. Travis J. Bristol of the University of California, Berkeley, said the numbers do not appear to be trending in a positive direction.\n\n\"Often, people talk about the 1.9 [but] that number has fallen slightly: 1.7% of all U.S. public school teachers are Black men,\" Bristol told ABC News.\n\nBristol pointed to what some researchers have called the \"cradle to carceral\" pipeline -- from birth to prison or government-backed punishment -- as one of the main hurdles for Black boys who could become teachers, because Black children have been disproportionately suspended and expelled since preschool, according to the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, with boys receiving more than 75% of out-of-school suspensions.\n\nBristol believes that stark picture is often a reflection of society and has shrunk the pool of candidates.\n\n\"The Black male teacher shortage will end when we as a country begin to learn how to love Black boys,\" said the associate professor of teacher education and education policy at the University of California's School of Education. He added: \"You can't recruit people or create pathways for people in the profession until we stop suspending and expelling them before they even have an opportunity to enter the profession.\"\n\nDiversifying the school workforce has tangible benefits on instruction as well as representation, according to analyses. The National Bureau of Labor Economics found Black boys are more likely to graduate high school and enroll in college when taught by at least one Black teacher in elementary school, but NCES' survey on public school experiences with COVID-19 showed nearly 70% of principals reported too few candidates as the biggest challenge to hiring teachers for the 2022-2023 school year.\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona has announced several strategies to aid in the shortage by supporting teachers with $285-plus million in grant competitions this fiscal year.\n\n\"We are treating our efforts to recruit, prepare, and retain a talented and diverse educator workforce with the same level of urgency we brought to reopening our schools during the height of the pandemic,\" Cardona said in a statement this fall.\n\nSharif El-Mekki, the founder and CEO of the Center for Black Educator Development (CBED), who co-founded the Black Male Educators for Social Justice fellowship to inspire new generations of Black men to work for social justice through teaching, hopes school communities hire educators with varied cultural backgrounds and experiences who come from the communities that their students live in.\n\nBut El-Mekki told ABC News he sees the bleak number of Black teachers as an \"engineered\" byproduct of the Supreme Court's famous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, when the justices found that racially segregating children was unconstitutional in public schools. Response to the historic integration case paradoxically pushed thousands of Black teachers out of their classrooms and harmed the Black male teacher, El-Mekki said.\n\n\"The impact of Brown v. Board is multi-tiered,\" El-Mekki explained. \"The interpretation of Brown v. Board was even more damaging. The idea that it promoted -- that in order for a Black child to have excellence, it had to be in proximity of whiteness -- automatically erases a Black educator.\"\n\n\"[Brown] was about having Black children have access to the resources that supported public education at the level it was being supported for white children,\" according to Dr. Leslie T. Fenwick, dean emerita and professor of education policy at Howard University.\n\nFenwick's book \"Jim Crow's Pink Slip: The Untold Story of Black Principal and Teacher Leadership\" recounts how the Supreme Court decision was met by a fierce, mostly Southern \"white resistance\" from lawmakers, elected officials, superintendents and other constituents in 17 states -- from Virginia to Texas -- which fueled the exit of 100,000 Black teachers and principals.\n\nBut Fenwick argues that Black male educators' flight was not an unintended consequence of the case. Rather, it was a result of opposition to the \"law of the land.\"\n\n\"None of this is laid at the feet of the Brown decision,\" Fenwick said, adding that \"white resistance to the Brown decision interrupted the Black male teacher pipeline.\"\n\nFenwick praised the Brown decision and its intentions for education in America, but she said the nation's public schools have yet to recover from that segregationist strategy.\n\n\"Brown never meant close all the Black schools and shuffle Black students into previously segregated all-white schools, but that was one of the strategies used to resist the intention of the law,\" she said. \"We're still living with the aftermath of this history. The history began the cycle and then there are other barriers that have continued to exacerbate the problem.\"\n\nAdditionally, experts told ABC News that schools utilized Black male educators, particularly principals at all-Black institutions, in abundance before integration occurred. They said men were the predominant figures in U.S. principalship for decades. Today, Black men are just under 4% of the nation's principals compared to white men who make-up more than a third. Women didn't start to lead schools at higher rates until the 1990s, the experts said, and white women are the largest demographic, according to NCES data.\n\nTeaching, though, has been widely viewed as a caretaking profession with unfair compensation, advocates told ABC News. In fact, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) , which lobbies on behalf of the needs of low- and middle-income workers, found the relative pay gap between teachers and similarly educated non-teachers hit a \"record\" high in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the Teacher Salary Project has sought to raise awareness around underpaying educators. Board President Ellen Sherratt said that if teaching becomes a financially viable profession, it will help recruitment, retention and diversity.\n\n\"They [teachers] mean everything to the students in their classrooms when they're able to be their best selves and they're able to support students fully, socially, emotionally, academically, when they're not working with second and third jobs that take away their ability to be there fully,\" Sherratt said.\n\nStill, Bristol's quantitative study looking at two different sets of Black men working within the same Boston school district found that retention is a lingering problem. The first set studied Black men who were the only Black male educators at their school, and the second set studied those who had at least three other Black men working at the same school.\n\nThe study found one of the biggest challenges has been retaining the Black men teachers who are surrounded by others because they are typically placed at schools that face greater difficulties and there are fewer chances to succeed.\n\n\"The ones who were concentrated in the most challenging schools were leaving because of the working conditions,\" Bristol said. \"They [Black males] didn't have opportunities to teach the way that they wanted to teach and their principals were not supportive of them,\" he said.\n\nEighteen years in, Burton Jr. remains an educator because he sees himself in the Black boys who attend his school located in the predominantly Black Prince George's County -- which has the highest African American population in the state -- according to the 2021 U.S. Census.\n\n\"All they need, really, they need education and they need a mentor,\" Burton Jr. said. \"And I see that we're not providing the resources, the care to them that they need to be what -- I would think -- America needs.\"\n\nWashington, D.C., STEM teacher Jonté Lee serves as a mentor to the Black boys at Whittier Elementary. Entering the final stretch of his 11-year career, some parents have asked Lee, who focuses on science, technology, engineering and math, to take their son under his wing.\n\nAfter a parent-teacher conference this fall, Lee told ABC News he was experiencing \"mentor overload\" from the educator shortage. He called the pandemic burnout \"unfair\" because each year there has been the same workload but not enough workers.\n\n\"You are expecting a certain type of Black male mentor, a Black male figure -- somebody -- where?\" Lee said. \"I didn't even know the number dropped to 1.7 [percent]. Look at where we are now. Where are we going to find them?\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Harris works to appeal to Black men, a critical group for Democrats\n\nThe vice president will continue to court Black men while in Detroit.\n\nFor a second day this week, Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing on a key voting bloc that is a critical base for the Democratic Party: Black men.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris will participate in an audio town hall event with Charlemagne tha God, host for the popular \"The Breakfast Club\" podcast. Also on Tuesday, the vice president is meeting with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit.\n\nHer events come a day after her campaign rolled out a comprehensive plan -- just three weeks until the election -- to help Black men \"get ahead\" economically, which includes providing one million fully forgivable loans to Black entrepreneurs and an effort to invest in Black male teachers.\n\nIn an interview on \"Roland Martin Unfiltered,\" also released on Monday, Harris argued that economic policies that consider \"historical barriers\" facing Black people benefit all Americans.\n\n\"If you have public policy, and I'm talking about economic public policy specifically at this point, but if you have public policy that recognizes historical barriers and what we need to do then to overcome,\" Harris said. \"First, speak truth about them and then overcome them, that in the process of doing that, not only are you directly dealing with the injustices and the legal and procedural barriers that have been focused on Black folks, but by eliminating those barriers, everyone actually benefits, right?\"\n\nThe focus on Black voters comes after former President Barack Obama sternly chided Black men over \"excuses\" to not vote for Harris while speaking to a group of Black at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood last week.\n\n\"You have [Trump], who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person, and you're thinking about sitting out?\" Obama asked. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses?\"\n\nHarris is polling ahead of Trump with Black voters who are registered to vote, 82-13%, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll . That compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago), the poll found.\n\nThese differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant, and Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said he agrees.\n\n\"I don't buy this idea that there will be huge swaths of Black men voting for Donald Trump. That's not going to happen. What I would urge folks to do is to show up, to understand that if you don't vote, that is a vote for Donald Trump. That's the concern.,\" said Warnock on a Tuesday campaign call with reporters.\n\nPart of the Harris campaign's plan for Black men includes legalizing recreational marijuana nationwide. Such a move would \"break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back,\" the campaign said in its release.\n\nThis takes the Biden administration's current stance, which includes pardoning people convicted of marijuana possession, a step further. For Harris' part, such a proposal is evidence of her evolving position. She has become more progressive since her time as attorney general of California when she was heavily criticized for aggressively prosecuting weed-related crimes.\n\nAsked if she ever smoked by Charlamagne tha God back in 2019, Harris responded, \"I have. And I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago. But, yes.\"\n\nShe went on to clarify that she believes in legalizing the substance.\n\n\"I have had concerns, the full record, I have had concerns, which I think -- first of all, let me just make this statement very clear, I believe we need to legalize marijuana,\" she said. \"Now, that being said -- and this is not a 'but,' it is an 'and' -- and we need to research, which is one of the reasons we need to legalize it. We need to move it on the schedule so that we can research the impact of weed on a developing brain. You know, that part of the brain that develops judgment, actually begins its growth at age 18 through age 24.\"\n\nHer answer garnered backlash due to her record prosecuting the substance, particularly given the racial disparities in punishment nationwide. Harris' new proposal looks to correct those historical inequities.\n\nBut is it enough?\n\nIn addition to the new proposals, Harris has aggressively been campaigning in Black communities in the past week, stopping at several local Black-owned businesses and churches in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan as well as appearing on several media programs with predominately Black audiences.\n\nIn September, Harris told a group of Black reporters in a moderated conversation hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists that she was \"working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.\"\n\nHer campaign launched a \"Black Men Huddle\" organizing call on Monday, which featured remarks from campaign senior officials Tony West, Brian Nelson, Quentin Fulks and Rep. Cedric Richmond. Later, there was a weekly event focused on Black men supporting Harris featuring actor Don Cheadle.\n\n\"What the vice president is doing is giving us the tools to be able to go and have meaningful, impactful conversations when Black men turn back around to us and say, 'Well, what's in it for me,' I think that we have policy and tools like this that we can say exactly that,\" said Fulks.\n\nDoc Rivers, who interviewed Harris for his \"ALL the SMOKE\" podcast on Monday , said he agreed with Obama's comments last week and pushed for Black men to cast their ballots.\n\n\"I agree 100% with President Obama -- it's unacceptable not to vote. When you look back at what your parents and your grandparents had to do to get the right to vote, that's unacceptable for me,\" said Rivers. \"But there are Black men who out there that feel hopeless, they don't believe a vote helps them in either way, and I'm here to tell them they're wrong.\"\n\nABC News interviewed Black men in Pittsburgh's predominately Black Homewood Brushton neighborhood last Friday about their impressions of Harris and what she needed to do to get their vote.\n\nAquail Bey, a student at The Community College of Allegheny County and president of its veterans club, said Harris needs to meet them where they are and genuinely speak with them.\n\n\"She's doing a good job right now, but I think she should have -- go to places where they are, you know, meet them on their own terms, you know. Go to the neighborhoods where they are, go to the barber shops ... \" Bey said. \"Wherever the Black men are, go to where they are, speak to them a way that they understand.\"\n\nAaron Stuckey said people shouldn't assume Black men aren't getting behind Harris.\n\n\"Just poll us instead of assuming that that's where we're not going,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Black men ask, 'What am I voting for?' as they battle frustration\n\nAfrican American men emerge as a key swing vote in battleground states.\n\nAt an invite-only event in downtown Atlanta, hip-hop fans from across the country came together for a unique voter outreach event.\n\nThe Black Male Voter Project, an organization dedicated to increasing civic engagement among Black men, partnered with some of the biggest names in the battle rap to host the No Cap Conference.\n\nThe political conference aimed to educate and galvanize a sector of young Black men who are disengaged and unlikely to vote in the November election.\n\n\"It's called No Cap. No cap, in a young Black man's language, means 'no lies. This is the truth,\" Mondale Robinson, the organization's founder, told ABC News Chief National Correspondent and \"Nightline\" Co-Anchor Byron Pitts.\n\n\"Our purpose was to talk to the Black men who don't participate in the election,\" Robinson said.\n\nPopular underground rappers sparred bar for bar to earn cash prizes and bragging rights as a packed crowd cheered them on.\n\nThere were no slogans, no campaign buttons, and no candidates. ABC News' \"Nightline\" was granted exclusive access to the event.\n\nThe rap battle was an appetizer for No Cap conference-goers, and civic education was the main course. Attendees, many of whom have never voted in any election, participated in seminars about election misinformation and the history of the 15th Amendment, which granted African American men the right to vote.\n\nThe conference also showcased ways for the rappers to leverage their platforms to amplify political campaigns and politicians they support.\n\nThe ultimate goal was to ignite political awareness among those who are typically disengaged from the election process.\n\nFor Robinson, the hope is that through camaraderie and shared interest, the Black men in attendance would be inspired to become more politically involved in both local and federal elections.\n\n\"We talk to the brothers that the world doesn't want to talk to,\" Robinson said. \"Nobody's doing that.\n\nIn every election cycle, presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle historically court Black men with a formulaic strategy: making stops at pulpits in churches, hosting barbershop talks, and appearing in roundtables at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nHowever, Robinson argues that the usual campaign strategy often misses the opportunity to engage with some of the most marginalized and disenchanted voters.\n\nThe narrative that young Black male voters are apathetic to the importance of the election is false, Robinson told \"Nightline.\" He said that it's ineffective campaign messaging and stalled delivery of campaign promises that ultimately impact voter turnout among the Black male voting bloc.\n\n\"There's no apathy in Black men. There's a level of antipathy. Antipathy is a whole different emotion. You hate what politics is and does because you've not seen the growth, or benefit of it. Black men are not better off because of politics,\" Robinson said.\n\nBlack men have been a core of the Democratic Party's path to victory, with more than 80% of them identifying with the party for the last 25 years, according to Pew Research .\n\nAnd while the Black community still overwhelmingly supports Democrats, some of that support could be eroding. A recent ABC News poll shows that more Black people may have moved away from President Joe Biden.\n\nSome of the Black voters most likely to support former President Donald Trump are those under the age of 50, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn 2020, record turnout among Black voters in battleground states delivered the Oval Office to Biden. It's an acknowledgment the president makes often on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Because Black Americans voted, Kamala [Harris] and I are president and vice president of the United States. Because of you. That's not hyperbole,\" Biden told a crowd of Black voters during a campaign stop in Philadelphia on May 29.\n\nHowever, a Washington Post/ Ipsos poll released in May is raising alarms among Democrats that voter turnout may be a challenge for the party in November, as nearly 1 in 5 Black voters who turned out for Biden in 2020 say they are less than certain about whether they will vote at all this year.\n\nIn an election year that could be a toss-up in key battleground states, younger Black men showing up at the polls could play a pivotal role.\n\nHeadlining the No Cap conference was Hitman Holla and John John Da Don, two artists, entertainers, and fathers in their 30s. They told ABC News that up until the conference they never discussed politics with each other despite being friends in the music industry for years.\n\nThey have only voted once in their lives, helping to elect former President Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nHowever, Hitman Holla told Pitts that he saw very little change in the social issues impacting the Black community, noting the ongoing battle with disproportionate police brutality.\n\nSince Obama's first term, the rapper says he has been reluctant to vote again. \"Voting is the last thing on my mind,\" Hitman Holla said.\n\n\"They all want me to vote, but for what? So Mike Brown can get shot . . .? That's what I'm voting for? So, George Floyd can get killed on camera? What am I voting for? What am I going to stand in this line for and vote for one of these people? Y'all want to act like my vote really matters.\"\n\nHitman Holla and John John Da Don are still undecided, but tell ABC News they are leaning toward voting for Trump.\n\n\"I feel like there was more change when Trump was in office than Biden if we have to compare what's going on,\" John John Da Don said, highlighting his trust in the former president on issues relating to the economy.\n\nThe rapper is not alone in his sentiments. On issues related to the economy and inflation, adults surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos said they trusted Trump over Biden by a margin of 14 percentage points.\n\nBut for Hitman, the reticence toward Biden is not a full-throated endorsement of Trump, either.\n\n\"I'll vote, but they're my only options?\" Hitman Holla continued. \"It's like, 'Hey, do you want to burn your hand in the oven, or do you want to burn your hand in the toaster?\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Biden administration has focused outreach efforts in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, touting progress in student debt relief, support for Black-owned businesses, as well as improvements in inflation and employment.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also tried to court Black voters in myriad ways.\n\nTrump spoke during a roundtable at a church in Detroit with Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Former Housing Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, two prominent Black conservatives and vice presidential contenders, to highlight his record on the economic and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nDuring the roundtable Trump also highlighted his record on criminal justice reform, particularly for his signing of the First Step Act of 2018, legislation that created a system of rehabilitation incentives for incarcerated individuals meant to reduce recidivism rates.\n\n\"We passed historic criminal justice reform. Something that they've been after, people have been after, mostly the Black community, for years and years,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"President Obama tried and was unable to get it done. You needed conservative votes and I got conservative votes. We got criminal justice reform done. Nobody else could've done that,\" Trump continued.\n\nCritics have scrutinized some of the Trump campaign's outreach strategies. Earlier this year, the former president faced backlash after insinuating that his multiple indictments and ongoing legal woes made him more relatable to Black voters.\n\n\"My mug shot, we've all seen the mug shot and you know who embraced it more than anybody else? The Black population,\" Trump said while speaking at the Black Conservative Federation's annual BCF Honors Gala at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center in Columbia, S.C., on Feb. 23.\n\nDuring the gala, Trump also said, \"I got indicted a second time and a third time. I got a fourth time and a lot of people said that, 'That's why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against.\"\n\nAddul Ali, a Black Republican congressional candidate in North Carolina's 12th district, who supports Trump, was in the room when Trump made the controversial remarks. He told ABC News he was not offended.\n\n\"The problem is that we have a double standard,\" Ali said. \"Donald Trump's mug shot T-shirt is racist, but you all having some hip-hop gerbils sell me a car is not. Black culture in America is identified as 'gangsta,'\" Ali said.\n\nThe former president also unveiled Trump-branded sneakers and has aligned himself with rappers and pop culture figures in recent years to woo young Black voters.\n\nIn Raleigh, North Carolina, college students who will be voting for the first time in November told Pitts that Trump's outreach attempts aren't translating.\n\n\"I kind of feel disgusted that he felt like he could get to us by making jokes about going to jail and relating to us that way. It's not what we stand for as people. That's not us as a whole,\" Aaron McKinley Veal, a junior at Winston-Salem State University, said.\n\nAhmad Blair, a junior at North Carolina A &T University, said that while he finds it offensive, he recognizes how it energizes some voters who support Trump.\n\n\"The thing is they say those things and while we know them to be wrong, it's effective. It energizes the people that it needs to,\" Blair said.\n\nMuch like Hitman Holla and John John Da Don in Atlanta, Blair says it's difficult not to be disillusioned by the current political landscape.\n\n\"I'm so politically tired,\" Blair told ABC News. \"I don't even know what issues I care about anymore. I know that reproductive rights are important to me, but I'm tired. Constantly having to fight as a Black man in every space. You have to fight when you enter these white spaces. You're fighting in a housing market applying for apartments because you can be discriminated against just for being Black. It's like every system is built in opposition to our success,\" Blair continued.\n\nDespite feeling political fatigue, Black male HBCU students told \"Nightline\" they are still committed to casting ballots in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\"\"I think it's really important. Our ancestors fought for this,\" said Julian Goodman, an incoming freshman at Morehouse College. \"We're coming into one of the biggest elections ever. So I feel like it's very important for Black people, in general, to vote, to go out and voice their opinions.\"\n\nNorth Carolina has been a mainstay in the story of Black political progress in America and HBCUs have been at the center.\n\nIn Greensboro, North Carolina, four HBCU students famously spearheaded the nationwide sit-in movement in 1960, which led to widespread desegregation of stores in the South.\n\nThe Tar Heel state was among one of the common stops for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his crusade for civil rights.\n\nFor generations, the Black church has been instrumental in getting voters to the polls and fighting for access to the ballot box.\n\nIn Charlotte, it's a history that will continue at Chappell Memorial Baptist Church. Rev. Dr. Gregory Moss has helped organize voter outreach, including the \"Souls to the Polls\" program, for much of the 46 years he's been a pastor.\n\n\"The church cannot tell you who to vote for, but we can emphasize the importance of exercising your right as a citizen,\" Moss said, adding that he sees his voter outreach as an extension of Sunday service.\n\n\"We have a predominance of working-class people and oftentimes when the polls are open, they don't always have the luxury of being able to leave their job to go to the polls,\" Moss said.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign has made several stops in North Carolina, Moss still hopes to see more intentional ground game and creative outreach in the Black community.\n\n\"At the end of the day, again, it's getting out there touching people,\" Moss said.\n\n\"It's not just on social media. It's not just through 10-second sound bites. It's getting out there among folk and doing old-school politics.\"\n\nABC News' Rachel Rosenbaum and Stephanie Lorenzo contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Obama rips Trump, chides Black men over 'excuses' for not voting for Harris\n\nHe started a multi-state campaign tour in Pittsburgh Thursday night.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama sternly chided Black men over \"excuses\" to not vote for Vice President Kamala Harris during a stop at a campaign field office on Thursday in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood ahead of his rally, saying he finds them sitting out or voting for former President Donald Trump \"not acceptable.\"\n\nThe event kicked off a blitz through battleground states as Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign deploys its strongest political asset headed into the final stretch.\n\n\"I remember when I was running for the U.S. Senate there were people who didn't think I could win that and, certainly, when I was running for president, people like, 'what's his name, again?' And 'that's not going to happen,'\" Obama said. \"And that included, by the way -- in our own communities there were people who were skeptical. They liked me and they really liked Michelle, but they thought, 'well, that's not going to happen,' because sometimes we have a tendency to put a ceiling on ourselves.\"\n\nWith early voting already underway in critical battleground Pennsylvania, campaign officials told ABC News Obama's focus over the next few weeks would be getting out the vote, inspiring people, and setting up the stakes of the presidential election.\n\n\"The good news here is we've got an outstanding woman of high character and extraordinary accomplishment who has already been the vice president of the United States,\" the former president added. \"So, we don't have to imagine whether it can happen. It can happen, but it will be dependent on our willingness to do the work.\"\n\nHowever, Obama said he needed to \"speak some truths,\" particularly with Black men because he's hearing \"we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running.\"\n\n\"Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. When you have a choice that is this clear. When, on the one hand, you have somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences, who's had to work harder and do more and overcome and achieves the second highest office in the land and is putting forward concrete proposals to directly address the things that are vital in our neighborhoods and our communities,\" Obama said, listing housing to affordable prescription drugs, education and entrepreneurship.\n\n\"And that's all one side. And on the other side, you have someone who has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person, and you're thinking about sitting out?\" Obama continued. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses? I've got a problem with that because -- because part of it makes me think, and I'm speaking to men directly now, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\n\"They've been raising us and working and having our backs, and when we get in trouble and the system's not working for us, they're the ones who are out there marching and protesting and -- and so now you're thinking about sitting out or even supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that's a sign of strength? Because that's what being a man is? Putting women down?\" Obama charged. \"That's not acceptable.\"\n\nObama also took the opportunity to rip Trump about \"intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments.\"\n\n\"We had one of the deadliest hurricanes in American history,\" Obama said, later adding, \"Amazing people devastated. Hundreds of people killed and President Biden and Vice President Harris were down there meeting with local officials and comforting families, asking how they could help. And Donald Trump at a rally just started making up stories about the Biden administration withholding aid from Republican areas and siphoning off aid to give to undocumented immigrants. Just made this stuff up.\"\n\n\"Everybody knew it wasn't true,\" Obama continued. \"Even local Republicans said it was not true. And now the people of Florida are dealing with another devastating storm. And I want you to watch what happens over the next few days. Just like the last time, you're going to have leaders who try to help, and then they're -- you have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points. And this has consequences because people are afraid, and they've lost everything, and now they're trying to figure out, how do I apply for help? And -- and -- and some of them may be discouraged from getting the help they need.\"\n\n\"The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments. And my question is, when did that become okay?\"\n\nObama also defined the stakes as four more years of Harris' opponent, former President Donald Trump .\n\n\"We don't need four more years of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division,\" he told the crowd. \"America is ready to turn the page. We are ready for a better story, one that helps us work together instead of turning against each other. Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHe also made a push for the reelection of Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who introduced him on the stage.\n\nWhile voters at the Obama rally were fired up for Harris, and the campaign is hoping to carry the torch from the political coalition that Obama started, it was a starkly different picture on the streets of Pittsburgh.\n\nSeveral voters said they haven't registered to vote and don't plan to vote this November.\n\nCameron Lane, a 26-year-old from Pittsburgh, said he's never voted before and that there's virtually nothing that would persuade him to go to the polls this time.\n\n\"I don't like the options,\" Lane said.\n\nNikki Marsh said she's going to vote, but is not even telling her family or friends who she's voting for because of how politically divided they are.\n\nMarsh said politics is a \"very sensitive subject in the community\" and doesn't believe at this point that anything is going to sway voters to change their minds, regardless of any big-name endorsement. For instance, she didn't believe Harris endorsements from political figures like Obama or Liz Cheney would move people one way or another.\n\nIvan Gil-Silva, who owns a restaurant in Pittsburgh, said he's voting for the first time this year and he's voting for former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I have a business, and I've been struggling heavily for the past four years. It's been awful,\" Gil-Silva said. \"My neighborhood's become absolutely dangerous. I've never seen this many homeless people in my life. In 20 years I've been in Pittsburgh. I've never seen it be like this.\"\n\nWhile Gil-Silva says he isn't a fan of Trump as a person, he says at least \"everything was peaceful\" when he was in office. Gil-Silva called Harris a \"joke,\" saying she has no \"substance.\"\n\nBut Harris supporters at the rally site said they remained \"hopeful.\"\n\n\"Cautiously optimistic. I'm very excited for her campaign,\" Sam Carew-Jones said. \"I'm very excited for her to win. It's going to be close. I'm holding my breath.\"\n\nABC News' Michelle Stoddart and Fritz Farrow contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Instead, many rely on faith and family for emotional support.\n\nFor several years, Bell said he himself lived an unhealthy lifestyle and was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a serious heart condition left doctors recommending a pacemaker, Changa decided he needed to turn his life around and started with yoga.\n\nBurnett told \"GMA\" that the yoga practice also creates a sense of community for the black men who join.\n\n\"It's important for us to have these conversations for one among ourselves because we start to believe the stories that are being told about us,\" he said. \"We're loving our communities.

      "text": "Black men ask, 'What am I voting for?' as they battle frustration\n\nAfrican American men emerge as a key swing vote in battleground states.\n\nAt an invite-only event in downtown Atlanta, hip-hop fans from across the country came together for a unique voter outreach event.\n\nThe Black Male Voter Project, an organization dedicated to increasing civic engagement among Black men, partnered with some of the biggest names in the battle rap to host the No Cap Conference.\n\nThe political conference aimed to educate and galvanize a sector of young Black men who are disengaged and unlikely to vote in the November election.\n\n\"It's called No Cap. No cap, in a young Black man's language, means 'no lies. This is the truth,\" Mondale Robinson, the organization's founder, told ABC News Chief National Correspondent and \"Nightline\" Co-Anchor Byron Pitts.\n\n\"Our purpose was to talk to the Black men who don't participate in the election,\" Robinson said.\n\nPopular underground rappers sparred bar for bar to earn cash prizes and bragging rights as a packed crowd cheered them on.\n\nThere were no slogans, no campaign buttons, and no candidates. ABC News' \"Nightline\" was granted exclusive access to the event.\n\nThe rap battle was an appetizer for No Cap conference-goers, and civic education was the main course. Attendees, many of whom have never voted in any election, participated in seminars about election misinformation and the history of the 15th Amendment, which granted African American men the right to vote.\n\nThe conference also showcased ways for the rappers to leverage their platforms to amplify political campaigns and politicians they support.\n\nThe ultimate goal was to ignite political awareness among those who are typically disengaged from the election process.\n\nFor Robinson, the hope is that through camaraderie and shared interest, the Black men in attendance would be inspired to become more politically involved in both local and federal elections.\n\n\"We talk to the brothers that the world doesn't want to talk to,\" Robinson said. \"Nobody's doing that.\n\nIn every election cycle, presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle historically court Black men with a formulaic strategy: making stops at pulpits in churches, hosting barbershop talks, and appearing in roundtables at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nHowever, Robinson argues that the usual campaign strategy often misses the opportunity to engage with some of the most marginalized and disenchanted voters.\n\nThe narrative that young Black male voters are apathetic to the importance of the election is false, Robinson told \"Nightline.\" He said that it's ineffective campaign messaging and stalled delivery of campaign promises that ultimately impact voter turnout among the Black male voting bloc.\n\n\"There's no apathy in Black men. There's a level of antipathy. Antipathy is a whole different emotion. You hate what politics is and does because you've not seen the growth, or benefit of it. Black men are not better off because of politics,\" Robinson said.\n\nBlack men have been a core of the Democratic Party's path to victory, with more than 80% of them identifying with the party for the last 25 years, according to Pew Research .\n\nAnd while the Black community still overwhelmingly supports Democrats, some of that support could be eroding. A recent ABC News poll shows that more Black people may have moved away from President Joe Biden.\n\nSome of the Black voters most likely to support former President Donald Trump are those under the age of 50, according to Pew Research.\n\nIn 2020, record turnout among Black voters in battleground states delivered the Oval Office to Biden. It's an acknowledgment the president makes often on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Because Black Americans voted, Kamala [Harris] and I are president and vice president of the United States. Because of you. That's not hyperbole,\" Biden told a crowd of Black voters during a campaign stop in Philadelphia on May 29.\n\nHowever, a Washington Post/ Ipsos poll released in May is raising alarms among Democrats that voter turnout may be a challenge for the party in November, as nearly 1 in 5 Black voters who turned out for Biden in 2020 say they are less than certain about whether they will vote at all this year.\n\nIn an election year that could be a toss-up in key battleground states, younger Black men showing up at the polls could play a pivotal role.\n\nHeadlining the No Cap conference was Hitman Holla and John John Da Don, two artists, entertainers, and fathers in their 30s. They told ABC News that up until the conference they never discussed politics with each other despite being friends in the music industry for years.\n\nThey have only voted once in their lives, helping to elect former President Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nHowever, Hitman Holla told Pitts that he saw very little change in the social issues impacting the Black community, noting the ongoing battle with disproportionate police brutality.\n\nSince Obama's first term, the rapper says he has been reluctant to vote again. \"Voting is the last thing on my mind,\" Hitman Holla said.\n\n\"They all want me to vote, but for what? So Mike Brown can get shot . . .? That's what I'm voting for? So, George Floyd can get killed on camera? What am I voting for? What am I going to stand in this line for and vote for one of these people? Y'all want to act like my vote really matters.\"\n\nHitman Holla and John John Da Don are still undecided, but tell ABC News they are leaning toward voting for Trump.\n\n\"I feel like there was more change when Trump was in office than Biden if we have to compare what's going on,\" John John Da Don said, highlighting his trust in the former president on issues relating to the economy.\n\nThe rapper is not alone in his sentiments. On issues related to the economy and inflation, adults surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos said they trusted Trump over Biden by a margin of 14 percentage points.\n\nBut for Hitman, the reticence toward Biden is not a full-throated endorsement of Trump, either.\n\n\"I'll vote, but they're my only options?\" Hitman Holla continued. \"It's like, 'Hey, do you want to burn your hand in the oven, or do you want to burn your hand in the toaster?\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Biden administration has focused outreach efforts in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, touting progress in student debt relief, support for Black-owned businesses, as well as improvements in inflation and employment.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also tried to court Black voters in myriad ways.\n\nTrump spoke during a roundtable at a church in Detroit with Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Former Housing Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, two prominent Black conservatives and vice presidential contenders, to highlight his record on the economic and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nDuring the roundtable Trump also highlighted his record on criminal justice reform, particularly for his signing of the First Step Act of 2018, legislation that created a system of rehabilitation incentives for incarcerated individuals meant to reduce recidivism rates.\n\n\"We passed historic criminal justice reform. Something that they've been after, people have been after, mostly the Black community, for years and years,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"President Obama tried and was unable to get it done. You needed conservative votes and I got conservative votes. We got criminal justice reform done. Nobody else could've done that,\" Trump continued.\n\nCritics have scrutinized some of the Trump campaign's outreach strategies. Earlier this year, the former president faced backlash after insinuating that his multiple indictments and ongoing legal woes made him more relatable to Black voters.\n\n\"My mug shot, we've all seen the mug shot and you know who embraced it more than anybody else? The Black population,\" Trump said while speaking at the Black Conservative Federation's annual BCF Honors Gala at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center in Columbia, S.C., on Feb. 23.\n\nDuring the gala, Trump also said, \"I got indicted a second time and a third time. I got a fourth time and a lot of people said that, 'That's why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against.\"\n\nAddul Ali, a Black Republican congressional candidate in North Carolina's 12th district, who supports Trump, was in the room when Trump made the controversial remarks. He told ABC News he was not offended.\n\n\"The problem is that we have a double standard,\" Ali said. \"Donald Trump's mug shot T-shirt is racist, but you all having some hip-hop gerbils sell me a car is not. Black culture in America is identified as 'gangsta,'\" Ali said.\n\nThe former president also unveiled Trump-branded sneakers and has aligned himself with rappers and pop culture figures in recent years to woo young Black voters.\n\nIn Raleigh, North Carolina, college students who will be voting for the first time in November told Pitts that Trump's outreach attempts aren't translating.\n\n\"I kind of feel disgusted that he felt like he could get to us by making jokes about going to jail and relating to us that way. It's not what we stand for as people. That's not us as a whole,\" Aaron McKinley Veal, a junior at Winston-Salem State University, said.\n\nAhmad Blair, a junior at North Carolina A &T University, said that while he finds it offensive, he recognizes how it energizes some voters who support Trump.\n\n\"The thing is they say those things and while we know them to be wrong, it's effective. It energizes the people that it needs to,\" Blair said.\n\nMuch like Hitman Holla and John John Da Don in Atlanta, Blair says it's difficult not to be disillusioned by the current political landscape.\n\n\"I'm so politically tired,\" Blair told ABC News. \"I don't even know what issues I care about anymore. I know that reproductive rights are important to me, but I'm tired. Constantly having to fight as a Black man in every space. You have to fight when you enter these white spaces. You're fighting in a housing market applying for apartments because you can be discriminated against just for being Black. It's like every system is built in opposition to our success,\" Blair continued.\n\nDespite feeling political fatigue, Black male HBCU students told \"Nightline\" they are still committed to casting ballots in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\"\"I think it's really important. Our ancestors fought for this,\" said Julian Goodman, an incoming freshman at Morehouse College. \"We're coming into one of the biggest elections ever. So I feel like it's very important for Black people, in general, to vote, to go out and voice their opinions.\"\n\nNorth Carolina has been a mainstay in the story of Black political progress in America and HBCUs have been at the center.\n\nIn Greensboro, North Carolina, four HBCU students famously spearheaded the nationwide sit-in movement in 1960, which led to widespread desegregation of stores in the South.\n\nThe Tar Heel state was among one of the common stops for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his crusade for civil rights.\n\nFor generations, the Black church has been instrumental in getting voters to the polls and fighting for access to the ballot box.\n\nIn Charlotte, it's a history that will continue at Chappell Memorial Baptist Church. Rev. Dr. Gregory Moss has helped organize voter outreach, including the \"Souls to the Polls\" program, for much of the 46 years he's been a pastor.\n\n\"The church cannot tell you who to vote for, but we can emphasize the importance of exercising your right as a citizen,\" Moss said, adding that he sees his voter outreach as an extension of Sunday service.\n\n\"We have a predominance of working-class people and oftentimes when the polls are open, they don't always have the luxury of being able to leave their job to go to the polls,\" Moss said.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign has made several stops in North Carolina, Moss still hopes to see more intentional ground game and creative outreach in the Black community.\n\n\"At the end of the day, again, it's getting out there touching people,\" Moss said.\n\n\"It's not just on social media. It's not just through 10-second sound bites. It's getting out there among folk and doing old-school politics.\"\n\nABC News' Rachel Rosenbaum and Stephanie Lorenzo contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Here, Black men and women tell their stories.\n\nBy Max Abelson, Sonali Basak, Kelsey Butler, Matthew Leising, Jenny Surane, and Gillian Tan\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nIt might seem impossible to tell the history of Black people on Wall Street. That's because the finance industry shut African Americans out of its executive suites and banking partnerships and off trading floors for decades. Even now, despite diversity programs and pledges to do better, Wall Street's highest echelons lack Black faces, with rare exceptions.\n\nAnother challenge to telling the story of African Americans in finance is that the people who've lived it blazed wildly different paths. There is no one definitive experience.\n\nBut all their stories matter. What happens inside this industry ripples out into American wallets, homes, neighborhoods, corporations, and government. Outright racism and institutional failings on Wall Street have limited Black wealth and dreams. But African-American bankers have also sometimes helped pave the way for others to succeed.\n\nThis year's corporate avowals, workplace statistics, and diversity benchmarks have risen in a cacophony that risks drowning out the very voices they're meant to spotlight.\n\nSome of those voices, edited for brevity and clarity, speak out on these pages. They reflect decades of a Black presence on Wall Street, from just a few years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination to today, amid fury over George Floyd's death at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nSome made it to the top, some left disenchanted. Some became rich, some were so marginalized they had to sue.\n\nSome think Wall Street is hopeless, some are more optimistic than ever. -Kelsey Butler and Max Abelson\n\nRacquel Oden, 47, is northeast divisional director for the consumer bank and wealth management business at JPMorgan Chase & Co., overseeing 10,000 employees. She began her career in 1997 as an equity trader at Morgan Stanley and has also held roles at Merrill Lynch and UBS Group AG.\n\nI didn't have any family who ever worked on Wall Street, so it wasn't anything I knew. I had an unusual career in that I graduated with my MBA from Hampton University, an HBCU [historically Black college or university], which is very different, and was recruited to Morgan Stanley and joined the equity division, which started my career on Wall Street.\n\nBoth my parents were immigrants to this country, and I was the first to attend college and experience life here in the United States. With that, I was definitely taught to have a strong work ethic: Focus on your education. Did I ever feel [I had] to be twice as good? A hundred percent. I was a Black woman on Wall Street, so I knew that was par for the course.\n\nTessie Petion was an intern at Citigroup Inc. before she took a job at Deutsche Bank AG following graduation. After heading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) research at HSBC Holdings Plc, she left in May to join Amazon.com Inc. as head of ESG engagement.\n\nI was a junior in college [in the late 1990s]. I did an internship with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity [a nonprofit that offers educational and career support to young people from underserved communities]. I went down to New York for the interview. I had interviewed before but had never had a very corporate job before. I expressed a preference for consulting. SEO actually gave me an offer for investment banking. The great thing about SEO is that you had essentially 200 interns who were people of color-Asian, Black, Latino, East Asian, and South Asian, a bunch of kids who were from all over the place.\n\nI never, ever thought that I would be in banking, never considered it. I had an information systems background. Banking seemed very much like, you know, the movie Wall Street . I didn't see a lot of me in the movie Wall Street.\n\nAnd so when I got the internship [at Citi] I was like, OK, well, let's give this a shot. Definitely not a world I considered.\n\nJared Johnson, 30, is the co-founder of the apparel brand Season Three Inc. He became a JPMorgan Chase & Co. associate in 2015 but decided to leave in 2017. This year he graduated with master's degrees from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and MIT's Sloan School of Management.\n\nI'm originally from St. Louis. I went to college at Purdue. I was paying a ton of money to go there, and I was going to have a ton of debt. I took this accounting class that was notorious for being the weed-out class. I did incredibly well in it. And afterward, I felt, maybe this just comes naturally to me. I was hyperdetermined and hyperfocused in a way that I'd be shocked if I could ever get back there again in life. I made everything about landing that job. I read every book. I did everything. So when I finally was placed [through SEO] in JPMorgan, I was very excited. I was like, This is my opportunity.\n\nI had a few suits at the time. I remember having this gray suit, a light gray suit, and then I probably had this black suit. And I remember showing up to JPMorgan, and everyone wears a dark blue suit. I didn't know that was the Wall Street look. Dark blue suit, white shirt, black shoes.\n\nI'm remembering a room, 10 to 12 people, all the Black interns. This one [older Black colleague] would invite everybody to this meeting. He basically would explain the fact that you were highly visible as a Black employee in the bank. And everything you did, good or bad, would be magnified: \"So if you're really good here, and you shine during the summer, a lot of people will notice it. And if you're really bad, or you mess up here and there, a lot of people will take notice of that.\"\n\nOne of the things he would say is that on the private-banking side \"your career trajectory was limited as a Black person. And the reason why was at a certain point it becomes about who you know. It's all personal relationships that matter. If you grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and you just happen to know a lot of people who have money, you could be successful, because you could call on your friends' parents and hopefully get some of them to become clients.\"\n\nHis argument was, you don't have that. You don't have that luxury. So you probably won't be able to generate business. You basically have a ceiling on your career in the private bank [and should] find roles in investment management.\n\nI get a phone call from someone in HR. If you were doing a movie, it was one of those highlights. You get the call, and you jump with joy. I made my entire college experience about getting this job. Now I had it.\n\nI invested in a closet full of dark blue suits and white shirts.\n\nAnré Williams, 55, is group president of American Express Co.'s global merchant and network services unit, which handles relationships with banks and merchants that accept AmEx around the world. Williams joined AmEx's marketing division full time in 1990 after interning at the company.\n\nI was the first person in my family to go to college, so I kind of learned as I went. [At Stanford,] I majored in economics, and I decided when I was an undergrad I wanted to work in business in some capacity. I wasn't sure what industry. I didn't know if it would be in accounting or in finance or in marketing or in sales or manufacturing. I wasn't sure, but I knew I wanted to work in business.\n\nI knew that at some point I may have to get an MBA if I wanted to be able to be equipped to excel at the highest levels of business.\n\nAt the time, I would often look for information, for inspiration, or for role models or people who had charted a path. I would look for books, or biographies, or newspaper articles, or magazine articles. One magazine I used to read often-cover to cover-was Black Enterprise , because it highlighted African-American executives or entrepreneurs who were successful in business.\n\nI read about Reginald Lewis, an entrepreneur who did one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the time. Or Barry Rand, who was an executive at Xerox in the late '80s and '90s. Or Ken Chenault, who was at American Express. Reading about people to inspire me, to see what their paths were. Where did they go to school? Where did they work before? What industries were they in? What did they major in? Those types of things. To get a sense of how they charted their path.\n\nI ended up working for a couple of years after undergrad and went to business school at Wharton. I majored in marketing when I was there and [minored in] real estate finance. I wasn't sure what company to join or what industry, but I knew [Wharton] would be great training. I wanted to work in product management and marketing for the summer, and American Express was one of the companies that offered me a summer internship. I joined for the summer and had a fantastic experience and ended up coming back to American Express full time, and I've been in the company ever since.\n\nChris White, 45, has worked for Salomon Smith Barney, MarketAxess, Barclays, and Goldman Sachs Group. He is the chief executive officer of advisory firm Viable Mkts LLC and BondCliQ, a centralized bond trading platform. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with BondCliQ in providing bond-price information.)\n\nI often say to people, \"I'm the least-educated person in my family.\" My parents both have master's degrees. My father had an MBA from Columbia that he got in the early '70s, and my mother has probably about four master's degrees in childhood education and in special education. So really, really well-educated.\n\nI went to [Phillips Academy] Andover for high school, and then I went to Brown University. I played basketball there. I didn't pursue graduate school or anything like that. I found my way to Wall Street because, you know, there's sort of a steady pipeline of Wall Street executives who played sports. I [took] the traditional Ivy League route: One of the basketball-playing alumni got me a job at Bear Stearns the summer after my freshman year. I was a horrible employee, because I'd never worked in an office before.\n\nThen my junior year, I got a summer job at Smith Barney. And it was just a magical summer. I really enjoyed the work. I was working in mortgage-backed support. The head of fixed income at that time was a Brown alumnus who'd played basketball and actually remains one of my mentors.\n\nOne of the things at the time-it was a huge thing: There was a Black trader working on the trading desk, a guy named Mike Baker. And so to me, it was like, well, if he can become a mortgage trader, then I can. You have to imagine going into an industry where you are so often the only one. That already sends a signal as to what's possible.\n\nThere's not a person today on Wall Street that is successful because they just came in and rocked it. It's not the way Wall Street works. You come into Wall Street, and then someone takes a vested interest in your success, and they help you.\n\nRacquel Oden: Women don't apply for jobs unless they feel like they have every qualification. Being a Black woman, I was committed to ensure there was no box I didn't check. I could do asset management, I could do wealth management, I could do investment banking, I could do retail, I could lead large organizations, I could run strategy, I could handle a P&L [profit and loss statement], I could focus on product distribution. I was going to have all the licenses, I was going to have all the degrees. And I think that was important to me to feel like I could be successful on Wall Street.\n\nI became chief of staff to the president of a pretty large organization at UBS. It happened based on me presenting at a meeting and someone seeing the work that I did and asking me if I would join their team.\n\nIt was just a normal executive update, and that day the president showed up-no one even knew he was going to be in the meeting. So it was never intentionally planned that way. But [I] was prepared for my topic, asked three or four very pointed questions, knew my numbers, knew how to respond, and he had heard about the reputation that I had and got to see it in action based on that meeting.\n\nSo does that happen often? No. But I think what's critical and important was that you had a senior person-a White male-who saw something in some way that said, \"I want that person on my team.\"\n\nYou need to be prepared at all moments, because you never know when \"that moment\" is. I wouldn't have known that that meeting was going to be \"the moment.\" I always bring 110%. I'm always overprepared, and I always want to make sure it's that level of quality at all times.\n\n[That job] gave me exposure at a very senior level to understanding large organizations and running them at the executive committee level. Today, leading an organization of 10,000 people, I obviously get to leverage [that].\n\nTessie Petion: At my internship at Citi, the MD [managing director] of the group was a woman, but six months into my career at Deutsche Bank, I moved to London where I worked on the trading floor, and quite consistently, I was the woman of color-rather, I should say, I was the Black woman. To everyone's credit, no one was blatantly racist to me.\n\nAt one of the banks I worked at there was a forum on diversity, and there was a presentation. They pulled together all of the diverse members of the team. It was divisionwide. Literally, I'm not exaggerating when I say it was me made to look like a collage of pictures. You could spot me in the class, several times. There was me, [and] an East Asian woman-she's actually Brazilian but of East Asian descent-and a South Asian man.\n\nWe played \"spot each other\" [on the] huge collage. I was on it at least three times, if not four. The East Asian woman was on it twice. The South Asian man was on it three times. And we said, \"OK, if you're thinking about putting together a diversity panel and you find yourself having to repeat the picture of someone, take a step back and think, OK, we might have a problem.\"\n\nIt was like, this is a celebration of diversity? And I just remember thinking, Do you not see the irony here? No. OK, great. Awesome.\n\n[SEO was] very good about putting us in front of senior people on Wall Street. There was a woman [Carla Harris], she works at Morgan Stanley. I think when I first met her, she was a director, and now she's an MD, and she's on the board of Walmart. They were very good about showing us that there are people who make it at senior levels. But at my firm, I didn't see that. I saw that it existed. I didn't see it every day.\n\nPeople assume a lot about me because I am Black. I have a friend who has worked on Wall Street for the last 17 years, does very well for himself. But people assume because he's Black he has a disadvantaged background or he's from some disadvantaged home in the area. None of that is true, but that's the assumption that's made. I think that people assume that they know everything there is to know about me because I'm a Black woman from Brooklyn, and I'm pleasantly surprised when that is not the case.\n\nPart of the moral of the story is that I am very, very, very used to being the only Black woman in places. At my first grad school, I was the only Black woman in my year-actually in both grad schools, I was the only Black woman. That's something that's not uncommon for the folks that end up sticking around on Wall Street.\n\nWe have to be supercareful about everything, because if it goes badly with me, then maybe the next time they look at a person of color then they're like, \"Well, we tried that one, right?\"\n\nThe thing that I say all the time to juniors [in the office] is it doesn't mean that you can't have a career, but you do have to know that [being supercareful] is the case all the time. I am being candid, but, I guess, to me, being Black on Wall Street is [being] someone who's a resilient person, who knows that they might get left out of some conversations but will find a way to get in that conversation anyway, right?\n\nSomething that I actually thought was weird: You know, on all these [PowerPoint] decks, here's my picture everywhere. But it probably helped in some ways socialize the idea that I'm the one coming in, that I'm the one that's leading the meeting, that I'm the one that sets the pace. A big part of that was who I worked with. My bosses at the end at HSBC, if we had a meeting in the U.S., it was my meeting. If someone tried to talk to them because they were men or non-Black, they'd be like, \"This is Tessie's meeting.\"\n\nJared Johnson: I had no connections to Wall Street. I didn't know anyone who worked for a bank. Outside of TV shows, movies, it really was just a figment of my imagination. When I was in college, I was reading the Wall Street Journal, reading the Financial Times, trying to educate myself as much as I could.\n\nI built this construct in my mind of what it was like to work on Wall Street. That construct really was that all of my colleagues, everybody I worked with, would be exceptionally smart, because the bar to get into the door was so high. I had a concept of all the forces that would work in the opposite direction of that: structural racism, unconscious bias, nepotism in some cases. I think I had a loose idea of how those things factor into a workplace like JPMorgan.\n\nBut I still expected a level of excellence and a level of intelligence. I would ask myself, Who interviewed this person? How did they get here? Because frankly they weren't that bright. Some people wouldn't even pass the test in my mind that they would be able to convince someone else of their brightness. And that flat-out surprised me.\n\n[But] you can't skate by at the same level of your White colleagues. You have to be excellent in order to succeed.\n\nMy expectation working there the whole time was if I'm going to walk into a room with 10 people, I'm probably going to be the only Black person there.\n\nI moved to a role that was more of a sales support role. I worked mainly with this one guy. He dressed very well, I guess, in a cheesy Wall-Street-guy way. He had nice watches and drove a Porsche. Slicked-back hair. I never liked him. And the feedback he would always give me was to be more vocal or more emotional. I would never have raised my voice, or showed any emotion, or cried at the office. His remark was, \"I can't even tell if you are enjoying what you're doing, or if you're happy, or celebrating.\"\n\n\"Fit\" was this subjective idea about what JPMorgan's culture is currently like. JPMorgan is very proud of the culture it has.\n\nWhat they were doing was almost training you to learn the language, learn the customs. We were taught and groomed how to operate in a White corporate world. People are very resistant to give up any elements, traditions of the White corporate American culture to make room for something that looks different.\n\nI landed on this team that called on independent investment advisers and ended up having a really great experience. My standing and stature grew, because I was in a position where I was highly valued. I felt I was in a space where I was given a lot of autonomy. I was respected and valued by the members on my team, and felt I was in this zone of growth.\n\nBy the time I left, I had a full beard, and my hair was much longer, and I was much more comfortable being closer to what I felt was myself at the office. I felt that was something I had to earn. I certainly felt I carved out more space to be myself and built a reputation with people that gave me more latitude to take risks and bring more of my full self to work. But I don't think, even at the end, I would be able to tell you that I felt at home.\n\nAnré Williams: Seeing people who you feel are like you or are similar to you-that you feel have done what you aspire to do-shows you that it can happen for you. It's a physical demonstration that it can be done. And I always say that if you can see it and you believe it, then you can achieve it.\n\nThat's, in a way, what Ken [Chenault, AmEx CEO from 2001 to 2018] was to me.\n\nJust imagine being 19 or 20 years old and reading about people that I didn't know that I thought did something amazing that I aspired to. Seeing Ken, among others, on the cover of Black Enterprise magazine at that age, it was really inspiring to me, because that told me that it was possible. It was hard. It would be difficult. But it was possible. And that's what it was.\n\nIt just so happens that I was placed in the same business unit as a marketing summer intern where Ken was. And knowing that the senior leaders in our business unit reported up to him and that I was working on PowerPoint presentations that he would ultimately review and decide on with them was something that was inspiring to me.\n\nI wanted to work in a company where I felt that I would get a fair shot. And some of the other companies I interviewed at-they were top-notch companies-but I wasn't convinced that they had enough diversity within the executive and senior ranks to make me feel that if I was there I would get a fair chance. Having Ken and others like him at American Express made me feel more comfortable joining the firm.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been injustices in the world and racial problems in America for hundreds of years. It's not anything new. And as someone who's African American and in the Black community, the way that my generation was taught was don't let those things get in the way of you trying to produce and excel and succeed. You can't let outside influences deter you, because it's a burden to carry. It's a lot to think about.\n\nAnd that's the part that's difficult, because you're taught to compartmentalize, to not let outside influences deter you from the path that you had inside of your corporate environment. And because of that, sometimes people don't bring their whole self to work. Over the years, you might not want to talk about how you truly feel about things going on, because you don't want to get into a divisive racial conversation with people in the workplace.\n\nYou just want to focus on the content-the content of whatever it is that you're doing. And it's difficult to do that. It's who you are and how you were born, and you're not able to ignore it, but then you're told to try to minimize it in some ways to try to make sure that you make people feel comfortable, that you're not consistent with whatever their stereotypes are. So you can try to focus on performance. And that's really the thing.\n\nSo these things come up like, you know, the Rodney King beating [by Los Angeles police in 1991]. It's not a topic that you look forward to discussing at work at all, because it gets you into a conversation with a lot of people who may not be well-informed, who may ask a lot of questions which are full of bias. It takes your energy away from the positivity you're trying to keep to excel in your business career.\n\nThat sometimes is unavoidable, because you're in a group discussion, and it comes up, and you have to deal with it. But it's not something that anybody that I knew, back in the early '90s, looked forward to discussing at work, because it was just a negative reminder about how unfair things are, and how they work, and unfortunately how they still are in America.\n\nO.J. Simpson and the Bronco chase and his trial-that was another difficult time, when in America every poll said that there was a difference in the way that White Americans saw that whole episode and the way Black Americans saw it. You didn't really want to talk about it at work in a group of people, unless you had to, because there were very different views about it.\n\nChris White: There's a theme here to the problems with being Black on Wall Street. It's a problem of perception. You're perceived in ways that are unrecognizable from how you perceive yourself. That's where the problem really starts.\n\nThat manifests itself in two very clear ways: It manifests itself in benefit of the doubt, and it manifests itself in terms of leadership opportunities. Two people could be saying the exact same thing. In one case, someone's given the benefit of the doubt. They're believed. They're trusted. In another case, they're doubted. They're not listened to. They're not heard. And it's painfully obvious to you when you're not.\n\n[At Smith Barney] it was all great until there was a merger with Salomon Brothers, and everybody I knew from that mortgage desk got fired. And then they moved me. I wanted to stay in fixed income, so I ended up landing on the municipal side of the business.\n\nBy the way, a lot of Black people get put into munis.\n\nIt's the sort of unwritten rule on Wall Street, because there are minority mandates around new deals for munis. That's always been an area of the market where you have more Black representation.\n\nSo that's where I really started to get my first taste of what it's like to be Black on Wall Street. I was on the institutional sales desk, and I'm not blameless. I was a young kid. There's also quite a bit of hazing sometimes, especially when I was coming up in the late '90s. One day I responded back to someone hazing. I don't know what I said. I probably snapped back and said something.\n\nI got pulled into a room the next day by the head of the desk, [who] told me that the person I responded to felt physically threatened by me. I've never been in a fistfight in my life, so to hear that somebody felt physically threatened-this is what I mean by benefit of the doubt.\n\nPhysically threatened? I guess because it was coming from me, the head of the desk deemed it important to actually have a one-on-one conversation with me about it. And the messaging I got from that wasn't, \"Hey, you were physically threatening to someone.\" The message I got was, \"Watch the way you stand up for yourself.\"\n\nIt was so shocking for me. It really soured me, too. I left soon after that, because I got a job to trade at a hedge fund. That was sort of short-lived, because the dot-com bubble burst, and Sept. 11 happened, and the market became something totally different.\n\nElectronic trading and innovation in the bond market became something that I was obsessed with. I worked for a startup that then became public, and from there, I ended up moving over to the sell side, going back to traditional Wall Street. But I was going back not as a salesperson or trader. I was going back as someone who was supposed to be leading innovation.\n\nSometimes you're in the room, and you might be invisible. One time, I was in the room, and we were talking about a vendor, and the head of sales didn't like the CEO of this vendor, and he said, \"I wouldn't trust that brown fork-tongued devil farther than I could throw him.\" Now, I'm there, so I can't imagine what's being said when I'm not in the room. And it just sends a message to you. There's locker room talk, and we all get it. But it definitely, definitely sends a message.\n\nI was lucky enough to eventually, through another major merger, work for a guy who was really well-respected on Wall Street. The business at the time had asked him to write a plan around modernization of the global credit desk. I ended up writing probably about 80% of that plan. He presented it. He ended up leaving, but before he left, he went to the business, and he said, \"Listen, Chris White wrote that plan. I didn't really write it.\"\n\nHe did something very kind. He actually validated my contribution. See, that's something that is very frustrating, that some people don't recognize about the perception issue. I needed a White guy to validate me with other White guys, because there's no way I could have been validated just on my contribution alone.\n\nThere comes a time in any job when you want to be valued as an employee. You've got to take your boss aside, and you've got to say, \"This is what my expectation is. How do I get there?\" So, I took my new boss aside: \"This all has to do with perception of value. I wrote the plan. I'm implementing the plan.\" My ask isn't outrageous, and [yet] he's telling me I should probably look for another job.\n\nIf I stay in a place where my boss says something like that to me, whose responsibility is it? Whose problem is it? That's my fault.\n\nI was incredibly optimistic about the next place I was going to, because here was a big quote-unquote important dealer. They'd hired me to do a job that was on the cutting edge. I was one of the few people in the world that could do it. And I'm sitting there, and I'm saying, This is going to be great. I'm going to have a fantastic career. I'm starting out as a VP, I'll go to MD, and who knows what's after that.\n\nI remember saying to my wife, \"This new place that I work at, I think they have more Black traders and Black salespeople than all of the other Tier 1 dealers combined.\"\n\nWe're not quota people on Wall Street, [but] we are consistently viewed that way.\n\nOne time, I had my boss speaking to me, and I just was drifting off because of the way he was speaking to me. I was thinking to myself, \"You know what? If we matched résumés right now, in terms of just academic accomplishments and all of those things, I would trump yours. In fact, I bet you if we matched our parents' résumés, my parents would trump your parents. And I bet you if we matched our grandparents' résumés-because my grandfather was an appellate court judge-it would probably trump your grandparents. But you're speaking to me as if somehow, I snuck my way in here.\"\n\nThere is something really maddening where people seem to judge whether or not you're worthy of being there without ever looking at you with objectivity. If you wanted to look at me objectively, I was just like all those guys are on the floor. I was a boarding school guy. I was an Ivy League guy. There's only one thing different [about] me [and] anybody else.\n\nI really hit my stride there. And I ended up building some really cool stuff. Not once was I ever considered for promotion or for leadership.\n\nThere was a seminal moment that made me realize that no matter what I did at this bank, I was never going to move forward. This is what happened. Because of what I have built in the bond market, I developed a bit of a name. One day my phone rings, and it's someone representing the European Union, [from] a regulatory body out of Brussels. They say, \"Hey, we've heard about you. We know that you are an expert in bond market liquidity. We would love for you to come to Brussels and give a talk on this to our group.\"\n\nCan you imagine how hard it is to become recognized to the point where you get a cold call from the head of a f---ing European regulatory body? You've got to really be doing some stuff.\n\nAnyway, I bring it to whatever sort of organization internally [is required] to evaluate these things. They're like, \"This is awesome-we love doing favors for regulators, which is always good relationship building. Let's have a meeting.\" In the meeting, I'm explaining what the problem is. I'm leading the meeting. And then it seems that at the end of the meeting, the takeaway is: Chris White, can you please write up the talking points?\n\nAt that time, there's nobody in the bank on this topic of bond market liquidity that would be more informed than me. I don't care what their title was. I don't care how long they have been there.\n\nI write the talking points.\n\nThey sent someone else. If I can't represent this bank on a topic that not only in this bank, but probably worldwide I'm a recognized expert in, then when can I represent the bank? But it's really f---ing hard, man, to explain to me why I didn't get the look to go.\n\nWall Street has a problem with Black excellence. And what I mean by Black excellence is most supersuccessful people in Wall Street or in industry are just really excellent at stuff. That's how they got there, right? That's how they did it. But when someone's excellent as a Black person, as a trader, or as a salesperson, or in my role as a strategist, as an inventor, it's not embraced.\n\nI'm randomly walking on the floor about two weeks later, and one of the few Black partners pulls me aside. I don't know this guy. I know him by name. But I don't really know him. And he says, \"Chris, your bosses wanted me to speak to you. I actually don't understand what the problem is. I've observed you being a really capable guy. I thought that maybe you would lean on me for how to navigate here as a Black person. You never seem to need me. I've actually found that quite refreshing. And I saw that you knew your s---. And I was like, I thought that they would love you. For some reason, they don't like you.\"\n\nNow, that said two things to me. One, it told me that my bosses perceived my issue as being a Black issue. Why? Because they sent a Black guy to randomly talk to me. Why didn't they send one of the partners in the business that I worked in every day? They sent him. Imagine you were the only Jewish guy at a firm. Imagine you were the only gay person at a firm or the only woman at a firm. And the random person that comes to talk to you about what's going on happens to be Jewish, or gay, or a woman.\n\nThe other thing that it told me-this was a very profound thing-they don't like me. And what they don't like about me is the way that I make them feel. The only thing I can imagine is what they did not like from me is the level of confidence I have around my content and my natural desire and leadership abilities. They didn't like that. Now, what's amazing about that is like other people, depending on what they look like, those are the intangibles that they make you a partner. And so, again, I'm responsible for my own career, so I know I got to go.\n\nRacquel Oden: I call this moment hopeful. And I am superhopeful. I believe, truly believe, that this is a moment that feels so different this time, and that it can be different. I'm committed to making it real, personally. And I think that's what we all have to say, right? We've got to hope and believe, and then we have to be committed to making it real.\n\nI would probably push a little further on mentors and sponsors. A mentor is that person that you can bounce an idea [off of], get some advocacy from. But what's really critical is sponsorship-that senior executive that's going to be your advocate whether you are in the room or not and who is looking at you as the next talent.\n\nIf you can't find yourself in your organization, that's why outside networks are extremely important. Certainly [that's the case] in my own personal cabinet of senior executives that look like me, other Black females and Black males. You've got to be able to speak to others who understand the things that you're going through that are specific to what they're experiencing as well. You can't look in one place for it. I think you have to have that circle of trust.\n\nIf we think about where we were as Blacks on Wall Street, that number hasn't improved. If you think about where we are as Black females on Wall Street, that number certainly hasn't improved. So statistically it hasn't changed.\n\nBut is the conversation different, and do we feel this could be a turning point where we can finally change the statistics? I think that's what's different. And I think that's what's going to be really critical as we think about this moment. How do we make this moment more than a moment, where we actually have what I call sustainable change and real impact, so we're not repeating statistics again?\n\nI would tell my younger self, \"You're going to find it harder, you're going to work harder, you're going to experience more obstacles, but your persistence and drive and faith are going to allow you to have a journey that will make it better for your daughter and girls that are coming behind you.\" And I'd end it with, \"I see you. I see you.\" -Kelsey Butler\n\nTessie Petion: Wall Street is not doing a good enough job thinking about why people fall out. We expect juniors to fall out, but midcareer? That's the vulnerability for many people. Why are people falling out midcareer? I think that 100% can be improved. If you're midcareer, it either means you were a junior and kept at it, or it means you came in post-business school. But either way, that's the point in your career where you're likely to stay somewhere for maybe five, six years.\n\nPost-financial crisis, if you are a junior and you have offers from an investment bank and a tech company, I think at this point you're more likely to pick the tech company. Amazon is 26 years old, and nothing we do is \"because we did this 20 years ago.\"\n\nThe whole point of diversity-the proof case of diversity-is that you have people that come to the table with different experiences. I think about systemic inequality, because maybe it's something I might have experienced. So I push you to think about it differently. It's hard, though. I didn't sense the pushback was because I was a Black woman. I think the pushback is because Wall Street doesn't historically think deeply.\n\nThat's what ESG tries to change. But 20 years ago, if I tried to have that [ESG] conversation at an investment bank, they would have laughed me out of the room. I don't think it's different because of who I am. I think it is because status quo works, right?\n\nObviously, I got hired at a very senior level at Amazon. Now I am [a mentor]. And to be fair, I was that person for several people at HSBC. I can say that I think that there were lots of juniors who saw me there and thought, OK, maybe I can do this, right? Yes. And so I did think about that a lot when I left. I'm the person, and I'm leaving. What does that mean? How did they interpret that?\n\nThe VP of customer fulfillment-obviously that's a big deal for Amazon-is a Black woman. I looked at the person who does transportation, and that's a Black man. Anyone who is a VP at Amazon is someone who could be a CEO of a smaller company. I looked and said, Can I see myself on that trajectory? I think I can. But I was really conscious of the fact that by leaving the bank, I was one less person that modeled, \"This is how you can do Wall Street at HSBC.\"\n\nI was lucky to only sort of bookend my career [in finance]. I was a junior, and then I came back in supersenior. And so that's really specific to my career. For sure there have been people that have been allies that have been really helpful.\n\nAt the bank, there have been people that have said, \"I'm looking out for you and making sure that you have all of the [opportunities] possible.\" One hundred percent that happened to me at HSBC. It's what put me into the room. I guess my expertise did it. But also you had people that said, \"Hey, I want to make sure you find this person.\" You always need that first opportunity in order to get the rest of them. -Gillian Tan\n\nJared Johnson: The summer at the bank would look different than the winter at the bank, because there were a lot more young Black people [interning]. [But they] didn't get offers.\n\nI did internalize a lot of those messages to be a nonthreatening Black person to White people. As traditional as they come: That's the idea. Wear a suit. Present yourself this way, so people don't feel a sense that this is uncomfortable. You don't want to look like you're overindulging.\n\nIt was all of these rules. The way I would describe it is \"respectability strategy.\" It's this idea of, if you can show up and show proof that you're more professional, more buttoned-up, more polished, than your peers, then you'll overcome whatever challenges are thrown your way. Because you don't fit the stereotypes of what people think about Black people. -Max Abelson\n\nAnré Williams: People still say in the workplace, \"Don't talk about race, don't talk about religion, don't talk about politics.\" And people try to do that. But I think what's happened now in [the aftermath of George Floyd's death] is that we've gotten to a point where people know they can't remain silent.\n\nRemaining silent in a way is almost an implicit acknowledgment that you're OK with the way things are and you're just going to ignore it. And people aren't comfortable ignoring it anymore or allowing it to be ignored. And that's what's different right now, I think.\n\nYou want people to feel comfortable being who they are at work and being comfortable doing that. I think as the years have gone by, more and more people are encouraged to do that. Whether it's someone's sexual preference or orientation, whether it's gender, whether it's religion-I mean, people are encouraged to be a little bit more open and forthright about who they are and what their needs or expectations are. And I think that's a good thing, because that's a big part of their life. It's who they are, and that shouldn't take away from the talent and what they can produce.\n\nOver the years, I was involved in campus recruiting and making sure that-if I wanted the company to have diversity-I should be one of the people to go on campus. With what happened [this year], it just struck a chord with me that things were really, really bad. And I just didn't feel that I could remain silent. I wanted to be able to say something to all of our Black employees [1,400 or so] in our network in the United States. And I wanted them to hear from me directly.\n\nA few people reached out to me and said they were going through a lot, and they thought it was really difficult. And so I just wanted them to hear from me. I want to share my feelings. I want them to know that I found the recent instance to be horrific, to be inexcusable, and to be maddening.\n\nBut I also wanted to share personally that at times I feel terrified about the things that could happen to me or to my friends or to my relatives or to my son in a world which sometimes is completely unpredictable. You just don't know how things can go sideways sometimes when they shouldn't. The point I was trying to make to all of them [in an internal video] is that everybody is going through a lot emotionally, but they need to remain positive.\n\nThe video ended up being shared internally by other leaders with their teams. I think people were surprised that it was personally coming from me and it was a personal perspective, because usually I stay focused on the business side and this was really how I feel about this personally.\n\nIt's not like this has never happened before, as if there's no one that's ever lost their life as a result of law enforcement being too forceful. It happened with Eric Garner here in New York City. It happened with Philando Castile [in Falcon Heights, Minn.]. It's happened before. But I think the difference this time is that you're in the middle of a global health crisis, a global pandemic where everyone in most large cities around the world was required to shelter at home.\n\nSo, parents are having to be at home with their kids in the house, sheltering, not sure what's next. In that environment, we have a lot of emotion, a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress, a lot of uncertainty. Everyone's watching television, watching the news, on social media and online.\n\nAnd then we see these incidents that are happening, and they just get people really upset. It just reminds you that there is racial inequality. That was where I think people finally said enough is enough. And the demonstrations and the protests didn't just happen in Minneapolis where it started. They had gone global. And when you look at the images of the people who were demonstrating, they weren't just Black Americans, right? That was the key to me.\n\nThe key was it wasn't just Black Americans. It was all races, all ages. And it wasn't just U.S. It was global. And to me, that's so different than anything we've ever experienced before. This time just felt very, very different. -Jenny Surane\n\nChris White: It's 2020, and you're like, \"Wait, how many Black MDs are there at this global investment bank?\" And you're shocked by the number. That's because during '08 or '09-or any year you can pick that wasn't such a good year-we definitely feel more susceptible to being let go.\n\nI'll tell you something I observed. One of the biggest accounts on Wall Street for fixed income as a salesperson is an annuity, because they're just so big in the volume that they do that you always look like a big producer. Most of the people who are running sales desks or are MDs and things like that, they're people who cover those accounts.\n\nThis young African-American guy wasn't young-he was like 26, 27-he was the backup coverage on this account. The lead coverage got moved to a different desk. And so they hadn't figured out who the new coverage was going to be. As the backup coverage, he's doing all of the work.\n\nAnd here's the thing: This is what I mean about when the leadership opportunities come. Here, through natural circumstance, [is] a leadership opportunity where this 27-, 28-year-old kid could be covering this account. That would make him the biggest producer on the desk. Do they let him cover the account? No. They pulled [in] some partner, like out of semiretirement, and that partner covers the account with him remaining as the backup.\n\nHere's how the story would have been different: They let him cover the account. He knocks the cover off the ball. He then gets fast-tracked to MD. He then becomes the head of the desk at 33 or 34, because he looks like such a frickin' superstar.\n\nIt's a little butterfly effect, things like that. When people ask me, how come there's so few desk heads or MDs in this space that are Black? It's stuff like that.\n\nWhy everyone's interested in this topic right now is George Floyd and police brutality. That's a perception issue, too. That's perceiving someone as a threat or being violent or as a criminal just on sight.\n\nOn Wall Street, it's being perceived as not being competent or being too aggressive or not being worthy of leadership based on sight, not on any of the other evidence around you. As a Black professional on Wall Street, you have to figure out how to deal with that.\n\nHere's the last thing: So I'm very happy with my career. I'm not angry about any of this. Are there times where it makes me slightly frustrated hearing some of the bulls---? Yes, of course. But this is not isolated within Wall Street.\n\nSo now I'm a tech entrepreneur. Look at my résumé. I worked for one of the most successful fixed-income startups in the history of fixed-income startups. I worked at some of the most prestigious dealers. I have patents in my name for platforms that I've built as the lead inventor.\n\nThe problems with perception definitely impact my ability to raise money. No question about it. You have to ask yourself a question, and this is a real question: If Mark Zuckerberg was Jamal Zuckerberg, would Facebook exist?\n\nIt goes back to that benefit of the doubt. Is it possible that someone could have seen a Black kid who didn't graduate from Harvard in a hoodie and sneakers and jeans and looked at him and said, \"I believe that he's really onto something here\"? -Matthew Leising\n\nButler covers private credit in New York.

According to the suit, they were the only Black passengers on the flight.\n\nEmmanuel Jean Joseph, Alvin Jackson and Xavier Veal - the three plaintiffs- were on a connecting flight from Los Angeles. The three allege that at no point throughout the other flight did any employee from American Airlines say anything to them about an offensive odor.\n\nJean Joseph told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that as he gathered his belongings and walked to the jet bridge, he noticed that only Black men were being removed from the flight.\n\n\"I started freaking out,\" Xavier Veal said. He decided to record the incident on his phone.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the men were held in the jetway for about an hour and then moved to the gate area where they were told they would be rebooked on another flight to New York later that day. The lawsuit alleges that an American Airlines employee indicated that the complaint about body odor came from a \"white male flight attendant.\"\n\nA gate agent seen in the video at one point seemed to agree that race was a factor in the decision to remove the men from the flight.\n\nWhen another flight to New York could not be found, the men were put back on the same plane. Jackson described the experience as uncomfortable, saying, \"Everybody staring at me, me and all the other Black people on the plane were just taken off.\"\n\n\"I knew that as soon as I got on that plane, a sea of White faces were going to be looking at me and blaming me for their late flight of an hour,\" said Jean Joseph.\n\nThe lawyer representing the three men, Sue Huhta, a partner at Outten & Golden, said that American Airlines declined to provide her clients any answers about the incident and said it seems \"fairly apparent that race was part of this dynamic.\"\n\n\"It's almost inconceivable to come up with an explanation for that other than the color of their skin, particularly since they didn't know each other and weren't sitting near each other,\" said Huhta.\n\nThe lawsuit also cites other recent incidents where passengers have alleged discrimination by American Airlines and references a 2017 NAACP travel advisory urging members not to fly on the airline, which was lifted eight months later.\n\nCBS legal analyst Rikki Klieman said the lawsuit suggests that the plaintiffs might be more interested in making a public statement about racial discrimination than in financial compensation. Klieman believes the question at trial is about American Airlines' protocols and how it handled the employees after the incident.\n\nBut Veal said he believes that if it had been a White person, the situation probably wouldn't have happened.\n\n\"We were discriminated against. The entire situation was racist,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, American Airlines said, \"We take all claims of discrimination very seriously and want our customers to have a positive experience when they choose to fly with us. Our teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people.\"\n\nEmmy Award-winning journalist Kris Van Cleave is the senior transportation correspondent for CBS News based in Phoenix, Arizona, where he also serves as a national correspondent reporting for all CBS News broadcasts and platforms.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Boston panel weighs in.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 24, 2024 / 11:47 AM EDT / CBS Boston\n\nROXBURY - It's crunch time for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as Election Day is less than two weeks away. The Harris campaign is still working to win over some Black male voters as the election approaches, and a panel discussion in Boston shed some light on possible reasons why.\n\nJames Lambert III has been working to find the answer to why some Black voters are hesitant to vote for Harris.\n\n\"A number of Black men are not voting for Kamala Harris, despite her being identified as the Black candidate. Why?\" Lambert said.\n\nIt's a question Harris has been working to answer herself in the last few weeks leading up to the 2024 election in hopes of securing a White House win.\n\nIt was also one of the questions posed at Wednesday night's intimate panel discussion in Roxbury hosted by Lambert, the moderator and curator.\n\n\"Let's keep it real, men are not voting for her because she's a woman,\" panelist Cleon Byron said.\n\n\"I'm not voting for her because I don't agree with her policies,\"  panelist Antonio Miles responded.\n\n\"I don't think she has campaigned well,\" panelist Will Onuoha said.\n\n\"This event started with a conversation about how do we raise funds for Kamala Harris and instead of just doing a fundraiser, I felt like we had to have an earnest conversation,\" Lambert said.\n\nThe panel made up of five Black men, from across the political spectrum, voiced opinions and concerns about Harris' prosecutorial record:\n\n\"Her job is to prosecute those who were brought before her and [provide] balance of justice. Myself, I don't see anything wrong with that,\" panelist Dana \"Supreme\" Richardson said.\n\nImmigration and Harris' heritage were also topics of discussion.\n\n\"Black means different things to different sets of Black people,\" Onuoha said to the room before diving deeper into the conversation.\n\n\"Her question of being Black, African-American, all that, is just noise out there. It doesn't change anything that she's trying to do for the American people,\" another attendee of the forum said.\n\nHarris has made what some would call non-traditional stops on the campaign trail to reach Black men, including a sit - down with Breakfast Club host, Charlamagne Tha God. Former President Barack Obama also hit the trail to urge Black men to vote for Harris.\n\nHarris recently announced an Opportunity Plan for Black men, saying she plans to earn their votes.\n\nWhen asked what he hopes people walk away with, Lambert replied, \"We want folks to walk away challenging how they came into the space.\"\n\n\"We have to have this conversation if we're going to have change,\" Byron said.\n\n\"I think if we did this quarterly, that would be really good,\" Onuoha said.\n\nCourtney Cole joined WBZ-TV in 2022 as an anchor and reporter after spending four years in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\n© 2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "Black men have lowest melanoma survival rate compared to other races, study finds\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  August 7, 2023 / 7:43 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nMen with melanoma, particularly Black men, are more likely to die than women with melanoma, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nComparing data from the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2018, the analysis of more than 200,000 people found the 5-year survival rate in men with melanoma was highest for White men, at around 75%, compared to Black men, who ranked the lowest, with a survival rate of 52%. American Indian/Alaskan Native (69%), Asian (68%) and Hispanic (66%) men fell in between.\n\nThe study also showed that men of color were more likely to have melanoma diagnosed at an advanced stage, making it more difficult to treat. Even when adjusted for factors like income level and insurance coverage, Black race alone increased mortality risk compared to the White population, the study found.\n\nMelanoma causes more than 9,000 deaths per year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC data also show rates of male mortality for melanoma, of all races, are more than double that of females of all races.\n\n\"We know that men may be less likely to seek medical care than women, so they can be diagnosed with melanoma at later stages,\" dermatologist and co-author of the study Ashley Wysong, founding chair of the Department of Dermatology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said in a news release . \"However, even after accounting for later stages at diagnosis, men still have worse overall survival rates than women with melanoma, so we suspect that there are some unmeasured social, genetic, tumor-specific and potentially biological factors at play, such as hormones and the way the immune system responds to melanoma tumors.\"\n\nDr. Alix Charles, chairman of dermatology at Duly Health and Care, told CBS News, \"Unfortunately Black Americans are less likely to carry private insurance. They're less likely to be able to have access to quality healthcare in their neighborhoods and in their communities.\"\n\nIf detected early, the five-year survival rate for melanoma is 99%, according to the American Cancer Society. But that figure drops down to 32% once the melanoma has spread to other organs.\n\nWhile it has been known that skin cancer is increasing among all Americans , with specific rises in men and people of color, this is the largest study to date to look specifically at the role of race among men with melanoma.\n\n\"We hope our research can lay the foundation for future studies to determine why there's such a gap in survival rates, and to make headway to reduce these survival rate gaps,\" Wysong said.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology says to reduce your risk, wear sunscreen and sun-protective clothing and watch for changes to your skin.\n\n\"If you have a spot on your skin that has looked the same your whole life and suddenly the edges might look different or the color changes, if the size changes, that's an important factor,\" Dr. Maral Kibarian Skelsey, dermatologist and director of the Dermatologic Surgery Center of Washington, previously told CBS News.\n\nIt's also recommended that everyone above age 18 get an annual skin examination.\n\nDetroit Lions defensive lineman Josh Paschall was a sophomore playing for the University of Kentucky when he saw a strange mark on the bottom of his foot. It turned out to be a rare form of melanoma, and Paschall needed multiple surgeries and immunotherapy to remove it.\n\n\"If you see anything that's abnormal, get that checked out,\" he told CBS News.\n\n\"The thing that's unique about skin cancer - it's so common, but it's also so preventable,\" Dr. Elizabeth Hale, associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone and senior vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation previously told CBS News.\n\nAbout 90% of skin cancers are associated with sun exposure, which makes protection important, Hale added.\n\n\"We recommend a broad spectrum SPF 30 or higher, and it's important to think about sunscreen every single day. It's not just enough when going to the beach or pool because we know that some damage is cumulative,\" she says. \"When you're outside, you want to reapply every two hours - even more if you're sweating or swimming. Getting people to wear it every day is the real goal.\"\n\n- Errol Barnett contributed reporting.\n\nSara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

Can he keep the momentum in 2024?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  May 11, 2024 / 7:31 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nJames Butler, a Black, 42-year-old Atlanta-based Democrat, is planning on casting his ballot for President BIden in November -   but he isn't so enthusiastic this time around.\n\n\"I guess it's the best we got,\" he said about the 2024 election.\n\nButler's not alone among Black voters in Georgia in his lack of enthusiasm in voting for Mr. Biden for a second time.\n\nA CBS News poll in late February showed 76% of likely Black voters said they backed his reelection bid, down from 87% who voted for him in 2020. In 2020, Georgia was one of Mr. Biden's closest victories, with fewer than 12,000 voters making the difference - and Black voters were a key part of Mr. Biden's winning coalition there.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears to have taken notice. Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday kicked off a multistate tour in Atlanta, to talk about investments in Black communities and opportunities for minority families to build wealth under the Biden administration.\n\n\"We're going to keep talking about the record and the work that is being done to advance the economic opportunity for young Black men across this country,\" said Michael Tyler, a campaign spokesperson.\n\nOrganizers with the New Georgia Project, a Black voter advocacy group based in Atlanta, believe younger males have been particularly slow to return to Mr. Biden's fold.\n\n\"Young Black men are more likely to say that they will vote for Trump,\" said Ranada Robinson, a researcher for the New Georgia Project. \"But, what I am most concerned about this year is that about 30% was undecided at the time of our poll.\"\n\nRobinson says misinformation is playing a large role in the waning interest of some Black men in Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Particularly online, there are some narratives that misplace the credit for some of the wins that we've seen in America,\" she said. \"There's also some misplacement of blame. When you see certain Supreme Court decisions or some of the things that have long term impacts of past administrations, this administration is suffering the consequences of it.\"\n\nBut other supporters of the president say they just aren't excited about a 2020 rematch.\n\n\"I think my vote's the same, but I'm less enthusiastic,\" said Phillip Dunwood, 21, a student at Georgia State University. \"It's more like, 'alright, let's get it over with'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are looking to peel Black men off Mr. Biden's base, but they don't have the resources they had in previous cycles. The RNC's Black American Community Center in College Park, Georgia was one of many minority outreach centers that opened ahead of the 2022 midterms that are now shuttered.\n\n\"We can do a better job [at outreach],\" said Azad Ahmadi, a member of the Georgia Black Republican Council (GABRC).\n\nIn lieu of national infrastructure, the party is relying on local ancillary groups like the GABRC to make inroads with the Black community. Darryl Wilson, another member, says the group is using mentorship as a way to court Black men into considering voting for Republicans in November.\n\n\"We've done Black conservative summits. We've done 'barbershop-political forums.' We bring government to the people in the local communities, wherever they can ask direct questions and get direct answers,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe Black Conservative Federation (BCF), a network of African American GOP activists, rolled out its 2024 get out the vote policy plan in April titled \"Black Men Matter.\" The plan will see the group's outreach organizers targeting Black men in six battleground states - Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania - through grassroots outreach and programming.\n\nBut Democrats say Republicans are still far away from proving their investment in Black communities.\n\n\"To come around in an election period and suggest that they're courting Black voters, except to say 'Democrats aren't doing enough' or to say 'you should stay out of this because this election isn't worth getting involved in and Trump was a little bit better for you are the National Party was a little bit better for you,' I just don't buy it,\" said Anre Washington, a Georgia voter. \"It's not ever been in my voting lifetime, a good faith effort on the part of the Republican Party.\"\n\nTaurean Small is a congressional reporter for CBS News.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

When he was in high school, Watson took mentoring classes from OneGoal. Their mentoring program helped him get into college and succeed now that he's there.\n\n\"I think mentorship allows for people to see different paths in which they wouldn't see,\" Watson said.\n\nBarrington Price, CEO of Dominican University's Chicago campus, said \"The university system hasn't necessarily been designed historically for marginalized communities to experience success,:\n\nPrice said Watson is a good example of the benefits of mentoring.\n\n\"Mentoring is really helping students become aware of their skills and interests, their abilities; and navigating that into some career trajectory,\" he said.\n\nOneGoal offers mentoring classes at more than 30 public schools in Chicago.\n\n\"Sadly, there's an overlap between race and resources. So Black students are far more likely to attend low-income or high-poverty schools,\" said OneGoal CEO Melissa Connelly. \"But if we can make sure students have the knowledge about which colleges are best, which colleges have the programs that lead to the careers that they want, which certification programs can open up the most job opportunities for them, then students make good decisions.\"\n\nDecisions that could one day lead Watson to the White House.\n\n\"The OneGoal mentorship gave me an idea and the concept of it's okay to reach out, it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to receive help from others, and you don't have to rely on yourself to do everything,\" Watson said.\n\nOneGoal's mentorship programs are available to all students regardless of gender or ethnicity. It offers classes across the nation .\n\nJermont Terry joined the CBS 2 team in October 2019. He's born and raised on Chicago's South Side.

While he's also energized to vote in this election, he is concerned that some younger voters may not be.\n\n\"I really see that when you are speaking with younger people -- that being 18 to less than like 29 -- people tend to not be too involved in it because they think that it doesn't really involve them,\" he said.\n\nThe real estate agent is urging his peers to get out and vote.\n\n\"I think it's a lot about getting younger people to understand what are the things that are gonna affect us,\" McNeal said. \"Might it be in this four-year term or how these things that we do decide on in this term affect us in the next maybe eight years down the line, 12 years down the line.\"\n\nStephen Pugh from Palmyra, New Jersey, said: \"The best way I can explain it [the election], concerned.\"\n\nPugh, 52, has been voting since he became old enough to vote but is feeling a bit of election anxiety.\n\n\"I'm concerned,\" he said. \"You know I remember a time -- I've been voting for approximately 30 years and voting was so simple,\" Pugh said. \"You make your decision, you wait for the results. Either your person's gonna win or not win...fast forward to today.\"\n\nHe said he's uncomfortable with the harsh rhetoric and more politically divisive climate the country has seen in recent years.\n\n\"I'm hoping everyone realizes the importance -- whoever you vote for is whoever you vote for. But you need to know who you're voting for and why,\" Pugh said.\n\nRecent polls have shown some reservation among Black male voters, but in a recent CBS News poll, 87% of likely Black voters would choose Harris over Trump.\n\nPhiladelphia is the most populous voting area in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Even former President Barack Obama made a blunt appeal to Black male voters at a campaign stop in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"I can't say that I'm seeing it in my community, but I do hear it,\" said Eugene Phillips from Germantown. \"And in truth, I don't really understand it because when I think of Black men and the Black men that I know, I don't know of any Black man who can't look at, or doesn't have a strong Black woman who they are associated with either in their home or their community.\"\n\nThese avid voters will be heading to the polls  without reservation on issues that they say matter most to them.\n\n\"I look at the war that's going on between Russia and Ukraine, I look at health care which is a big thing,\" said Brandon Stiff from Elkins Park. \"I think economic issues are important. Starting a business or being able to improve upward mobility.\"\n\nSixty-six-year-old Eugene Golson said he'll be at the polls when they open on Election Day.\n\n\"I'll be number one,\" Golson said. \"Actually my wife will be number one because... but I'll be number two that's our plan and that's always our plan to be first and second.\"\n\n\"I vote because I really feel that it is truly part of what makes me an active citizen in America. And also, I know that there have been so many things that the people who have come before me had to do in order for us to have and ensure the right to vote,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"The message is clear - Black men need to be more involved on a day-to-day basis in their local and national politics,\" he added.\n\nNatasha Brown is the co-anchor of CBS News Philadelphia at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Prior to August 2018, the Emmy-Award winner was the weekend evening anchor of CBS News Philadelphia on CBS and Philly57.\n\n© 2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "Black men say they feel ignored by politicians. A historic Senate face-off between two Black men isn't helping\n\nAaron Bethea says he has voted election after election for US presidents, governors and senators - and yet those lawmakers have done little to nothing to improve life for him, his family or his community.\n\nBethea said he believes the issues he cares about, financial freedom and equal investment in predominately Black schools, have largely been ignored.\n\n\"Where we are from, nobody really cares about what Black men think,\" said Bethea, an Atlanta father of six who owns a wholesale company that sells televisions. \"They don't do anything for us.\"\n\nBethea, 40, said he still plans to vote Democratic in Georgia's hotly contested gubernatorial and US Senate races. But he's not voting with enthusiasm. He said he is hoping that one day someone will prioritize the needs of Black men.\n\nBethea is not alone. Political analysts, researchers and Black male leaders say politicians are failing to reach some Black men with messaging that resonates with them and visibility in their communities. Those shortcomings could particularly hurt Democrats in the upcoming midterms given Black men are the second most loyal voting bloc for the party next to Black women, experts say.\n\nAnd while Black men have increasingly supported Republicans in recent years, some say the GOP is still missing the mark. Many Black men say they are concerned that Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker does not represent them in a positive light given his many public gaffes , history of domestic violence and being an absentee father .\n\nPolitical analysts worry that the lack of effective messaging could result in Black men sitting home on Nov. 8 and Democrats like Stacey Abrams - who has made a late attempt to reach Black men with a series of events -  losing their races.\n\n\"If some of them feel unmotivated because they don't feel spoken to then you've really got a problem,\" said Jason Nichols, a professor of African American studies at the University of Maryland College Park. \"A lot of these campaigns don't hire Black male advisers. They don't hire Black men to actually tell them how to reach Black men.\"\n\nSo far, 39% of Black voters have been men, and 61% have been women, according to Catalist, a company that provides data and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and gives insights into who is voting before November . Those breakdowns were the same at this point in the early voting period in 2020.\n\nSome polls have suggested that Black men were gradually leaving the Democratic party to vote for Republicans. In 2020, 12% of Black men voted for former President Donald Trump.\n\nTed Johnson, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice , said some Black men find Republicans more attractive because they promote individualism and the idea that hard work, not government dependence, leads to financial success. In 2016, Johnson wrote in the Atlantic that a Black person who supported Trump was likely a \"working-class or lower-middle-class Black man, over the age of 35, and interested in alternative approaches to addressing what ails Black America.\"\n\nStill, Johnson said Black men are not naive and will vote against a Republican candidate who they feel is unfit. And for some Black men, that is the case with Walker who is running against incumbent US Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nThe match-up between Walker and Warnock is one of the closest and most critical Senate races in the country, as Republicans seek to win back control of the body, which is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote.\n\nWalker has been criticized by his opponents for being violent toward his ex-wife and the claim that he paid for the mother of one of his children to get an abortion. Walker told Axios last year that he was \"accountable\" for his past violent behavior, and that people shouldn't be \"ashamed\" for confronting mental health issues.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Walker acknowledged that he sent a $700 check to a woman who alleges the money was provided to reimburse her for an abortion, but denied the check was for that purpose. Walker has been vocal about his anti-abortion views but has gone back and forth about whether he supports exceptions.\n\nWalker is currently polling at 11% with Black men compared to 74% for Warnock.\n\n\"(Walker) is just not an attractive, viable candidate for most Black folks,\" Johnson said. \"I think there are Black men who won't vote for Stacey Abrams but will vote for Raphael Warnock.\"\n\nRecent polls show Republican Gov. Brian Kemp with support from 16% of Black men compared to 77% for Abrams. Johnson said he believes Kemp has more support from Black men because some men still refuse to vote a woman into office.\n\n\"There is a strain of conservatism in Black men that comes with a strain of sexism,\" Johnson said, noting that in 2016 some Black men sat home because they didn't like Trump but also didn't want to see Hillary Clinton as the first female president.\n\nIn recent years, Republicans have faced criticism for being sexist, misogynistic and rejecting women's rights.\n\nWalker's candidacy was the topic of discussion for several Black men who gathered at Anytime Cutz barbershop in Atlanta on a recent Monday afternoon. The chat was part of a series hosted by the Urban League of Greater Atlanta's Black Male Voter Project and Black Men Decide offering Black men a chance to discuss voting and the issues that matter to them.\n\nSome of the Black men present said they found it offensive that the GOP would pit Walker - a former NFL running back with no political experience and a troubled past - against Warnock, a beloved figure in Atlanta's Black community who pastored the church once led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"The guy is looking like a fool,\" said Antwaun Hawkins, a 46-year-old barber. \"That's who we want to put in place to speak for us? Because he's a Black man? No. To me, he looks like an idiot.\"\n\nBethea said after the barbershop event that Walker's candidacy feels like a \"sick joke.\"\n\n\"I think he's embarrassing himself,\" Bethea said. \"I don't play the field in a position that I don't know how to play. Someone talked him out of staying in his lane.\"\n\nBethea said he plans to vote for Warnock because he's a more qualified candidate and pillar in the community.\n\nMoyo Akinade, a 29-year-old soccer coach from Atlanta, said he too will vote for Warnock because he's a positive role model. Walker, meanwhile, perpetuates negative stereotypes about Black men , Akinade said.\n\nThose stereotypes are \"that we are aggressive, we aren't intelligent and we are abusive,\" Akinade said. \"It portrays Black men as being violent. And that's still inaccurate.\"\n\nBut one barber said he doesn't think voters should judge Walker by his past.\n\n\"Everybody has a past, everybody has done something wrong, everybody has lied before, everybody has done something that they shouldn't have done,\" said Charles Scott who manages Anytime Cutz. \"But at one point, people can change. Just like they are bashing Herschel Walker. How do you know he's not a changed man?\"\n\nBlack men interviewed by CNN said they look for more than just character and experience in politicians, but also the issues they address.\n\nA report released by the NAACP in September found that Black men believed racism/discrimination, inflation/cost of living and criminal justice reform/police brutality were the most important issues facing the Black community. The survey also concluded that 41% of Black men disapproved of the job President Joe Biden is doing to address the needs of the Black community.\n\nThe group at Anytime Cutz named financial security, student loan forgiveness, police reform, health care reform and improving jail conditions as their top concerns.\n\nMost said they vote in elections but rarely see lawmakers making decisions that help them personally or their communities.\n\n\"Do something about policing,\" Hawkins said. \"Do something for the people that can't really help themselves. I don't think people choose to be homeless and hungry.\"\n\nHawkins and Bethea said they have given up waiting for policies that will close the wealth gap and give Black Americans a fair shot at success. They are focused on providing for their families.\n\n\"We can't sit around and wait for legislation to change because the kids are at home hungry,\" Hawkins said.\n\nSome of those same sentiments are felt by Black men nearly 900 miles away in New York.\n\nMysonne Linen, a popular activist and rapper from the Bronx, said he can't remember the last time a political candidate spoke directly to Black men during their campaign and delivered on those promises after winning. Linen said Black men are tired of \"pandering.\" Linen wants politicians who genuinely care about Black men living in marginalized communities and will follow through on addressing police reform, livable wage jobs and investment in mental health resources.\n\n\"They have to do a better job with having tangible results,\" Linen said. \"Tell us how you to plan to invest in the communities to change those realities. Get into office and actually fight to do those things.\"\n\nIn the past few months, Abrams has hosted a series of events that targeted Black men in Georgia and released a \"Black Men's Agenda\" that details her plans to invest in Black-owned small businesses, expand Medicaid, increase funding to schools and opportunities for job training and hold police accountable.\n\nBut Linen and Nichols agreed that Abrams' efforts may have come too late. Nichols said he fears that some Black men are already planning to sit home on Election Day or vote for Kemp.\n\n\"I think she didn't necessarily get the right advice at the right time and now it feels like she's pandering,\" Nichols said. \"I think she really is concerned but I think it comes across to some like 'we've been ignored all this time.'\"\n\nNichols said he urges 2024 election candidates to do more outreach to Black men and Black families. The organization Black Men Vote has already launched a national campaign to register one million Black male voters by November 2024.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson said those seeking public office must prioritize the needs of Black men if they want to win.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon both political parties and all candidates to understand that the votes of African American men are not guaranteed,\" Johnson said. \"It's an important voting bloc and candidates must speak to them so they can see how their vote really can support democracy and their quality of life.\"\n\nCNN's Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "More Black men are needed in the classroom, diversity advocates say\n\nJamaal Grant was studying biology at Colby College in Maine when a friend asked if he'd be interested in teaching after graduation.\n\nGrant had planned to go to graduate school and build a career in science, but in need of a job, decided to teach science at a charter school in Boston.\n\nWithin two years of teaching, he realized he had met his calling. His students, most of them Black and some lacking a father figure at home, were routinely coming to him for advice on family challenges, career and life choices, and even sports talk. They confided in him.\n\n\"I felt like I was needed in that space,\" says Grant, now an 8th-grade science teacher in Boston Public Schools. \"I was in there and I was like 'these kids need me.' I felt that every day was worthwhile.\"\n\nData shows that Black male teachers like Grant are underrepresented in schools across the country.\n\nJust 1.3% of public school teachers were Black men in the 2020-21 school year, according to the National Teacher and Principal Survey . That school year, White women made up 61% of public school teachers. Black children, meanwhile, accounted for 15% of public school students in the fall of 2020.\n\nBlack men are sorely needed in the teaching field, advocates say, as the nation's school systems struggle with unfair disciplinary practices , achievement gaps , and political battles over Black history curriculum . Experts say Black male teachers help improve academic outcomes, including graduation rates of Black students.\n\nA new national study published in the peer-reviewed journal Early Education and Development found that children taught by teachers of the same race develop better learning and problem-solving skills by the time they turn seven years old. The impact was felt most in Black and Latino children, the study found.\n\nBlack male teachers are role models to young Black students, advocates say.\n\nAnd a role model is what Johnathan Hines is to his pre-K students at Barack Obama Elementary Magnet School of Technology in Atlanta.\n\nHines, who previously played professional basketball overseas, has taught pre-K for nine years. He said that many of his students who go on to middle and high school often come back to tell him what a difference he has made in their lives.\n\nFor some, he's been a father figure. Hines says that one of his former students even recalls that he once helped them when they lost their first tooth.\n\nIn 2019, Hines became the first Black man to be named Georgia's Pre-K Teacher of the Year .\n\nHe currently serves as an ambassador for the Literacy Lab's Leading Men Fellowship where he helps the group recruit Black male teachers.\n\n\"I want to show other males that it's possible and that you are needed in this space,\" Hines says. \"I see every day the impact that I'm making ... just by being there and being present.\"\n\nSome Black male teachers say their presence in the classroom helps overcome stereotypes children - Black or White -  may have of Black men. Some studies have found that Black male teachers are viewed as disciplinarians and are often the ones called on to punish students.\n\nGrant says it is vital for schools to have a diverse array of Black men teaching, including those who are boisterous, reserved, heterosexual and gay.\n\n\"Blackness is not a monolith,\" Grant said. \"It's important to have a variety of people in front of kids just because it expands their view.

      "text": "Opinion: Why we should all care about Black men's mental health\n\nFollow:\n\nEditor's Note: Keith Magee is a theologian, political adviser and social justice scholar. He is chair and professor of practice in social justice at Newcastle University (United Kingdom). He is visiting professor in cultural justice at University College London Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, senior fellow within Cultural Engagement, where he leads Black Britain and Beyond , a social platform and think tank, and is also a fellow at its Centre on US Politics . He is the author of \" Prophetic Justice: Essays and Reflections on Race, Religion and Politics .\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nLike many Black men, I grew up with a stern father who saw displays of emotion as a sign of weakness. For a long time after becoming a father myself, if overwhelmed by unhappiness or frustration, I would hide my own tears from my little boy.\n\nEventually, I realized I had to break the cycle of repression. Becoming a parent and thinking through how I was parented led me to handle my emotions differently, so that my son wouldn't feel ashamed to show his.\n\nNow my young son knows that men are allowed to cry and that difficult feelings can be expressed and overcome. I hope this will help protect his mental health when he's older, but as a Black American male, unless things change dramatically, I fear he will encounter a unique set of challenges.\n\nThe theme of this year's World Mental Health Day observed on October 10 is \"Mental health is a universal human right.\" I want myself and my fellow Black American men to claim this right, for the sake of ourselves, our families, our communities and our society.\n\nIn the United States, 1 in 5 adults experience mental health difficulties each year, and 9 out of 10 adults believe our nation is now in the throes of a mental health crisis, according to a survey taken last year. Millions of American men suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek help.\n\nMen are nearly four times as likely as women to die by suicide. White men are the group most likely to take their own lives, but from 2014 to 2019, Black people had the largest percentage increase of any ethnic group in suicide death rates - a rise of 30 % - putting Black males at particular risk given the greater proclivity towards suicide among men.\n\nBlack children between the ages of 5 to 12 are also at higher risk: They are twice as likely to die by suicide as their White peers. And there has been a 60% increase over the past two decades in suicide rates among Black boys between the ages of 10 and 19, which I believe constitutes a national emergency.\n\nOpinion: As a father, I'll be sure my Black daughters get 'The Talk'\n\nAs shocking as all these figures are, I don't need statistics to tell me there's something very worrying going on with Black men and their mental health. I can see it all around, including in myself.\n\nHaving wrestled with depression my whole life, I recently found myself at a new low after experiencing a series of bereavements. Among those departed loved ones are two Black men who tragically took their own lives. By trying to stay strong for others instead of acknowledging my own need to process my grief, I made myself sick. In desperation, I sought - and was eventually able to get - professional support.\n\nI am privileged to know a successful, high-functioning Black man who lives with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), a complex mental health condition. Men like him are often labeled the 'angry Black man' rather than being properly diagnosed and treated.\n\nA mix of negative factors expose Black men to mental health difficulties while making us particularly reluctant to seek treatment when we become unwell. This is compounded by the fact that even when we do accept we need help, we face disproportionate barriers to accessing good quality, appropriate mental health care.\n\nOften our struggles are rooted in racial trauma that can be traced back to both historical experiences, such as slavery and ongoing racial discrimination. My father was not alone in acting tough - hiding his emotions from me and my siblings, removing himself completely whenever he felt angry, sad or upset - as a coping mechanism. Oppression and marginalization leads many Black people to grow an invisible shell in the mistaken belief that if you don't allow yourself to have feelings - or at least don't appear to be vulnerable - daily brushes with the myriad brutalities of individual and systemic racism can't hurt you.\n\nHighly traditional gender roles persist in the Black community, stigmatizing men who express vulnerability as shamefully fragile. And if you're born into a culture that promotes hypermasculinity, you are in danger of developing toxic attitudes and behaviors that can exacerbate issues like depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder and substance abuse, leaving you even more isolated. Our collective coping mechanism, it turns out, is just adding to the harms inflicted on us.\n\nThe quickest way to improve your family's mental health\n\nYet, for many Black men, recognizing that they need mental health support is only the first step on a long journey to wellness. The first hurdle they must overcome is an internal one - a deep-rooted distrust of health services, stemming from historical medical mistreatment and modern-day discrimination in health care.\n\nExternal hurdles also come at Black men hard and fast. And when treatment is provided, it is rarely by practitioners equipped to meet Black men's specific needs. The shortage of Black mental health specialists in the US - only 5% of psychologists are Black - makes it extremely hard for us to access truly culturally competent care.\n\nIn an advanced economy like the US, it is simply unforgivable that racial injustice robs a significant demographic group of their right to good mental health. We must fix this, and we can.\n\nBlack men should work together to increase awareness within our community, taking vital messages about mental health to key spaces where men gather, such as places of worship, sporting events - even at the barber shop. I draw inspiration from the Confess Project of America , a national initiative that fosters emotional wellness in the Black community, and that has trained more than 3,000 Black barbers and beauticians to act as mental health advocates.\n\nGovernment can play a role too. The US needs national public health campaigns targeting Black men, the expansion of Medicaid to reduce disparities in access to care, and more mental health clinicians trained in gender- and race-sensitive treatment, building on the good work of organizations such as the Black Mental Health Alliance.\n\nWe have an ethical obligation to commit to achieving racial equality, but we should also remember the countless practical advantages of doing so. Better mental health for Black men is just one of these, but it is one that will undoubtedly benefit the whole country, for when men's distress is ignored, their ability to contribute fully as citizens is severely curtailed.\n\nIf you're the father of a Black son, don't be afraid to cry in front of him. Let that be our gift to America - empowering a new generation of Black men to have the courage to share their feelings and the strength to ask for help.\n\nAnd if you are struggling or have ever struggled, find another man - Black or White, trans, gay or straight, impoverished or wealthy -  and please tell him about your mental health challenges. Don't put on a brave face. Be really honest. Then ask him how he's doing and -  whatever his reply - give him a hug.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website .\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Black men say they feel ignored by politicians. A historic Senate face-off between two Black men isn't helping\n\nAaron Bethea says he has voted election after election for US presidents, governors and senators - and yet those lawmakers have done little to nothing to improve life for him, his family or his community.\n\nBethea said he believes the issues he cares about, financial freedom and equal investment in predominately Black schools, have largely been ignored.\n\n\"Where we are from, nobody really cares about what Black men think,\" said Bethea, an Atlanta father of six who owns a wholesale company that sells televisions. \"They don't do anything for us.\"\n\nBethea, 40, said he still plans to vote Democratic in Georgia's hotly contested gubernatorial and US Senate races. But he's not voting with enthusiasm. He said he is hoping that one day someone will prioritize the needs of Black men.\n\nBethea is not alone. Political analysts, researchers and Black male leaders say politicians are failing to reach some Black men with messaging that resonates with them and visibility in their communities. Those shortcomings could particularly hurt Democrats in the upcoming midterms given Black men are the second most loyal voting bloc for the party next to Black women, experts say.\n\nAnd while Black men have increasingly supported Republicans in recent years, some say the GOP is still missing the mark. Many Black men say they are concerned that Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker does not represent them in a positive light given his many public gaffes , history of domestic violence and being an absentee father .\n\nPolitical analysts worry that the lack of effective messaging could result in Black men sitting home on Nov. 8 and Democrats like Stacey Abrams - who has made a late attempt to reach Black men with a series of events -  losing their races.\n\n\"If some of them feel unmotivated because they don't feel spoken to then you've really got a problem,\" said Jason Nichols, a professor of African American studies at the University of Maryland College Park. \"A lot of these campaigns don't hire Black male advisers. They don't hire Black men to actually tell them how to reach Black men.\"\n\nSo far, 39% of Black voters have been men, and 61% have been women, according to Catalist, a company that provides data and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and gives insights into who is voting before November . Those breakdowns were the same at this point in the early voting period in 2020.\n\nSome polls have suggested that Black men were gradually leaving the Democratic party to vote for Republicans. In 2020, 12% of Black men voted for former President Donald Trump.\n\nTed Johnson, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice , said some Black men find Republicans more attractive because they promote individualism and the idea that hard work, not government dependence, leads to financial success. In 2016, Johnson wrote in the Atlantic that a Black person who supported Trump was likely a \"working-class or lower-middle-class Black man, over the age of 35, and interested in alternative approaches to addressing what ails Black America.\"\n\nStill, Johnson said Black men are not naive and will vote against a Republican candidate who they feel is unfit. And for some Black men, that is the case with Walker who is running against incumbent US Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nThe match-up between Walker and Warnock is one of the closest and most critical Senate races in the country, as Republicans seek to win back control of the body, which is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote.\n\nWalker has been criticized by his opponents for being violent toward his ex-wife and the claim that he paid for the mother of one of his children to get an abortion. Walker told Axios last year that he was \"accountable\" for his past violent behavior, and that people shouldn't be \"ashamed\" for confronting mental health issues.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Walker acknowledged that he sent a $700 check to a woman who alleges the money was provided to reimburse her for an abortion, but denied the check was for that purpose. Walker has been vocal about his anti-abortion views but has gone back and forth about whether he supports exceptions.\n\nWalker is currently polling at 11% with Black men compared to 74% for Warnock.\n\n\"(Walker) is just not an attractive, viable candidate for most Black folks,\" Johnson said. \"I think there are Black men who won't vote for Stacey Abrams but will vote for Raphael Warnock.\"\n\nRecent polls show Republican Gov. Brian Kemp with support from 16% of Black men compared to 77% for Abrams. Johnson said he believes Kemp has more support from Black men because some men still refuse to vote a woman into office.\n\n\"There is a strain of conservatism in Black men that comes with a strain of sexism,\" Johnson said, noting that in 2016 some Black men sat home because they didn't like Trump but also didn't want to see Hillary Clinton as the first female president.\n\nIn recent years, Republicans have faced criticism for being sexist, misogynistic and rejecting women's rights.\n\nWalker's candidacy was the topic of discussion for several Black men who gathered at Anytime Cutz barbershop in Atlanta on a recent Monday afternoon. The chat was part of a series hosted by the Urban League of Greater Atlanta's Black Male Voter Project and Black Men Decide offering Black men a chance to discuss voting and the issues that matter to them.\n\nSome of the Black men present said they found it offensive that the GOP would pit Walker - a former NFL running back with no political experience and a troubled past - against Warnock, a beloved figure in Atlanta's Black community who pastored the church once led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"The guy is looking like a fool,\" said Antwaun Hawkins, a 46-year-old barber. \"That's who we want to put in place to speak for us? Because he's a Black man? No. To me, he looks like an idiot.\"\n\nBethea said after the barbershop event that Walker's candidacy feels like a \"sick joke.\"\n\n\"I think he's embarrassing himself,\" Bethea said. \"I don't play the field in a position that I don't know how to play. Someone talked him out of staying in his lane.\"\n\nBethea said he plans to vote for Warnock because he's a more qualified candidate and pillar in the community.\n\nMoyo Akinade, a 29-year-old soccer coach from Atlanta, said he too will vote for Warnock because he's a positive role model. Walker, meanwhile, perpetuates negative stereotypes about Black men , Akinade said.\n\nThose stereotypes are \"that we are aggressive, we aren't intelligent and we are abusive,\" Akinade said. \"It portrays Black men as being violent. And that's still inaccurate.\"\n\nBut one barber said he doesn't think voters should judge Walker by his past.\n\n\"Everybody has a past, everybody has done something wrong, everybody has lied before, everybody has done something that they shouldn't have done,\" said Charles Scott who manages Anytime Cutz. \"But at one point, people can change. Just like they are bashing Herschel Walker. How do you know he's not a changed man?\"\n\nBlack men interviewed by CNN said they look for more than just character and experience in politicians, but also the issues they address.\n\nA report released by the NAACP in September found that Black men believed racism/discrimination, inflation/cost of living and criminal justice reform/police brutality were the most important issues facing the Black community. The survey also concluded that 41% of Black men disapproved of the job President Joe Biden is doing to address the needs of the Black community.\n\nThe group at Anytime Cutz named financial security, student loan forgiveness, police reform, health care reform and improving jail conditions as their top concerns.\n\nMost said they vote in elections but rarely see lawmakers making decisions that help them personally or their communities.\n\n\"Do something about policing,\" Hawkins said. \"Do something for the people that can't really help themselves. I don't think people choose to be homeless and hungry.\"\n\nHawkins and Bethea said they have given up waiting for policies that will close the wealth gap and give Black Americans a fair shot at success. They are focused on providing for their families.\n\n\"We can't sit around and wait for legislation to change because the kids are at home hungry,\" Hawkins said.\n\nSome of those same sentiments are felt by Black men nearly 900 miles away in New York.\n\nMysonne Linen, a popular activist and rapper from the Bronx, said he can't remember the last time a political candidate spoke directly to Black men during their campaign and delivered on those promises after winning. Linen said Black men are tired of \"pandering.\" Linen wants politicians who genuinely care about Black men living in marginalized communities and will follow through on addressing police reform, livable wage jobs and investment in mental health resources.\n\n\"They have to do a better job with having tangible results,\" Linen said. \"Tell us how you to plan to invest in the communities to change those realities. Get into office and actually fight to do those things.\"\n\nIn the past few months, Abrams has hosted a series of events that targeted Black men in Georgia and released a \"Black Men's Agenda\" that details her plans to invest in Black-owned small businesses, expand Medicaid, increase funding to schools and opportunities for job training and hold police accountable.\n\nBut Linen and Nichols agreed that Abrams' efforts may have come too late. Nichols said he fears that some Black men are already planning to sit home on Election Day or vote for Kemp.\n\n\"I think she didn't necessarily get the right advice at the right time and now it feels like she's pandering,\" Nichols said. \"I think she really is concerned but I think it comes across to some like 'we've been ignored all this time.'\"\n\nNichols said he urges 2024 election candidates to do more outreach to Black men and Black families. The organization Black Men Vote has already launched a national campaign to register one million Black male voters by November 2024.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson said those seeking public office must prioritize the needs of Black men if they want to win.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon both political parties and all candidates to understand that the votes of African American men are not guaranteed,\" Johnson said. \"It's an important voting bloc and candidates must speak to them so they can see how their vote really can support democracy and their quality of life.\"\n\nCNN's Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "More Black men are needed in the classroom, diversity advocates say\n\nJamaal Grant was studying biology at Colby College in Maine when a friend asked if he'd be interested in teaching after graduation.\n\nGrant had planned to go to graduate school and build a career in science, but in need of a job, decided to teach science at a charter school in Boston.\n\nWithin two years of teaching, he realized he had met his calling. His students, most of them Black and some lacking a father figure at home, were routinely coming to him for advice on family challenges, career and life choices, and even sports talk. They confided in him.\n\n\"I felt like I was needed in that space,\" says Grant, now an 8th-grade science teacher in Boston Public Schools. \"I was in there and I was like 'these kids need me.' I felt that every day was worthwhile.\"\n\nData shows that Black male teachers like Grant are underrepresented in schools across the country.\n\nJust 1.3% of public school teachers were Black men in the 2020-21 school year, according to the National Teacher and Principal Survey . That school year, White women made up 61% of public school teachers. Black children, meanwhile, accounted for 15% of public school students in the fall of 2020.\n\nBlack men are sorely needed in the teaching field, advocates say, as the nation's school systems struggle with unfair disciplinary practices , achievement gaps , and political battles over Black history curriculum . Experts say Black male teachers help improve academic outcomes, including graduation rates of Black students.\n\nA new national study published in the peer-reviewed journal Early Education and Development found that children taught by teachers of the same race develop better learning and problem-solving skills by the time they turn seven years old. The impact was felt most in Black and Latino children, the study found.\n\nBlack male teachers are role models to young Black students, advocates say.\n\nAnd a role model is what Johnathan Hines is to his pre-K students at Barack Obama Elementary Magnet School of Technology in Atlanta.\n\nHines, who previously played professional basketball overseas, has taught pre-K for nine years. He said that many of his students who go on to middle and high school often come back to tell him what a difference he has made in their lives.\n\nFor some, he's been a father figure. Hines says that one of his former students even recalls that he once helped them when they lost their first tooth.\n\nIn 2019, Hines became the first Black man to be named Georgia's Pre-K Teacher of the Year .\n\nHe currently serves as an ambassador for the Literacy Lab's Leading Men Fellowship where he helps the group recruit Black male teachers.\n\n\"I want to show other males that it's possible and that you are needed in this space,\" Hines says. \"I see every day the impact that I'm making ... just by being there and being present.\"\n\nSome Black male teachers say their presence in the classroom helps overcome stereotypes children - Black or White -  may have of Black men. Some studies have found that Black male teachers are viewed as disciplinarians and are often the ones called on to punish students.\n\nGrant says it is vital for schools to have a diverse array of Black men teaching, including those who are boisterous, reserved, heterosexual and gay.\n\n\"Blackness is not a monolith,\" Grant said. \"It's important to have a variety of people in front of kids just because it expands their view. A lot of times in inner cities, it's easy for their world to become small.\"\n\nSome non-profit groups say that the biggest challenges to recruiting more Black men to teach are low pay, racial bias in school systems and retention.\n\nRobert Hendricks III, founder of the He Is Me Institute - a Boston-based group that recruits and trains Black men to become teachers - says that in many cases, school systems have not been welcoming to Black men as students or teachers.

      "text": "For Black runners, every stride comes with a fear they can't outrun\n\nEvery time Roy Oduor laces up his bright red sneakers for a run in his Kansas neighborhood, he goes through a checklist of precautions.\n\nHe wears a brightly colored wool hat in the winter, fearing a dark one could get him mistaken for a ski mask-donning attacker. He throws on a reflective vest to make it clear he's a runner and not a loiterer. When he sees police officers, he waves emphatically so they can remember him as a nonthreatening jogger if he's ever wrongfully accused of anything.\n\nFor Black runners like Oduor, every stride comes with a fear that can't be outrun. After Ahmaud Arbery's shooting death a year ago as two White men pursued him while he was jogging, Black runners told CNN they've become even more vigilant.\n\n\"I take extra measures to make myself look like a runner and make sure nothing arouses any suspicion,\" said Oduor, 42, who lives in the majority-White city of Lenexa and started running six years ago after he was diagnosed with prediabetes.\n\n\"I avoid residential areas and use main roads. I panic if a car is following too closely during my runs. I make sure my phone is fully charged and I can hit record anytime.\"\n\nArbery, 25, was jogging near his neighborhood in coastal Georgia when he was shot by a father and son duo who now face murder and other charges, prosecutors have said. They have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn a separate incident, a woman in New York City was charged with attempted assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment after she was captured on video in August hurling a racial slur at a Black runner. She pleaded not guilty and is next due in court in March, her attorney told CNN.\n\nThe cases have become yet more examples of the many perils Black people face while engaged in ordinary activities .\n\nRelated article Runners around the world dedicated 2.23 miles to shooting victim Ahmaud Arbery\n\nIt's unclear what percentage of runners nationwide identify as minorities, but their numbers have grown rapidly in recent years, said Tony Reed, cofounder of the National Black Marathoners Association. Most running events in the United States collect data on runners' gender and age - but not ethnicity - making it difficult to get credible stats, he added.\n\nReed, 65, describes himself as a \"semi-retired\" runner who logs a few miles a day in his Dallas neighborhood. The phenomenon dubbed \"running while Black\" is nothing new, he said. Arbery's death just made people pay more attention.\n\n\"People have spit on me while I'm running, called me the N-word, milk cartons have been thrown at me,\" he said. \"Some people have stopped or asked if I'm lost when I'm running in White neighborhoods. One thing I did was study judo and karate simply because I cannot carry a gun while I'm running. I needed to protect myself.\"\n\nWhen he worked as a running coach, Reed encouraged his students to take self-defense classes, he said.\n\nBlack runners are constantly aware that doing something they love comes with inherent risks, said Alison Désir, cochair of the Running Industry Diversity Coalition .\n\n\"For Black and brown runners, many of us have always known that you're subject to potential violence. This is not new to us,\" she said. \"What's new is that finally some White people have witnessed an awakening, a tipping point.\"\n\nAn avid runner, Désir never runs in the dark and makes sure her hands are not in her pockets when she runs past police officers, she said. She avoids running in only shorts and a sports bra - an added burden for female runners fearful of attacks for dressing in a way some may consider provocative.\n\n\"As a Black woman, I cannot divorce the two - which I experience for being Black or which I experience for being a woman. My experience is intersectional as someone with both identities,\" she said.\n\nWomen's Running magazine named Désir one of its 25 people reshaping the running industry for the better. After Arbery's killing, the mental health advocate and founder of several running organizations spearheaded broader conversations on racism in the running world.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Running Industry Diversity Coalition, companies and running organizations have teamed up to increase diversity and ensure Black, indigenous and people of color are represented in the sport, she said.\n\nRelated video 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery fatally shot while running\n\nThe coalition's fight for equality goes beyond racial discrimination to include religion, gender identity, sexuality and immigration status. Part of its effort includes hosting educational sessions for those in the running industry on decision-making, authentic marketing and hiring practices.\n\n\"The idea that you can go outside to do something that you enjoy and love, and get gunned down ... is really devastating,\" she said. \"But I'm really hopeful. I hope that running truly can become an activity that anyone can ultimately  participate in, that a lot of people are able to run without fear.\"\n\nOther organizations aim to create more awareness and advocate for changes to keep Black runners safe.\n\nEdward Walton cofounded Black Men Run in Atlanta eight years ago to encourage African Americans to stay healthy. It has since grown into a national organization with tens of thousands of members and chapters in 32 states.\n\nRelated article These are the ordinary things they were doing when they were killed by police\n\nIt also has morphed into a brotherhood of men running together to ensure safety in numbers. After Arbery's death, members of the group started taking more safety measures, Walton said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's like doing a math test or a calculus test where you have to factor in so many things,\" Walton said. \"Like the time of day. Where am I running? What clothes am I running in? Something as mundane as how fast I'm I running? Does it look like I'm running away from something?\"\n\nStill, the issue of running while Black goes beyond surface factors and is rooted in systemic racism, Walton said. \"If you can cure that, you can cure the majority of things that are ailing this country,\" he said.\n\nRunning has not always appealed to young Black men because, unlike other sports such as basketball and football, there's no money in it except for elite athletes, Walton said. Some Black people also have shunned running because they falsely believe it causes knee damage, Reed said.\n\nBut perceptions are changing as more minority runners hit the pavement, reap physical benefits and win notable races, they said.\n\nThe shifting culture also mirrors the time when tennis and golf were considered \"White sports,\" Walton said. When Serena and Venus Williams and Tiger Woods started playing, they helped draw more diverse fans and players, and he said he expects the same will happen with running.\n\nRelated article Plus-size runner leads the way for overweight athletes\n\nAs groups like Black Men Run and the National Black Marathoners Association work to encourage minorities to run regardless of their level of athleticism, they and organizations including the Running Industry Diversity Coalition and the Atlanta Track Club are combating racism in the running community.\n\nThe Atlanta club, perhaps the largest such organization near where Arbery was killed, recently expanded its diversity committee and launched conversations about the problem, a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The goal is to understand each other's perspectives and also share those perspectives with our broader community,\" Jay Holder said. \"We believe that running and walking should be universally accessible and personal safety due to the color of someone's skin should not be a barrier.\"\n\nDespite the fear and exhausting precautions, Oduor said he'll take his chances with running.\n\nHis doctor gave him two options: run or lose a limb to diabetes.\n\nCNN's Alec Snyder contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What black men of Dallas need you to know\n\nWatch \"Black, White and Blue: America 2016,\" a two-hour Town Hall moderated by CNN's Don Lemon, tonight at 10 ET\n\nIt has to change.\n\nSurely this is either rock bottom or a tipping point, they say.\n\nIt shouldn't have taken the deaths of two black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, or the countless ones before that, they say. And it shouldn't have taken the gunning down of five white police officers to get the nation here either.\n\nFor a group of black men who've gathered in a living room outside of Dallas, it's not about poetic ideas. This is their reality. And they can't take it anymore.\n\n\"Scared of being killed by a cop. Scared for my children. Scared to fail because of the color of my skin.\"\n\n\"I have two sons, one is 20 years old, one is 17, and I'm afraid for their lives,\" Texas pastor Charles Colbert says. \"How they are going to be perceived, [and] if they are going to live past 25 years old.\"\n\nRelated video President Obama's Dallas police memorial speech\n\nDerek, a community organizer who asked to be identified only by first name because of his job, brought together these men, whose ages range from 17 to 59. They're here, at CNN's request, to listen to the president as he stands at a podium in Dallas, once again a mourner-in-chief .\n\nPresident Obama's voice quivers as he implores all sides to drop their biases: for police to picture those they pull over as their sons, for those who encounter police to imagine them as their father.\n\nIt's a scab that's been ripped open again and again for these black men. The president's prose on Tuesday is a painful reminder of how they live every day, how they are perceived and how they must act in order to survive.\n\nEvery time 18-year-old Kenyatta Sewell Jr. leaves his friends, they part with a specific goodbye: \"Stay safe out there.\"\n\n\"Because we never know ... it may be the last time you say goodbye to one of your closest friends,\" he says in a matter-of-fact tone. His voice doesn't break, nor does it grow louder.\n\nSewell says he and his friends don't talk about police shootings or racial tensions all of the time, but those thoughts are always there. He worries about being victimized for something he's not involved in. He worries what it would do to his family if something did happen.\n\n\"Especially as a black male, and a lot of us being the only children, we have single mothers,\" he says. \"We know how important we are to each other in the lives of our parents and friends.\"\n\nMarco Smith, 38, works overnight hours as an engineer. The server room has to be kept on lower temperatures, so he often puts on a hoodie. But this is a decision he has to think about on a regular basis.\n\n\"I go to get something to eat at three in the morning, and somebody's in the elevator ... I scared them because I got the hoodie on. I can see it,\" he says.\n\nAs they watch Obama on their television screens, these men are revealing their vulnerabilities: \"Scared of being killed by a cop,\" \"scared for my children,\" \"scared to fail because of the color of my skin.\"\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for the older men in this room is whether or not the world can change fast enough.\n\n\"What scares me the most is my child growing up in a world that really doesn't value her for who she is,\" says Gerry Brown, 37. \"Or doesn't see the value that she brings to society and treats her differently because of it.\"\n\nThat's a feeling 18-year-old Antowon Shade knows all too well.\n\n\"Nothing is easy for me,\" he says.\n\nBut he believes the world can change - his mentors in this room have taught him that he can be part of the solution.\n\nThis group isn't just mourning the black men who have been killed; they too are grieving for the fallen Dallas officers. There doesn't need to be a line in the sand, they all say. Both sides just need to hear each other.\n\n\"We've adopted this either-or mentality,\" Smith says. \"Just because [I] want to acknowledge that there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, doesn't mean that it makes me anti-police. Or because I support the police that doesn't mean I'm anti-black or anti-black matters.\"\n\nPastor Darrell Porter, stands on one side of the room, his hands in his pockets, as he listens to the young men talk about what it's like being black at school or at work.\n\nPorter, 59, lived in Memphis during the civil rights era. He remembers tanks on the street, the dusk-til-dawn curfew.\n\n\"If you came off your porch, you had a white officer or white national guardsman that would do some things to you even if you were a child,\" he recalls. \"I lived that. This isn't new. So the question is how do we change the dynamic? How do we change the conversation?\"\n\nPorter tells the younger men here that it's time to move past basic rhetoric. For example, he encourages one of the teens, who is about to leave for college, to become active in a group where he can share his perspective.\n\n\"If you want to change the system, you have to be part of the system,\" Porter says. \"And the way to have your voice heard - you vote. You stand up and speak.\"\n\n\"I realize I can be killed tomorrow.\"\n\nBut outside this emotionally charged room, beyond this day where all eyes are on these issues, after the television cameras turn away... Where will change come from?\n\nIt's about more than race and the police. It's about economic disparity, reducing dropout rates in school, sending more black men to college and turning them into more productive fathers when the time comes.\n\nRelated video Talking to kids about policing and race\n\nPastor Colbert says Obama's acknowledgment of some of those very issues is a good start, but the rest of the country has to come together and find those solutions.\n\n\"He put it out there,\" Colbert says. \"Now we have to go fix it.\"\n\n\"The thing America has to know: If it doesn't get better it gets worse,\" says Derek, the man who brought this group together. For him, the stakes are even higher: He has two teenage sons.\n\n\"I realize I can be killed tomorrow,\" he says, his voice breaking at the thought. \"And they've got to carry the torch on for me if it happens.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Opinion: Why we should all care about Black men's mental health\n\nFollow:\n\nEditor's Note: Keith Magee is a theologian, political adviser and social justice scholar. He is chair and professor of practice in social justice at Newcastle University (United Kingdom). He is visiting professor in cultural justice at University College London Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, senior fellow within Cultural Engagement, where he leads Black Britain and Beyond , a social platform and think tank, and is also a fellow at its Centre on US Politics . He is the author of \" Prophetic Justice: Essays and Reflections on Race, Religion and Politics .\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nLike many Black men, I grew up with a stern father who saw displays of emotion as a sign of weakness. For a long time after becoming a father myself, if overwhelmed by unhappiness or frustration, I would hide my own tears from my little boy.\n\nEventually, I realized I had to break the cycle of repression. Becoming a parent and thinking through how I was parented led me to handle my emotions differently, so that my son wouldn't feel ashamed to show his.\n\nNow my young son knows that men are allowed to cry and that difficult feelings can be expressed and overcome. I hope this will help protect his mental health when he's older, but as a Black American male, unless things change dramatically, I fear he will encounter a unique set of challenges.\n\nThe theme of this year's World Mental Health Day observed on October 10 is \"Mental health is a universal human right.\" I want myself and my fellow Black American men to claim this right, for the sake of ourselves, our families, our communities and our society.\n\nIn the United States, 1 in 5 adults experience mental health difficulties each year, and 9 out of 10 adults believe our nation is now in the throes of a mental health crisis, according to a survey taken last year. Millions of American men suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, and are far less likely than women to seek help.\n\nMen are nearly four times as likely as women to die by suicide. White men are the group most likely to take their own lives, but from 2014 to 2019, Black people had the largest percentage increase of any ethnic group in suicide death rates - a rise of 30 % - putting Black males at particular risk given the greater proclivity towards suicide among men.\n\nBlack children between the ages of 5 to 12 are also at higher risk: They are twice as likely to die by suicide as their White peers. And there has been a 60% increase over the past two decades in suicide rates among Black boys between the ages of 10 and 19, which I believe constitutes a national emergency.\n\nOpinion: As a father, I'll be sure my Black daughters get 'The Talk'\n\nAs shocking as all these figures are, I don't need statistics to tell me there's something very worrying going on with Black men and their mental health. I can see it all around, including in myself.\n\nHaving wrestled with depression my whole life, I recently found myself at a new low after experiencing a series of bereavements. Among those departed loved ones are two Black men who tragically took their own lives. By trying to stay strong for others instead of acknowledging my own need to process my grief, I made myself sick. In desperation, I sought - and was eventually able to get - professional support.\n\nI am privileged to know a successful, high-functioning Black man who lives with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), a complex mental health condition. Men like him are often labeled the 'angry Black man' rather than being properly diagnosed and treated.\n\nA mix of negative factors expose Black men to mental health difficulties while making us particularly reluctant to seek treatment when we become unwell. This is compounded by the fact that even when we do accept we need help, we face disproportionate barriers to accessing good quality, appropriate mental health care.\n\nOften our struggles are rooted in racial trauma that can be traced back to both historical experiences, such as slavery and ongoing racial discrimination. My father was not alone in acting tough - hiding his emotions from me and my siblings, removing himself completely whenever he felt angry, sad or upset - as a coping mechanism. Oppression and marginalization leads many Black people to grow an invisible shell in the mistaken belief that if you don't allow yourself to have feelings - or at least don't appear to be vulnerable - daily brushes with the myriad brutalities of individual and systemic racism can't hurt you.\n\nHighly traditional gender roles persist in the Black community, stigmatizing men who express vulnerability as shamefully fragile. And if you're born into a culture that promotes hypermasculinity, you are in danger of developing toxic attitudes and behaviors that can exacerbate issues like depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder and substance abuse, leaving you even more isolated. Our collective coping mechanism, it turns out, is just adding to the harms inflicted on us.\n\nThe quickest way to improve your family's mental health\n\nYet, for many Black men, recognizing that they need mental health support is only the first step on a long journey to wellness. The first hurdle they must overcome is an internal one - a deep-rooted distrust of health services, stemming from historical medical mistreatment and modern-day discrimination in health care.\n\nExternal hurdles also come at Black men hard and fast. And when treatment is provided, it is rarely by practitioners equipped to meet Black men's specific needs. The shortage of Black mental health specialists in the US - only 5% of psychologists are Black - makes it extremely hard for us to access truly culturally competent care.\n\nIn an advanced economy like the US, it is simply unforgivable that racial injustice robs a significant demographic group of their right to good mental health. We must fix this, and we can.\n\nBlack men should work together to increase awareness within our community, taking vital messages about mental health to key spaces where men gather, such as places of worship, sporting events - even at the barber shop. I draw inspiration from the Confess Project of America , a national initiative that fosters emotional wellness in the Black community, and that has trained more than 3,000 Black barbers and beauticians to act as mental health advocates.\n\nGovernment can play a role too. The US needs national public health campaigns targeting Black men, the expansion of Medicaid to reduce disparities in access to care, and more mental health clinicians trained in gender- and race-sensitive treatment, building on the good work of organizations such as the Black Mental Health Alliance.\n\nWe have an ethical obligation to commit to achieving racial equality, but we should also remember the countless practical advantages of doing so. Better mental health for Black men is just one of these, but it is one that will undoubtedly benefit the whole country, for when men's distress is ignored, their ability to contribute fully as citizens is severely curtailed.\n\nIf you're the father of a Black son, don't be afraid to cry in front of him. Let that be our gift to America - empowering a new generation of Black men to have the courage to share their feelings and the strength to ask for help.\n\nAnd if you are struggling or have ever struggled, find another man - Black or White, trans, gay or straight, impoverished or wealthy -  and please tell him about your mental health challenges. Don't put on a brave face. Be really honest. Then ask him how he's doing and -  whatever his reply - give him a hug.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website .\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Black men are more likely to die from skin cancer because they're getting diagnosed later. Here are 3 early signs to watch out for.\n\nA new study from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology has found some alarming statistics in how skin cancer is diagnosed in men across different racial groups.\n\nIn the study, published on Tuesday, nearly half of Black men were diagnosed when the disease was already in an advanced stage, compared to about one-in-five white men.\n\nWhen caught early - in stage I or II - a melanoma lesion can be surgically removed because the cancer hasn't yet spread to a person's lymph nodes or distant organs. But later diagnosis involves more invasive treatments like immunotherapy or chemo, and it also cuts the chances of survival.\n\nIn the study, white men had the highest five-year survival rates (75.1%), compared to only about half of Black men (51.7%) who survived for five years after diagnoses.\n\nOne possible theory as to why they were diagnosed so late is the difference in how melanoma presents in Black men. While every other group in the study was more likely to have superficial spreading melanoma - the most common type of melanoma characterized by abnormal skin lesions - Black men were more likely to have acral melanoma , or melanoma on their hands or feet.\n\nBelow are three places that Black men should check for melanoma.\n\nMelanated skin can filter up to twice as much UV light as lighter skin, which is why skin cancer is less common in people with darker skin tones.\n\nHowever, the bottoms of your feet can be an unexpected place for melanoma to form.\n\nDr. Alexander Witkowski, an assistant professor of dermatology at the OHSU School of Medicine, previously told Insider that everyone \"has the same amount of pigment in these limited areas, so the risk level is pretty much the same\" for Black men as it is for white men.\n\nLike the soles of the feet, palms have less melanin and are more at risk for developing skin cancer lesions.\n\nAdditionally, not all lesions are dark; Dr. Joanna Ludzik, an assistant professor of dermatology at the OHSU School of Medicine, previously said that \"pink melanoma\" can appear as a small pink or white spot. One sign is a spot shining under a light or mirror.\n\nWhile melanoma is usually associated with asymmetrical moles, Witkowski and Ludzik said that it can also present as streaks in fingernails and toenails. For the most effective skin cancer screenings, it's important to remove nail polish before your visit.\n\nNo matter what race you are, melanoma can form anywhere on the body - including inside the mouth or on the eyeballs, according to Witkowski and Ludzik.\n\nIn addition to all the above, it's important to keep an eye on any unusual growths using the ABCDE method , especially if you experience itching or bleeding .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Suicide attempts are rising among young Black men. Experts say they face a 'perfect storm' of hardships.\n\nWhile rates of suicide ideation and anxiety have risen sharply during the pandemic, a new study finds that suicide attempts, particularly among adolescents, have been rising at an alarming rate long before COVID-19.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the journal JAMA, found that teenagers attempting suicide increased 22% over the course of nearly three decades, but the trend varied depending on sex and race.\n\nBlack males had the highest increase in suicide attempts compared to any other race in the group, for example, increasing nearly 80%.\n\nOther females groups had this upward trend, too. More white women attempted suicide from 2009-2019, for example. Suicide ideation has also increased for white, Black, and Hispanic women.\n\nResearchers at Indiana and Purdue University surveyed 183,563 high school students from 1991 to 2019 in the US. The survey was given twice a year and asked three questions about suicide ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts.\n\nThe study authors said young Black men face financial hardship, among other stressors, and may have untreated mental health needs.\n\n\"It's an awful perfect storm of a number of factors,\" Alfiee M. Breland-Noble , Ph.D. and founder of the AAKOMA project , said about the reasons behind the upward trend.\n\nBreland-Noble pointed to the fact that young Black men are discriminated against in school and can often be perceived as older than they are.\n\nThere is also a lack of Black therapists to speak to young Black men about the hardships they face. No matter how well-meaning a non-Black psychologist is, Breland-Noble said, they can't relate to the lived experiences of a young Black man.\n\n\"They don't understand the concepts that your family has to deal with, the day-to-day stressors. They don't understand racial trauma, they don't understand racism-induced stress,\" Breland-Noble said.\n\nBreland-Noble told Insider she has been heartened to see famous men of color, like Wayne Brady and Charlamagne tha God, talking about their mental health problems, inspiring young Black men to open up.\n\n\"They're able to see people who look like them who have said 'Yeah, this is something I struggle with too.' That in a tiny way decreases the stigma in terms of the conversation,\" Breland-Noble said.\n\nBut both Breland-Noble and the authors of the JAMA study said it's not on young Black men, but on the medical community to meet them where they are.\n\n\"For males and Black youths in particular,\" the authors wrote, \"growing risks, such as adverse childhood experiences, systematic racism, discrimination , neighborhood violence, and socioeconomic disparities\" need to be addressed.\n\nBreland-Noble agreed. \"There's some really significant differences in terms of how communities approach mental health, approach suicide, and approach seeking mental health care.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing depression or has had thoughts of harming themself or taking their own life, get help. In the US, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , which provides 24/7, free, confidential support for people in distress, as well as best practices for professionals and resources to aid in prevention and crisis situations. Help is also available through the Crisis Text Line - just text \"HOME\" to 741741. The International Association for Suicide Prevention offers resources for those outside the US.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How the shocking death of Virgil Abloh is sparking important discussions on Black men's health\n\nGroundbreaking designer Virgil Abloh 's legacy is extending far beyond the fashion world, as his recent death is inspiring necessary conversations about Black men's health.\n\nAbloh, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's men's wear and founder of the luxury streetwear fashion label Off-White, died Sunday  of a rare and aggressive cancer called cardiac angiosarcoma, according to a statement posted to his Instagram.\n\n\"He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture,\" the statement read.\n\nThe cancer, which can block blood flow out of the heart, has a low survival rate.\n\n\"Once a cardiac sarcoma has progressed to the point that symptoms begin to occur, it has often metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body, making treatment challenging,\" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine .\n\nAbloh has spotlighted cardiac angiosarcoma, as Google searches for the disease grew tenfold since his death was announced.\n\nDerek Griffith, an oncology professor at Georgetown University said that, on a practical level, Abloh's death could inspire more people to take any changes in health seriously since many people looked up to him and admired the barrier breaking work he did.\n\n\"It's hard to be hopeful that this one incident will get people to wake up, but hopefully for some it will trigger them to stop and look more closely at some of these issues,\" the founding director of the Georgetown Racial Justice Institute said.\n\nBlack men have the lowest life expectancy of any other racial and ethnic group in the US, according to the CDC . Experts attribute this discrepancy to several causes, including racial discrimination, high rates of incarceration, and unaffordable and insufficient health resources targeted to this group.\n\nAaron Perry, the founder of Rebalanced-Life Wellness Association - a health center in Madison that supports Black boys' and men's health - said that he has personally observed more patients who want to prioritize their health after high profile deaths of Black men.\n\n\"After John Singleton died, people started coming in to check their blood pressure,\" Perry told Insider. \"The same thing happened after Chadwick Boseman passed away, where people started asking questions about cancer screenings.\"\n\nAs many took to social media to share tributes to Abloh , the fashion icon's unexpected death has also prompted criticism that society values the legacy and work of people of color more than their health.\n\nSome commentators online took issue with phrasing Abloh's battle with cancer as a silent struggle, asserting that the public is not entitled to information about his diagnosis and speculating that perhaps he decided to keep his illness secret so as not to be penalized by the fashion industry.\n\nAlthough workplace discrimination based on illness or discrimination is illegal, such discrimination can appear in more insidious ways as people with chronic illness or disability face workplaces that were not designed for them.\n\n\"A lot of ppl are hiding illnesses because of ableism in the corporate world,\"a music artist who goes by the name Jordan Occasionally, wrote in a tweet that received more than 29,000 likes as of Tuesday afternoon, read.\n\n\"We can't be shocked when we find out about 'hidden illnesses' when industries like Virgil's and Chadwick's don't celebrate disabled folks.\"\n\nThe death of the leading designer drew comparisons to that of acclaimed actor Chadwick Boseman. Boseman, who is best known for starring in Black Panther and a host of bipics depicting prominent Black figures, died of colon cancer in 2020.\n\nSimilarly to Abloh, Boseman had been battling health issues for years, unbeknownst to most of his fans.\n\nThe public does not know the specifics of Abloh's medical history, the thought processes behind his decision to shield his diagnosis from the public, or whether stepping back from his career would have bolstered his health.\n\nStill experts say that the fact that he was an incredibly accomplished individual invites a dialogue about how successful people of color are sometimes forced to choose between their health and their legacy.\n\nMen in particular are prone to working through health problems, per Griffith. He cited the idea of John Henryism . Coined by the epidemiologist Sherman James, John Henryism describes the phenomenon whereby people who push themselves harder to cope with chronic stresses like racial discrimination experience increased health issues.\n\nBlack people have significantly higher rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and strokes than white people do - conditions that some medical experts connect with dealing with structural racism.\n\n\"Working up until the end of an illness is not necessarily unique, but it's really the context of Black men making these choices that we're starting to see more conversation about,\" Griffith said.\n\n\"If he had stopped working a few years ago, there were things he wouldn't have accomplished,\" he added.\n\nGriffith noted that \"as much as we critique people for making choices like this where they prioritize their work over their health,\" society most often \"celebrate[s] people for making choices like this.\"\n\n\"We don't want to be judgemental about the choice he made [to continue working], he said. \"But these illnesses, particularly at an age of 41, those kind of things happening in the media do tend to get people to stop and think about, 'hey I'm 41, is this something that could happen to me?'\"\n\nPerry added that while the details surrounding Abloh's decision to not go public with his diagnosis before his death are unknown, there's a need to end the stigma of discussing health among Black men.\n\n\"We need to sound the alarm that Black men are experiencing a health crisis,\" Perry said. \"We have to remove the stigma of being sick in our communities.\"\n\nHe added that \"it breaks my heart that I couldn't be there for\" his own close friend whole was ill before he died.\n\n\"There's this feeling that if you're a Black man and you get sick, you're somehow a failure,\" he said. \"So we need to do a better job of reaching out and encouraging conversations and telling people, 'I love you too much to not care about your health.'\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Barack Obama's message to Black male voters angered some Democrats. Why it matters.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama this week hit the campaign trail for Vice President Kamala Harris, part of a concerted effort to rally support around the Democratic presidential nominee with less than a month remaining before the election.\n\nObama has long been known for his soaring oratory, which helped propel him to the White House in 2008. That year, Obama's diverse voting coalition was headlined by overwhelming support from Black and young voters, two groups that Harris needs to win in November.\n\nBut Obama's remarks while in Pittsburgh on Thursday sparked a major debate about Black voters and their loyalty to the Democratic Party and former President Donald Trump's push to make inroads with the key group.\n\n\"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,\" Obama said of Black male voters. \"I've got a problem with that.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nWith Harris working to build her own voting coalition in what's expected to be a tight race, every vote will matter. Here's why Obama's remarks on Harris' presidential candidacy are so significant.\n\nIn virtually every national poll , Harris boasts significant leads with female voters, buoyed by her strength on issues like reproductive rights and healthcare. Harris has recently cut into Trump's long-standing advantage on economic issues, which could be pivotal in battleground states like Arizona and North Carolina .\n\nMeanwhile, Trump continues to poll well with male voters, particularly among white men who didn't attend college.\n\nIn the latest New York Times/Siena College national poll , Harris led Trump 49% to 46% among likely voters. While Harris had a 16-point lead with women, Trump had an 11-point edge with men.\n\nObama's remarks reflected concerns among many Democrats that Black men - particularly young Black men - are gravitating toward Trump and could cost Harris the election.\n\nBut some Democrats have called out the former president for his remarks, arguing that his admonishment of Black men put off by Harris' gender was misplaced.\n\n\"Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled in ways that no other group [is]?\" former Ohio state senator and ex-Democratic congressional candidate Nina Turner told CNN on Thursday.\n\nBlack men and Black women do not vote much differently, it's wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats. It's patronizing and wrong. pic.twitter.com/2OXmq9q1TW\n\n\"Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out Black men is wrong,\" she continued. \"Some of the Black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way, and even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it.\"\n\nTurner and some other Democrats have noted that Black men remain among the most reliable supporters of the party.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won 94% of Black female voters, compared to 82% among Black men, according to exit polling . The results reflected the long-standing loyalty that Black voters have had with Democrats.\n\nThat year, Trump won 4% of Black women votes while taking 13% of Black male votes. (Latino voters strongly backed Clinton, but both white men and white women overall supported Trump.)\n\nIn 2020, now-President Joe Biden won 92% of Black voters, compared to 8% for Trump, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nBut Obama and other Democrats are hoping to get ahead of what they see as Trump's potential to win over more Black voters - and especially Black men - this time around.\n\nThe newly released New York Times/Siena College poll showed that 78% of Black likely voters supported Harris, while Trump pulled in 15% support among Black likely voters. Such a result - if it stands in November - could be a boost for Trump in swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nBlack men in the Times/Siena survey backed Harris 70% to 20%, still a sizable advantage for the vice president, but indicative of erosion among this group toward the GOP. However, Black women remained strongly in Harris' corner, backing her by an 83% to 12% margin.\n\nWhile Obama's pitch may have rubbed some people the wrong way, Democrats know they need robust Black support to win in November.\n\nAnd the Times/Siena survey showed the work that lies ahead for Harris as she campaigns to succeed Biden in the White House.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Takeoff's untimely death in November sheds light on the music industry's role in the unfortunate trend of Black men dying young\n\nTakeoff, the 28-year-old member of the disbanded rap trio Migos, was fatally shot during the early morning hours of  November 1 while attending a private event at a bowling alley.\n\nHarris County's medical examiner ruled that Takeoff, whose real name is Kirshnik Khari Ball, was killed by bullets that struck him in the head and torso, while his label, Quality Control, claimed he was hit by a stray bullet in a statement .\n\nHis death came weeks after that of Philadelphia rapper PnB Rock in South Los Angeles in September, and months after 34-year-old Atlanta rapper Trouble died in Rockdale County, Georgia, in June. The deaths of these rappers shed light on a larger unfortunate trend of Black men in the spotlight dying young - many violently.\n\nSince 2018, at least one rapper is fatally shot each year, according to CNN .\n\nAccording to the independent news outlet The Conversation , violence accounts for 51% of rapper deaths and 51.5% of hip hop artist deaths. The life expectancy for male rappers and hip-hop artists was approximately 30 years old, per The Conversation.\n\nEven some of the Black men in hip-hop who do not die violently, still live relatively short lives.\n\n\"Gangsta's Paradise\" rapper Coolio died at age 59 in September, \"X Gon' Give It to Ya\" rapper DMX died at age 50 in April 2021 following a heart attack, DJ Kay Slay died from COVID complications at 55 years old in April.\n\nTheir deaths fall in line with data that suggests Black people - especially Black men - have a low life expectancy.\n\nAccording to KFF, a nonprofit organization focused on health policy and health journalism, the life expectancy for Black people sits at 71.8 years and 68 years for Black men. The figures are notably lower than the life expectancy of 77.6 years for White people and 78.8 years for Hispanic people. Environmental factors and social issues that affect Black men directly contribute to this. According to the American Public Health Association , \"racism is a driving force of the social determinants of health.\"\n\nMurders of young Black men in and outside of the spotlight transcend regional boundaries.\n\nNipsey Hussle was dropping off clothing to a friend, Chinx was heading home to his wife and children, Young Dolph was picking up his favorite cookies, Pop Smoke was chilling in the Hollywood Hills. None of them knew these everyday activities would lead to their deaths.\n\nIn a country where gun violence looms as an ever-present threat to the average person, being famous can make you a bigger target. But even rappers who take precautions by hiring security firms are in danger. Nipsey Hussle was accompanied by his friend and bodyguard J Roc when he was slain outside of his Marathon Clothing store in 2019.\n\nTools like social media have made the chance of navigating the entertainment world without encountering violence slimmer than ever.\n\nNicki Minaj, distraught by the death of PnB Rock, pleaded with the friends and family of rappers not to share their locations in real-time for fear of attacks.\n\nVan Lathan, a cultural critic and podcaster famed for going toe-to-toe with Ye about the origins of slavery, pointed to YouTube channels dedicated to chronicling \"beefs\" between warring parties. He described the web traffic derived from this sensationalized content as \"the final stage of the commodification of the Black body.\"\n\n\"What it's doing is making it a sport. Once something is a sport, you don't care about the player,\" added Lathan.\n\n\"There's a video of MO3 getting shot up on the freeway. There's a video of XXXTentacion and that situation, there's video of - not of the death of Pop Smoke, but of his dead body being taken out of the home. There's video of the altercation with King Von and what happened there,\" he continued.\n\nThose who are not musicians or notable in other ways do not immediately trend when their blood spills. \"If you are Black, nobody cares if you die unless you dunked a ball, unless you rapped songs, or unfortunately unless the police kill you.\"\n\nArtists across genres often share premonitions about their own death. But while a song like Beyonce's \"I was here\" is considered a reflection of a life well lived, a track like Shy Glizzy's \"Funeral\" also serves as evidence of hip-hop's morbidity by naysayers.\n\n\"It's something that started off, if I'm being honest, with the purest of intents, like, 'Hey, I'm from a really bad place. I'm from a really terrible place. And I'm going to make music that speaks to that terrible place or my experience.' That goes back very far. That's really not that much different than what Muddy Waters was doing,\" said Lathan.\n\nRappers are frequently blamed for their own death. Actor Lakeith Stanfield rebuked themes in gangster rap in the wake of Takeoff's murder.\n\n\"The dangerous toxicity associated with this glorified Black serial killer and killed music and imagery got people thinking it's cool to hurt those that look like them and ONLY them,\" wrote the \"Atlanta\" star.\n\nSimilarly, hip-hop and rap are often used as the fall guy for everyday violence.\n\nAnd after the deaths of Brooklyn rappers Jayquan McKenley and Tahjay Dobson, New York City Mayor Eric Adams declared a war on drill rap .\n\n\"We pulled Trump off Twitter because of what he was spewing. Yet we are allowing music [with the] displaying of guns, violence. We allow this to stay on the sites,\" Adams said in February, neglecting to mention the issues that foster the conditions artists make music about. He later met with rap artists in the area and clarified that his stance would be against \"Violent people who are using drill rapping to post who they killed, and then antagonize the people who they are going to kill.\"\n\nBut violence - particularly gun violence - existed before hip-hop was even conceptualized.\n\n\"In some respects, rap music and violence seem to go hand-in-hand,\" T La Rock's manager Scotty Morris, the manager of the late rapper T La Rock, told The New York Times in 1987 after his murder. \"But it's not the music itself, it's the environment. Violence was here long before hip-hop.\"\n\nWalter Kimbrough, interim executive director of the Black Man's Research Institute at Morehouse College, told Insider that the music industry can be dangerous - sometimes even promoting or selling violence.\n\n\"What the industry continues to reward is people who talk about violence. So I don't think we can be surprised then when violence becomes an integral part of the culture,\" Kimbrough, who has also taught a class called \"Hip-Hop, Sex, Gender, and Ethical Behavior\" at Dillard University, told Insider.\n\nTricia Rose wrote in her book \"The Hip Hop Wars\" that many esteemed artists of the genre rely on a \"gangsta-pimp-ho trinity\" in their music. This, Rose suggests, puts violence, sexism, and racism at the forefront of the genre.\n\n\"The problems facing commercial hip hop today are not caused by individual rappers alone; if we focus on merely one rapper, one song, or one video for its sexist or gangsta-inspired images we miss the forest for the trees,\" Rose writes.\n\nShe added that the genre is regarded by many as \"'proof' that Black behavior creates ghetto conditions.\"\n\nKimbrough argued that there's enough blame to go around for the violence the music highlights, pointing to the artists, the music industry executives, and the fans that listen to the music.\n\n\"I think you can have a legitimate and authentic critique. I think that's important to be able to do for anything, but I think we've got to be able to do that and then not be anti-Black,\" Kimbrough continued. \"It's like, no, we love Black people. We're tired of seeing Black people die. And I think we got to be present it like that.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Decades before 'Squid Game,' real-life segregation-era 'battle royals' made Black men and boys fight in mass brawls\n\n\" Squid Game \" took the world by storm in 2021, becoming Netflix's top show and a global phenomenon. The South Korean hit imagines a dystopia where desperate, cash-strapped people fight each other in a series of reinvented children's games for the enjoyment of the rich and powerful, until the last contestant standing wins a life-changing cash prize.\n\nWhile the Netflix generation has \"Squid Game,\" in the segregation era, white audiences across the US had brutal live shows called \"battle royals.\" And while, unlike the games in \"Squid Game,\" they weren't designed to be fatal, they were a brutal, racist spinoff in the history of combat for entertainment that took place as recently as the 1950s.\n\nThe Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Michigan has documented the battle royals . They involved groups of young Black men and boys who were made to fight one another in a boxing ring, often blindfolded, for the pleasure of a white audience. They had to attack one another in a melee until one man was left standing; he'd win a prize of a few dollars.\n\nThey were common at Fourth of July celebrations, boxing events, carnivals, and country fairs in the US in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nThe Jim Crow Museum's website includes numerous newspaper accounts and battle-royal promotional bills.\n\nOn September 27, 1950, the Lubbock Evening Journal in Texas reported that a Saturday night of entertainment had started with a \"negro battle royal.\"\n\nThe museum said the US military hosted many of these shows, where the participants were often enlisted men. The end of an Armistice Day celebration in Moorhead, Minnesota, in 1930, for example, involved a battle royal; the local newspaper reported that the \"rough and tumble affair\" involving 10 people \"turned out to be as advertised and kept the fans in a constant uproar.\"\n\nThe opening chapter of Ralph Ellison's classic 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\" (based on a short story by Ellison titled \"Battle Royal\" ) described a battle royal in chilling detail.\n\n\"Everyone fought hysterically,\" Ellison wrote in the short story. \"It was complete anarchy. Everybody fought everybody else. No group fought together for long. Two, three, four, fought one, then turned to fight each other, were themselves attacked.\"\n\nFranklin Hughes, a multimedia specialist at the museum, said he believes that the account in \"Invisible Man\" - and its place in America's literary canon - is a vital record.\n\nIt's a story of \"this intellectual young man who wants to present a speech to these influential white folks to win a scholarship to an all-Black university, so he goes to this event,\" Hughes said. \"He thinks he's going to have the opportunity to do that.\n\n\"But they put him in a ring and make them fight each other, these other Black kids, and the winner could then present themselves and their work. Then he is talking with the taste of blood in his mouth as he's presenting this intellectual argument to these people, just so that he can get an education.\"\n\nAccording to the wrestling-news website Cageside Seats , battle royals were popularized in 18th-century England as bare-knuckle bouts involving several fighters and later exported to the American colonies.\n\nDuring slavery in the US, a version of the battle royal was known as a \"free for all\" contest. The book \"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States\" describes the contests as recreation for enslaved people, involving participants with a 10-pound bag stuffed with cotton and rags beating their opponents until they were out of the fight.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the battle royal was given its grotesque racist twist. According to Cageside Seats , the New York State Athletic Commission banned them in 1911, describing them as \"revolting spectacles.\" But in several states they continued for decades, eventually dying out in the South with the rise of the civil-rights movement.\n\nHughes said these events would often target Black children going to carnivals with their friends, who'd be forced to fight against each other.\n\nThe soul superstar James Brown, who grew up in extreme poverty in South Carolina in the 1930s and '40s, recalled his experience in \" The Godfather of Soul: An Autobiography .\" The museum's website includes a passage:\n\n\"Because of my reputation the other kids always pointed me out to the white men who came around to recruit scrappy black boys to be in the battle royals they put on at Bell Auditorium. In a battle royal they blindfold you, tie one hand behind your back, put a boxing glove on your free hand, and shove you into a ring with other kids in the same condition. You swing at anything that moves, and whoever's left standing at the end is the winner. It sounds brutal, but a battle royal is really comedy. I'd be out there stumbling around, swinging wild, and hearing the people laughing. I didn't know I was being exploited.\"\n\nHughes said the battle royal's legacy of manufactured disunity and violent humiliation still reverberates through Black America.\n\n\"These would lead to internalized racism, or internalized bias, where you don't like yourself, you don't like your culture, your community,\" he said.\n\n\"It's within the whole list of things that happened, particularly during the Jim Crow era, which is still undermining a lot of communities today.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Playing 'Survivor' changed my life. Now, I hope to change the game by getting more Black people on the show.\n\nReality shows have always piqued my interest, even though I've often struggled to find cast members to relate to.\n\nThe first reality show I can remember being seriously invested in was \"The Real World: New York\" on MTV. The season I remember best featured the usual premise - seven strangers living in a house - but this time, the cast included two African American houseguests.\n\nI enjoyed that season a lot, but I felt disappointed the more I watched reality shows and saw casts lacking in diversity, with few people I could relate to.\n\nEventually, I discovered \"Survivor\" in church when the pastor announced that a member of our congregation, JoAnna Ward, would be on the next season of the show.\n\nWard didn't last as long as I'd hoped, but the stories that the series portrayed were enough to not only make me a \"Survivor\" fan but also inspire me to someday be on the show myself.\n\nI got to live out my dream. Now, I hope to encourage more Black players to try to get on the show.\n\nAfter finishing my master's degree, I began working for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a health communication specialist. While there, I came across a \"Survivor\" casting-call announcement.\n\nThe next day, I skipped work to travel to the safari park where the auditions were held.\n\nThe line was long, and I wasn't too surprised to be one of the only people of color there. I don't think \"Survivor\" was marketed in spaces of color the way it was on mainstream media, which feels predominantly occupied by a white populous.\n\nIn that crowd, I also felt that being the only Black man there would increase my chances of being cast. It did not.\n\nFor my audition, I spoke into a camera for about a minute - not enough time for whoever was watching to get the true essence of Davie Armstrong Rickenbacker.\n\nAfter bombing my live audition, I made a tape because I was serious about being on the show. I gathered a few of my friends and shot footage of me partying, working, being an outdoorsman, and spending time with my then-girlfriend.\n\nThe next day, I was asked to fly to Los Angeles for a series of interviews where I'd finally have the ears of casting directors.\n\nI got them laughing and even had a few tearjerker moments. By the time I left, I was confident that there was no way I wouldn't be chosen.\n\nBut then I got the call that I wouldn't be on the next season of \"Survivor.\"\n\nI was distraught. My main thought was, \"What more interesting Black guy do they have out there?\" (I didn't know at the time, but rumor has it that the \"more interesting\" Black guy was a former \"Survivor\" player's son , which made sense.)\n\nIt never occurred to me that CBS might cast multiple Black men on a season of \"Survivor.\" After all, it used to be a pretty rare occurrence, seen in about seven of the 36 seasons before my own.\n\nMonths went by, and I began to fall into a depression because I had made it that far only to be rejected. Then I got a call from one of the leading casting directors for the show, who told me I wouldn't be chosen for season 38, but there was a chance I could be on season 37.\n\nThe call ended, and after about 30 minutes of me on the edge of tears, she called back and told me to pack my bags for the 2018 season.\n\nI feel honored that I could live out my dream on national television and have my experience be received so well by millions of viewers.\n\nIn 2020, CBS committed to having 50% of the casts on its unscripted shows be people of color, and I want to keep pushing for even more. Now, I also play recruiter for the show, hoping to inspire and encourage more Black players to compete.\n\nI don't receive a paycheck or get a leg up on returning to the series someday. My real reward is gratitude and seeing someone I influenced to apply become a household name that I can root for at home.\n\nIt's an initiative I'll keep pushing, whether I'm using my \"Survivor\" airtime to wish for more Black people to watch the show, working with fellow former castaways to create petitions focused on anti-racism actions, or using my Twitter to encourage more Black people to apply to the series.\n\nMy love for reality television has come full circle. I went from wishing for more representation on reality shows to being a part of that representation to helping foster even more of it.\n\nCBS didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump spent years courting Black voters. Kamala Harris has undone much of his success in just 7 weeks\n\nFormer President Donald Trump in recent years has aimed to win over Black voters, who for decades have made up the Democratic Party's most reliable base of support.\n\nIn myriad polls taken throughout much of this year, Trump has attracted support from increasingly larger shares of Black voters when his opponent was President Joe Biden. And the incumbent's political woes were largely driven by disenchantment among young Black voters, who are not as loyal to Democrats as older Black voters and have been critical of his handling of the Israel-Hamas War.\n\nBut a new Washington Post-Ipsos poll of Black Americans showed that Vice President Kamala Harris has made serious headway in winning over Black voters, especially among the younger voters whom were lukewarm toward Biden's onetime reelection bid.\n\nThe survey was taken from Aug. 23 through Sept. 3.\n\nOverall, 69% of Black Americans said they were \"absolutely certain to vote\" in the November election, a bump from the 62% of Black respondents who said in April that they'd be certain to cast ballots in the fall.\n\nBoth figures are still below the 74% of Black Americans who in June 2020 said they were certain to head of the ballot box.\n\nBut there has been notable movement toward Harris among young voters.\n\nIn the latest survey, 77% of Black voters aged 18 to 29 said they'd back Harris, an uptick from the 59% of Black voters in this age group who in April indicated that they'd support Biden.\n\nOverall, nearly 82% of Black voters said they'd \"definitely\" or \"probably\" support Harris, an increase from Biden's 74% mark in April.\n\nIn 2020, Black voters not only catapulted Biden to the Democratic presidential nomination but handed him the White House, as he won 92% of the Black vote overall that fall, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nDuring that cycle, Biden - who campaigned on providing student-loan debt relief and tackling the coronavirus pandemic - also won handily among Gen Z voters and millennials.\n\nBut this year, Biden had battled low enthusiasm among Black voters, which was imperiling his chances in states like Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who has sought to win over Black men with an an emphasis on economic concerns and immigration, had previously sharpened his focus on this group given Biden's polling troubles.\n\nHarris' entry into the race has shifted this dynamic dramatically.\n\nA graduate of the historically Black Howard University and the first Black and Indian-American vice president in US history, Harris has mobilized Black women across the country with her candidacy.\n\nAnd Trump, who in July questioned Harris' racial identity at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, now finds himself a smaller band of Black voters to attract to his campaign.\n\nHarris' candidacy in a matter of weeks has made Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina competitive again for Democrats, pulling back Democratic-leaning voters who were cool toward Biden.\n\nTrump is hoping that economic concerns will bring in more Black voters to back his campaign, but Harris has narrowed the polling advantage that the former president long had on that key issue, another dynamic that is keeping this contest competitive.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The NFL ended a policy that assumed Black players had a lower cognitive function, which denied them settlements for head injuries\n\nThe NFL agreed to stop using the practice \"race-norming,\" which assumed Black players have a lower cognitive function than white counterparts, according to Maryclaire Dale of the Associated Press .\n\n\"Race-norming\" has prevented some retired Black players from qualifying for compensation in the NFL's $1 billion settlement of brain injury claims. In the original settlement, the NFL used a scoring algorithm for dementia testing that assumed Black men start with lower cognitive skills before the injury.\n\nBlack retirees would have had to score much lower than whites to qualify for a piece of the settlement.\n\nFor example, former Pittsburgh Steelers players Kevin Henry and Najeh Davenport were denied compensation for brain injuries based on their scores in the league's cognitive test to judge mental deficiency. But they each would have qualified for compensation based on their scores if they were white.\n\nHenry and Davenport were two of 50,000 former NFL players and family members of those players who signed the petition demanding equal compensation for Black former players who suffer from cognitive regression. The two ultimately filed a civil rights lawsuit which led to the NFL making the change on Wednesday.\n\nHenry and Davenport initially filed a lawsuit, but it was thrown out by Senior U.S. District Judge Anita B. Brody in Philadelphia. Brody later asked a magistrate judge to compile a report on the problem, which led to the petition's ultimate impact on the NFL's decision to make the policy change, according to the Associated Press .\n\nMore than 2,000 former players have applied for a piece of the settlement, but less than 600 have been compensated, according to a report released by the NFL. More than half of the players who have applied are black, according to the Associated Press .\n\nNow, a new panel of neuropsychologists, which includes three Back doctors, will propose a new testing regime to the court that will offer fair evaluation for the mental cognitive function of Black players.\n\n\"Race-norming\" has previously been used in medicine to evaluate socioeconomic factors that can affect someone's health.  However, the way the NFL used it was too simplistic and caused disproportionate discrimination toward former Black players, according to UCSF Memory neurology professor Katherine Possin.\n\n\"Because every Black retired NFL player has to perform lower on the test to qualify for an award than every white player. And that's essentially systematic racism in determining these payouts,\" Possin told the Associated Press .\n\nLawyer Christopher Seeger negotiated the original settlement with the NFL in 2013 and said earlier this year that he found no evidence of racial bias in the settlement policies. However, Seeger apologized for that assessment on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am sorry for the pain this episode has caused Black former players and their families. Ultimately, this settlement only works if former players believe in it, and my goal is to regain their trust and ensure the NFL is fully held to account,\" Seeger said in a statement.\n\nJump to"

I stand with my feet closer together. With my feet spread out, it looks like I'm taking a stance. And I use a softer voice.\"\n\nEvery day, African-American men consciously work to offset stereotypes about them - that they are dangerous, aggressive, angry. Some smile a lot, dress conservatively and speak with deference: \"Yes, sir,\" or \"No, ma'am.\" They are mindful of their bodies, careful not to dart into closing elevators or stand too close in grocery stores.\n\nIt's all about surviving, and trying to thrive, in a nation where biased views of black men stubbornly hang on decades after segregation and where statistics show a yawning gap between the lives of white men and black men. Black men's median wages are barely three-fourths those of whites; nearly 1 in 3 black men will spend time behind bars during his life; and, on average, black men die six years earlier than whites.\n\nSure, everyone has ways of coping with other people's perceptions: Who acts the same at work as they do with their kids, or their high school friends?\n\nBut for black men, there's more at stake. If they don't carefully calculate how to handle everyday situations - in ways that usually go unnoticed - they can end up out of a job, in jail or dead.\n\n\"It's a stressful process,\" Borders says.\n\nMelissa Harris Lacewell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, says it's at the heart of being a black American male.\n\n\"Black mothers and fathers socialize their sons to not make waves, to not come up against the authorities, to speak even more politely not only when there are whites present but particularly if there are whites who have power,\" she said.\n\nChess in the real world \"Most black men are able shift from a sort of relaxed, authentically black pose into a respectable black man pose. Either they develop the dexterity to move back and forth, or ultimately they flounder.\"\n\nIt's a lot like a game of chess, says 43-year-old Chester Williams, who owns Chester Electric in New Orleans. He has taught his three sons, ages 16, 14 and 11, to play.\n\n\"The rules of the game are universal: White moves first, then black moves,\" he said. \"Black has to respond to the moves that the whites make. You take the advantage when it's available.\"\n\nTwenty-year-old Chauncy Medder of Brooklyn says his baggy jeans and oversized T-shirts make him seem like \"another one of those thuggish black kids.\" He offsets that with \"Southern charm\" he learned attending high school in Virginia - \"a lot of 'Yes, ma'ams,' and as little slang as possible. When I speak to them (whites), they're like, 'Hey, you're different.\"'\n\nSuch skillful little changes in style aren't talked about much, especially not outside of black households - there's no reason to tip your hand. As Walter White, a black sales executive from Cincinnati puts it: \"Not talking is a way to get what you want.\"\n\nCoping strategies He recalled that, \"as a child, we all sat down with my mother and father and watched the movie 'Roots,\"' the groundbreaking 1970s television miniseries tracing a black family from Africa through slavery and into modern times.\n\nThe slaves were quietly obedient around whites. \"But as soon as the master was gone,\" he said, \"they did what they really wanted to do. That's what we were taught.\"\n\nHistorians agree that black stereotypes and coping strategies are rooted America's history of slavery and segregation.\n\nJay Carrington Chunn's mother taught him \"how to read 'Whites Only' and 'Negro Only' before she taught me anything else,\" said the 63-year-old, who grew up in Atlanta. \"Black parents taught you how to react when police stopped you, how to respond to certain problems, how to act in school to get the best grade.\"\n\nSchool is still a challenge, even from an early age.\n\nLast year, Yale University research on public school pre-kindergarten programs in 40 states found that blacks were expelled twice as often as whites - and nine out of 10 blacks expelled were boys. The report did not analyze the patterns, but some trace it to negative views about black boys.\n\nPerception: Young males = public enemies Black male children are often \"labeled in public schools as being out of control,\" said Lacewell, who studies black political culture and wrote \"Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought.\"\n\n\"If you're a black boy who is smart and energetic and always has the answer and throws his hand up in the air,\" she said, \"you might as a parent say, 'Even if you know the answer you might not want to make a spectacle of yourself. You don't want to call attention to yourself.\"'\n\nBill Fletcher still has nightmares about his third-grade teacher, a white woman who \"treated me and other black students as if we were idiots,\" he said. \"She destroyed my confidence.\"\n\nBut his parents were strong advocates, and taught him to cope by having little contact with teachers who didn't take an interest in him, said Fletcher, former president of TransAfrica Forum, a group that builds ties between African-Americans and Africa.\n\nAs black boys become adolescents, the dangers escalate. Like most teenagers, they battle raging hormones and identity crises. Many rebel, trying to fit in by mimicking - and sometimes becoming - criminals.\n\n\"They are basically seen as public menaces,\" Lacewell said.\n\nCounting the casualties Rasheed Smith, 22, a soft-spoken, aspiring hip-hop lyricist from the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, recently tapped his long fingers, morosely counting his friends killed in neighborhood violence in the last five years - 11 in all. Few spent much time beyond their blocks, let alone their neighborhood. Some sold drugs or got in other trouble and had near-constant contact with police.\n\nSmith has survived by staying close to his family. He advised: \"With police, you talk to them the way they talk to you. You get treated how you act.\"\n\nTwenty years ago, Carol Taylor's teenage son - now a lawyer - was mugged twice near their Brooklyn home, but police officers \"treated him like he had done the mugging,\" she said. She wrote and self-published \"The Little Black Book: Survival Commandments for Black Men\" filled with tips on how to deal with police: keep your hands visible, carry a camera, don't say much but be polite.\n\n\"Don't take this as a time to prove your manhood,\" wrote Taylor, a retired nurse and community activist who said she's sold thousands of the pocket-sized, $2 books.\n\nAnd more general advice: \"Learn to read, write and type, and to speak English correctly. This is survival, not wishful thinking. If you are going to survive in America, go to college!\"\n\nOne selective business program at historically black Hampton University in Virginia directs black men to wear dark, conservative suits to class. Earrings and dreadlocked hairstyles are forbidden. Their appearance is \"communicating a signal that says you can go into more places,\" said business school dean Sid Credle. \"There's more universal acceptance if you're conservative in your image and dress style.\"\n\nCorporate communications One graphic artist says he wears a suit when traveling, \"even if it's on a weekend. I think it helps. It requests respect.\"\n\nBut in the corporate world, clothing can only help so much, said Janet B. Reid of Global Lead Management Consulting, who advises companies on managing ethnic diversity.\n\nBlack men, especially those who look physically imposing, often have a tough time.\n\n\"Someone who is tall and muscular will learn to come into a meeting and sit down quickly,\" she said. \"They're trying to lower the big barrier of resistance, one that's fear-based and born of stereotypes.\"\n\nHaving darker brown skin can erect another barrier. Mark Ferguson has worked on Wall Street for 20 years. He has an easy smile and firm, confident handshake.\n\n\"I think I clean up pretty well - I dress well, I speak well - but all that goes out the window when I show up at a meeting full of white men,\" says Ferguson of New Jersey, who is 6-foot-4 and dark-skinned. \"It's because they're afraid of me.\"\n\n\"Race always matters,\" said Ferguson, whose Day in the Life Foundation connects minority teenagers with professionals. \"It's always in play.\"\n\nThe smile factor Fletcher knows his light brown skin gives him an advantage - except that he's \"unsmiling.\"\n\n\"If you're a black man who doesn't smile a lot, they (whites) get really nervous,\" he said. \"There are black people I run across all the time and they're always smiling particularly when they're around white people. A lot of white people find that very comforting.\"\n\nAll this takes a toll.\n\nMany black men say the daily maneuvering leaves them enraged and exhausted. For decades, they continuously self-analyze and shift, subtly dampening their personalities. In the end, even the best strategies don't always work.\n\n\"I've seen it play out many times\" in corporations, said Reid of Global Lead. \"They go from depression to corporate suicide. Marital problems can come up. He loses all self-confidence and the ability to feel manly and in control of his own fate.\"\n\nSherman James, a social psychologist at Duke University, studies how the stress of coping for black men can damage the circulatory system and lead to chronic poor health. Black men are 20 percent more likely to die of heart disease than whites, and they have the highest rates of hypertension in the world, according to the National Medical Association.\n\nWhat doesn't kill makes you stronger The flip side, black men say, is that many learn to be resilient. Ferguson recalls when a new Wall Street colleague, minutes after meeting him and hearing he grew up in a housing project in Newark, N.J., asked if he had been involved in \"any illicit activities\" there. He shrugged it off.\n\nOver the years, as he has earned promotions and built client relationships over the phone, he has learned to steel himself for face-to-face meetings - for clients' raised eyebrows and stuttered greetings when they see he is black.\n\n\"It just rolls off our backs - we grin and bear it. You can't quit,\" he said, sighing heavily. He vents his frustrations to mentors and relaxes with his wife and young children.\n\n\"Then you go back,\" he said, \"and fight the good fight.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Ferguson, Missouri, and cities across the country erupted in protest, and social media users mourned Brown, who was killed by a police officer.\n\nMackey waded through the social media hashtags circulating at the time: #BlackLivesMatter, #MikeBrown, #HandsUpDontShoot, all delivering hundreds of results with images exuding sadness, pain and frustration.\n\nThen, he typed in the hashtag #BlackMenSmile.\n\n\"It yielded zero results. I was angry and confused,\" Mackey said. He decided to take action. He thought, \"This is an opportunity to claim a space and make it a place where you can go and see and know there is another modality of existence. One of joy and reflections of our life.\"\n\n\"The hashtag #BlackMenSmile was an opportunity to take up a space that had not been claimed,\" he said.\n\nMackey made it his mission to promote images of men smiling and expressing joy amid the political turmoil. It quickly grew into a mini movement. Men across the country populated the hashtag with smiling images alongside vulnerable captions about personal growth and optimism. One man wrote that he smiles because he has \"hope that my situation will change.\" Another wrote , \"Thinking about how far I've come from one form of life to another, but knowing that I'm still the same kid that made his first playstation out of cardboard.\"\n\nOver the years, the small team of two - Mackey and the company's director of narrative media, Jeremiah Griffin - has grown the empowerment company from the ground up. Today, the brand's Instagram account has more than 100,000 followers and has expanded into apparel, with a line of sweatshirts and other items brandishing messages like \"Black Joy is Revolutionary.\"\n\nUnder the Black Men Smile umbrella is a pair of YouTube series, \"Je's Journal,\" which features discussions about fatherhood, relationships and faith, and \" Greenhouse Conversations ,\" a nature-themed exploration of Black mental health and spirituality.\n\nMackey's original mission was simple: \"It was about celebrating the way we saw ourselves. It was about placing value and emphasis and priority on what we have to say about ourselves and not the stories that are being told about us,\" he said.\n\nTheir company's largest collaboration came in 2024 when Target locations across the country briefly sold Black Men Smile apparel as part of Target's Black History Month collection. Nearly a year later, the collaboration is bittersweet, Mackey said, given the company's recent announcement that it will roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion programs , following suit with other large retailers including Walmart and Lowe's .\n\nMackey said that although the collaboration was a major accomplishment, he likely would not work with Target again as a result of its decision. \"I wouldn't choose to essentially condone that behavior by putting my brand in the store at this critical time,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm basing my decision on a principled argument of being in solidarity with the larger body, the larger movement, of Black people who are making conscious decisions\" about where to spend their money, he added.\n\nMackey and Griffin held an Instagram Live session last month where nearly two dozen social media followers were able to voice their opinions and frustrations over the DEI rollbacks. These community discussions will likely continue as the pair works to expand their \"Black joy\" movement under the new Trump administration.\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Trump signed an executive order to end all DEI initiatives in the federal government; moved to ban observances of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month, Juneteenth; targeted gender-affirming care , launched mass deportation efforts and more. Trump's early orders have sent shockwaves through progressive circles and grassroots organizations whose leaders say their work will be even more difficult under the new administration.\n\nThis, Mackey and Griffin said, makes their work more important than ever.\n\n\"The doubt, the fear, the uncertainty in our community just rises at times like this,\" Griffin said.\n\n\"With that being known, that's the work we do. In those times is when we come together, we rally, we use the platform we've created to encourage, to uplift, to reflect the joy that is inside and that we have access to, to re-empower our community, re-empower ourselves. The work remains the work.\"\n\nChar Adams is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

You can't imagine being what you don't see.\"\n\nLambert was one of eight black men to join the 2015 class at Brown University medical school - the men made up just under 7 percent of the student body that year, slightly above the national average of 6.5 percent, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges . He is now a fourth-year obstetrics and gynecology resident at the Howard University College of Medicine.\n\nEven with efforts to increase the number of minority ethnic groups in science and medicine, the proportion of black men pursuing and obtaining degrees in these fields has reached a historic low. In 1986, 57 percent of black medical school graduates were men - but by 2015 that number had dropped to just 35 percent, even as the total number of black graduates in all fields had increased. And that downward trend is expected to continue. In fact, fewer black men entered medical school in 2014 than in 1978 .\n\nAccording to a report released earlier this year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and the Cobb Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic groups and racism in medicine, more African-American students attend medical schools today compared with 30 years ago, but the increase is due to greater numbers of black women training to be physicians. The proportion of men among African-American medical students decreased by more than 38 percent over the same period.\n\nAnd while some believe that more black women are in medical school today because the women are outpacing the men academically, the data does not necessarily support that theory.\n\nBlack men men on average have higher scores on the medical college admission test, said Dr. Marc Nivet, Executive Vice President at UT Southwestern Medical Center, but fewer men are getting into medical school. \"So we have to ask ourselves, what are some of the additional barriers that black men face to get into medical school?\" said Nivet.\n\nDr. Louis Sullivan, president emeritus and founding dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine and the secretary of health under President George H.W. Bush, believes that history plays a big role in the current shortage of male African-American physicians.\n\n\"Blacks, and especially black males, have always been underrepresented in medicine,\" Sullivan told NBC News. \"This stems from slavery and legally enforced segregation.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"cost is as much an issue as anything. Given that many black men come from low-income families,\" the cost of attending medical school \"is too high a burden to put on their families.\"\n\nNivet believes that schools with a history of accepting greater numbers of black students are underfunded.\n\n\"The majority of black doctors come from only three or four historically black colleges and universities - Spelman, Howard, Xavier and Morehouse,\" Nivet said. \"Those institutions need more resources, both federal and philanthropic, based on their great and historic track record of sending African-Americans to medical school.\"\n\nBlack students often attend underperforming schools in urban areas or come from low-income families, or both. Even those who are successful in math and science or come from higher-income families are often discouraged from applying by misguided college counselors who cite the high cost of attendance and the perceived lack of preparedness they would encounter if accepted as reasons why.\n\n\"The obstacles start early and it's hard not to appreciate the interplay between socioeconomic status and race,\" Nivet told NBC News. \"To make matters worse, many black men don't have examples of black doctors in their lives. You can't imagine being what you don't see,\" he added.\n\nSullivan, 84, recounts the story of how he was introduced to medicine to highlight the importance of early exposure to the field.\n\n\"There was only one black physician in southwest Georgia when I grew up,\" Sullivan said. \"His name was Dr. Griffin and he was 44 miles away, in Bainbridge, Georgia. This was during the days of segregation, when black people were seen in separate hospitals or waiting rooms. Black people resented that. My father was an undertaker and operated a funeral home. As a side job he provided ambulance services in the black community. So I met Dr. Griffin with my father when he would bring him patients. I knew early on that I wanted to be like Dr. Griffin.\"\n\nDayle Hodge, 34, of Buffalo, New York, an M.D./Ph.D. candidate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, believes that stark barriers to entry in medicine exist at every level.\n\n\"As students, one of the primary obstacles is a lack of mentorship. Getting through medical training is difficult as it is, but it's even harder when so few people who have endured similar challenges are available to provide advice and support,\" Hodge said in an email.\n\nHodge, who also served as chairman of a subcommittee for diversity and inclusion at Einstein - an assignment ordinarily reserved for faculty - also notes that minority faculty members must often endure a 'minority tax', which includes taking on additional administrative tasks.\n\n\"These responsibilities are often disproportionately borne by underrepresented minority faculty in an attempt to advance diversity and inclusion initiatives, but these activities redirect valuable time away from duties required for academic promotion such as research and grant writing.

Through his website/blog, Notoriously Dapper , he shares body positive tips to help others find confidence.\n\n\"We all were made in various sizes and shapes for a reason. It's what makes us unique, beautiful and strong,\" he added. \"Too many people are being fed nonsense about how a body should look. The media's perception of beauty is unrealistic, but people aren't buying into it anymore.\"\n\nBrooks, 34, is a body positive advocate because he believes the standard of beauty in the African-American community is impossible to obtain.\n\nRelated: Body-shamed Olympic swimmer Robel Kiros Habte of Ethiopia gets waves of support\n\n\"If we expect for people to ever be able to love themselves we have to begin to affirm who they are even when who they are is different from typical beauty standards,\" he told NBC News. \"I want men to love who they are, right where they are. And if they would like to make some changes within themselves then do so, but to walk around every day hating the better part of yourself is poisonous!\"\n\nHe also created a blog called Bigguyflyy . Its purpose, he said, is to encourage men to love their bodies and push against the stereotype that all Black men have to be chiseled with six pack abs.\n\nDavis, Brooks, and even Mosley have all had stereotypes forced upon them most of their lives. For Mosley, 39, he had to deal with the assumptions made about him because of his height.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUMmJnllfVC\n\n\"Being that I'm 6'10\" I've stood apart from most of my peers my whole life,\" he said, adding that growing up he developed a distaste for sports because of the expectations forced upon him.\n\nHe created rahmosley.com to be a resource for other extremely tall men of color.\n\n\"Hopefully, my role in the body positivity movement is one that reaches the young man in high school who's extremely tall, but has no interest in sports. All because you are tall you do not have to fall into the stereotypes placed upon other tall men,\" he said. \"You can be a little awkward, goofy, and clumsy, and still be confident.\"\n\nThrough their digital dispatches, they provide wardrobe tips, suggest the best brands for the average man and even share tips for healthy living. Mosley has openly posted about being diagnosed as diabetic and the setbacks of working out with a back injury.\n\nLike Mosley, Davis was motivated by experience. Following an embarrassing shopping experience, he felt moved to create his blog. As a child, art and fashion were his two areas of interest. His blog also led him to write a book, \"Notoriously Dapper: How to be a Modern Gentleman with Manners, Style and Body Confidence.\"\n\nIn addition, he has been featured in a few ad campaigns, including an American Eagle Outfitters underwear ad.\n\nAmerican Eagle isn't the only brand taking notice. In May, Puma announced the launch of a plus size line which also includes plus size men. And while there are milestones being made to ensure that men of color are not left out, the work of body positivity has not always been pleasant.\n\nBrooks knows all too well. Someone attempted to call him out on social media for wearing a floral sport coat. \"No Man Should Ever Wear Flowers,\" the guy proclaimed. Brooks was not terribly bothered by the statement - he was actually more upset that the guy used a photo of him with his daughter rather than one of him alone.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVYIyZMloa1\n\n\"If you've been told all of your life that you are unattractive because of your body type, and that certain limitations should always be on you, oftentimes you can unconsciously begin to formulate ideas and opinions that support that ideology,\" he said, adding that stereotypes need to be crushed. \"We can't cry, show weakness, be vulnerable, or God forbid wear flowers. That's why it is so important that we begin to change the conversation regarding men of size.\"\n\nLee Jones, a photographer based in Atlanta, is doing his part. He is currently working on a photography project designed to show African American men expressing joy. He sees his project as part of the body positivity movement because it humanizes the regular, every day, black man.\n\n\"I often think about Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem, 'We Wear the Mask.' Black men must wear a mask each day - some self-imposed while other masks are forced on us,\" he said. \"We don't always get to lay our masks down and allow others to see our true joyful and happy selves. It's unrealistic, or even inhumane, to expect black men to always be 'hard' or 'angry' or 'menacing' 24-7 without laying down the mask and enjoying themselves. It is healthy to see to African American men being their true selves.\"\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Here's why.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nCalvin Lambert recalls entering an empty lecture hall as a first-year medical student, feeling overwhelmed and ill-equipped to handle the rigors of medical school and assimilation to a new environment.\n\nLambert, 31, who grew up in Roosevelt, New York, an ethnically and racially diverse community, wondered if he would ever fit in.\n\n\"I was concerned about how people would accept me; how much of my 'blackness' or 'black experience' did I need to suppress in order to build a social network,\" Lambert wrote in an email to NBC News. \"Would I ever feel like myself in this environment?\"\n\nHe waited anxiously to see if he would be the only black student in the class - an all-too-familiar experience as a pre-med student at New York University - but sighed in relief when he saw four other black men walk into the lecture hall.\n\n\"I was unnerved by the idea of 'forcing' myself to fit in to a culture that was seemingly the antithesis of who I am,\" said Lambert. \"So I was relieved to find people whom I could share this experience with ... people who looked like me, talked like me, and could understand me.\"\n\n\"Many black men don't have examples of black doctors in their lives. You can't imagine being what you don't see.\"\n\nLambert was one of eight black men to join the 2015 class at Brown University medical school - the men made up just under 7 percent of the student body that year, slightly above the national average of 6.5 percent, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges . He is now a fourth-year obstetrics and gynecology resident at the Howard University College of Medicine.\n\nEven with efforts to increase the number of minority ethnic groups in science and medicine, the proportion of black men pursuing and obtaining degrees in these fields has reached a historic low. In 1986, 57 percent of black medical school graduates were men - but by 2015 that number had dropped to just 35 percent, even as the total number of black graduates in all fields had increased. And that downward trend is expected to continue. In fact, fewer black men entered medical school in 2014 than in 1978 .\n\nAccording to a report released earlier this year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and the Cobb Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic groups and racism in medicine, more African-American students attend medical schools today compared with 30 years ago, but the increase is due to greater numbers of black women training to be physicians. The proportion of men among African-American medical students decreased by more than 38 percent over the same period.\n\nAnd while some believe that more black women are in medical school today because the women are outpacing the men academically, the data does not necessarily support that theory.\n\nBlack men men on average have higher scores on the medical college admission test, said Dr. Marc Nivet, Executive Vice President at UT Southwestern Medical Center, but fewer men are getting into medical school. \"So we have to ask ourselves, what are some of the additional barriers that black men face to get into medical school?\" said Nivet.\n\nDr. Louis Sullivan, president emeritus and founding dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine and the secretary of health under President George H.W. Bush, believes that history plays a big role in the current shortage of male African-American physicians.\n\n\"Blacks, and especially black males, have always been underrepresented in medicine,\" Sullivan told NBC News. \"This stems from slavery and legally enforced segregation.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"cost is as much an issue as anything. Given that many black men come from low-income families,\" the cost of attending medical school \"is too high a burden to put on their families.\"\n\nNivet believes that schools with a history of accepting greater numbers of black students are underfunded.\n\n\"The majority of black doctors come from only three or four historically black colleges and universities - Spelman, Howard, Xavier and Morehouse,\" Nivet said. \"Those institutions need more resources, both federal and philanthropic, based on their great and historic track record of sending African-Americans to medical school.\"\n\nBlack students often attend underperforming schools in urban areas or come from low-income families, or both. Even those who are successful in math and science or come from higher-income families are often discouraged from applying by misguided college counselors who cite the high cost of attendance and the perceived lack of preparedness they would encounter if accepted as reasons why.\n\n\"The obstacles start early and it's hard not to appreciate the interplay between socioeconomic status and race,\" Nivet told NBC News. \"To make matters worse, many black men don't have examples of black doctors in their lives. You can't imagine being what you don't see,\" he added.\n\nSullivan, 84, recounts the story of how he was introduced to medicine to highlight the importance of early exposure to the field.\n\n\"There was only one black physician in southwest Georgia when I grew up,\" Sullivan said. \"His name was Dr. Griffin and he was 44 miles away, in Bainbridge, Georgia. This was during the days of segregation, when black people were seen in separate hospitals or waiting rooms. Black people resented that. My father was an undertaker and operated a funeral home. As a side job he provided ambulance services in the black community. So I met Dr. Griffin with my father when he would bring him patients. I knew early on that I wanted to be like Dr. Griffin.\"\n\nDayle Hodge, 34, of Buffalo, New York, an M.D./Ph.D. candidate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, believes that stark barriers to entry in medicine exist at every level.\n\n\"As students, one of the primary obstacles is a lack of mentorship. Getting through medical training is difficult as it is, but it's even harder when so few people who have endured similar challenges are available to provide advice and support,\" Hodge said in an email.\n\nHodge, who also served as chairman of a subcommittee for diversity and inclusion at Einstein - an assignment ordinarily reserved for faculty - also notes that minority faculty members must often endure a 'minority tax', which includes taking on additional administrative tasks.\n\n\"These responsibilities are often disproportionately borne by underrepresented minority faculty in an attempt to advance diversity and inclusion initiatives, but these activities redirect valuable time away from duties required for academic promotion such as research and grant writing. Unfortunately these additional tasks are often not considered within the metrics for career advancement,\" Hodge said.\n\nBlack patients are more likely to feel comfortable with black doctors and more likely to adhere to certain preventive measures delivered by black doctors, research shows. And black doctors are more likely to practice in underserved communities.\n\nThis is especially important given that black men have the lowest life expectancy of any ethnic group in the United States because of higher rates of incarceration, lower socioeconomic status, and greater barriers to health care, resulting in higher rates of chronic disease.\n\n\"More black physicians in the system establishes trust in the system,\" said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, professor of psychiatry and dean of students at Harvard Medical School. An entirely white staff \"discourages black people from using those facilities,\" he said.\n\nHodge believes that reshaping academic medicine to make diversity and inclusion an integral part of the institutional fabric is essential to addressing this issue.\n\n\"Identifying high-achieving black men is critical,\" he said. \"This is easier when there is increased minority representation on admissions committees, in administrative leadership and in teaching positions.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC HEALTH ON TWITTER & FACEBOOK\n\nDr. Shamard Charles is a physician-journalist for NBC News and Today, reporting on health policy, public health initiatives, diversity in medicine, and new developments in health care research and medical treatments.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

According to the American Lung Association, one in 16 Black men will be diagnosed with lung cancer in their lifetimes, and only 12% are likely to be diagnosed at an early stage. Black men also have lower lung cancer survival rates, partially because of the low rates of early diagnosis.\n\nWhile 80% to 90% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. are linked to cigarette smoking, 10% to 20% of lung cancers occur in people who have never smoked tobacco or have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The New York Times , Braugher mentioned that he had given up smoking years ago.\n\nSome symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that never goes away, spitting up blood, shortness of breath, fatigue, pain in the chest area and weight loss. If lung cancer is caught at an early stage , treatments usually include surgically removing the cancerous tumor or stereotactic body radiotherapy , radiation that targets the cancerous cells, said Dr. Chi-Fu Jeffrey Yang, a thoracic surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nWhile stage one, the earliest stage, is the ideal time to detect lung cancer, Yang said there are people \"who are still living a really good life seven, eight years out after their diagnosis.\" This is because of tremendous advancements in lung cancer treatments, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\n\nNonsmokers who are diagnosed with lung cancer have most likely been exposed to certain environmental factors, such as pollution, said Yang, who is also an adviser at the American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative , an advocacy group dedicated to spreading awareness about the importance of early lung cancer screenings in high-risk patients. Other factors that increase risk in some people include exposure to fumes while cooking and their family history, he said.\n\nDr. Cedric \"Jamie\" Rutland, a national spokesperson for the American Lung Association a pulmonologist, agrees. \"Every breath that you take, you are snatching the environment that surrounds you,\" he said. Age is also a risk factor, he added.\n\nBut stigma co-exists with many lung cancer diagnoses. Yang said there is \"often a lot of blame\" placed on patients  because of the notion that only smoking causes the disease. He said that some of his own lung cancer patients tell people they have breast cancer instead, \"because breast cancer doesn't have that same stigma.\"\n\nThe screening initiative has \"been trying to emphasize that really anybody with lungs can get lung cancer,\" Yang said.\n\nThere's also a sense of fatalism about the disease, which also prevents many people from getting screened.\n\n\"They think that, 'I'm smoking. I'm going to get lung cancer. I'm going to die from lung cancer. What is the point of even getting screened?'\" he said. \"It's unfortunate because if you can catch lung cancer early, you can treat it early and actually have really, really good life afterwards.\"\n\nPreventing fatal health outcomes for Black men with lung cancer comes down to recognizing symptoms, adhering to early screenings, and cutting strict eligibility requirements for screenings, said doctors who spoke to NBC News.\n\nResearch from the journal BMC Cancer in 2020 said low income and being underinsured also contribute to low screening rates. Black patients who are at a high risk for lung cancer also miss more exams and delay follow-up visits more often when being referred for a screening, additional research suggested.\n\nEven workers trying to get to a screening can find themselves having to choose between not missing work or keeping an appointment during their doctor's office hours.\n\n\"You can't leave your job because it costs you money and you won't be able to support your family,\" Rutland said. \"You're not going. So, that's a lack of access.\"\n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force's criteria for lung cancer screenings includes being 50 to 80 years old, having a 20-pack a year smoking history, and currently smoking cigarettes or having quit within the past 15 years.\n\nEven with changes in eligibility requirements under the 2021 guidelines, research has found that 66% of Black women diagnosed with lung cancer would have still been ineligible for a screening, Yang said. As a result, the lung cancer screening initiative  recently launched a study with the goal of screening 400 Black women ages 50 to 80 for lung cancer.\n\n\"We've realized that a lot of the guidelines and a lot of the recommendations, it's really reliant only on data for white patients, or white study participants,\" Yang said.\n\nYang said he's been working with the screening initiative to help spread awareness about the importance of lung cancer screenings in Black communities across the U.S. by visiting health fairs and historically Black colleges and universities. His organization also holds interactive screening workshops and virtual presentations to raise awareness about lung cancer eligibility. At a September event at the University of Chicago, nearly 60 dining hall staff signed up for a lung cancer screening, Yang said.\n\nElsewhere, doctors have used materials from \"Know Your Risk,\" a program started by the Lung Cancer Research Foundation in collaboration with AME Church in 2021, to have conversations about lung cancer with their patients, said Aubrey Rhodes, the foundation's executive director.\n\nIn an email to NBC News, Rhodes said she hopes that the program will raise awareness within the Black community - \"if not among Black men themselves, the people in their lives who can influence them.\"\n\nRutland, of the American Lung Association, said he raises awareness about lung cancer screenings through his visits to a barbershop, where a lot of Black men like himself frequent.\n\n\"I just want people to be able to have access to even ask questions, 'Hey, I'm feeling this' or 'I'm feeling that' or 'Something's a little bit off,'\" Rutland said. \"That way they have access to understand what they should be doing.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nClaretta Bellamy is a fellow for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Ferguson, Missouri, and cities across the country erupted in protest, and social media users mourned Brown, who was killed by a police officer.\n\nMackey waded through the social media hashtags circulating at the time: #BlackLivesMatter, #MikeBrown, #HandsUpDontShoot, all delivering hundreds of results with images exuding sadness, pain and frustration.\n\nThen, he typed in the hashtag #BlackMenSmile.\n\n\"It yielded zero results. I was angry and confused,\" Mackey said. He decided to take action. He thought, \"This is an opportunity to claim a space and make it a place where you can go and see and know there is another modality of existence. One of joy and reflections of our life.\"\n\n\"The hashtag #BlackMenSmile was an opportunity to take up a space that had not been claimed,\" he said.\n\nMackey made it his mission to promote images of men smiling and expressing joy amid the political turmoil. It quickly grew into a mini movement. Men across the country populated the hashtag with smiling images alongside vulnerable captions about personal growth and optimism. One man wrote that he smiles because he has \"hope that my situation will change.\" Another wrote , \"Thinking about how far I've come from one form of life to another, but knowing that I'm still the same kid that made his first playstation out of cardboard.\"\n\nOver the years, the small team of two - Mackey and the company's director of narrative media, Jeremiah Griffin - has grown the empowerment company from the ground up. Today, the brand's Instagram account has more than 100,000 followers and has expanded into apparel, with a line of sweatshirts and other items brandishing messages like \"Black Joy is Revolutionary.\"\n\nUnder the Black Men Smile umbrella is a pair of YouTube series, \"Je's Journal,\" which features discussions about fatherhood, relationships and faith, and \" Greenhouse Conversations ,\" a nature-themed exploration of Black mental health and spirituality.\n\nMackey's original mission was simple: \"It was about celebrating the way we saw ourselves. It was about placing value and emphasis and priority on what we have to say about ourselves and not the stories that are being told about us,\" he said.\n\nTheir company's largest collaboration came in 2024 when Target locations across the country briefly sold Black Men Smile apparel as part of Target's Black History Month collection. Nearly a year later, the collaboration is bittersweet, Mackey said, given the company's recent announcement that it will roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion programs , following suit with other large retailers including Walmart and Lowe's .\n\nMackey said that although the collaboration was a major accomplishment, he likely would not work with Target again as a result of its decision. \"I wouldn't choose to essentially condone that behavior by putting my brand in the store at this critical time,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm basing my decision on a principled argument of being in solidarity with the larger body, the larger movement, of Black people who are making conscious decisions\" about where to spend their money, he added.\n\nMackey and Griffin held an Instagram Live session last month where nearly two dozen social media followers were able to voice their opinions and frustrations over the DEI rollbacks. These community discussions will likely continue as the pair works to expand their \"Black joy\" movement under the new Trump administration.\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Trump signed an executive order to end all DEI initiatives in the federal government; moved to ban observances of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month, Juneteenth; targeted gender-affirming care , launched mass deportation efforts and more. Trump's early orders have sent shockwaves through progressive circles and grassroots organizations whose leaders say their work will be even more difficult under the new administration.\n\nThis, Mackey and Griffin said, makes their work more important than ever.\n\n\"The doubt, the fear, the uncertainty in our community just rises at times like this,\" Griffin said.\n\n\"With that being known, that's the work we do. In those times is when we come together, we rally, we use the platform we've created to encourage, to uplift, to reflect the joy that is inside and that we have access to, to re-empower our community, re-empower ourselves. The work remains the work.\"\n\nChar Adams is a reporter for NBC BLK.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Here's why and what's being done\n\nBy\n\nJuana Summers\n\n,\n\nJason Fuller\n\n,\n\nPatrick Jarenwattananon\n\nMembers of the class of 2016 are presented with their degrees during the commencement ceremony at Howard University in May, 2016. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe absolute number of Black men enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is the lowest it's been since 1976.\n\nThat's according to recent analysis from the American Institute for Boys and Men , which crunched data from the Department of Education.\n\nIn fact, Black men now currently account for only 26% of the students at HBCUs - back in 1976, that figure was 38%.\n\nAll Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Calvin Hadley - assistant provost for academic partnerships and student engagement at Howard University - about what's happening, what's lost when Black men don't attend HBCUs, and how he is trying to close this gap.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nJuana Summers: I want to start by talking about Howard, which, of course, is one of the foremost HBCUs in this country - a long, long list that I cannot recite of incredible alumni, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Let's start there. Are you seeing this decline among Black male students where you are?\n\nCalvin Hadley: I am. I'm a Howard alum, and so I remember as a student, the numbers were also pretty stark at that time. I think we were around 33-34% when I was a student, between 2004 and 2008. Now, as you announced in your introduction, Howard University is around 25% male total. And I think a recent statistics said around 19% Black male. And so that is felt on campus, that is felt, I think, in our social clubs, it's felt on the yard. And I think many of our male students have commented that in some of their classes, they're the only male in their class.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris greets supporters at a campaign rally at South Carolina State University in February.

I attended a PWI - a predominantly white institution - but I have so many friends and family members who attended HBCUs. They talk to me about what that experience has meant to them, not just while they're on campus, but when they go out into their professional lives. They stay connected to the HBCU experience. They stay connected to communities like the Howard community that you represent. So I just want to ask you, when there are fewer Black men on campus, walk us through: what does that mean? What do we lose when those Black men are not as robust a presence on campuses like yours?\n\nHadley: By the time students actually come to college, we're dealing with the males that have actually transcended what we call the \"belief gap\" - this gap in between what students can actually achieve and what their professors, teachers, counselors believe they can achieve. For Black males, that gap is the largest. When they get into the campus, the campus experiences are significantly impacted by the imbalance, right?\n\nAt every educational institution, we want a diversity of experience. And so when you don't have as many males in the classroom, that diversity of experience is significantly impacted. It gets even more scary when we trace it forward, right? I think we're dealing with some really unique statistics right now. Black males are graduating at a much lower rate than Black females.\n\nSummers: And that's across all colleges.\n\nHadley: Across all colleges, not just HBCUs. And so this drop in the past decade has been seen more drastically. But the reality is, this is not a Howard problem. This is not an HBCU problem. This is not a PWI problem. This is an American education problem.\n\nSummers: I want to shift gears a bit and talk about what happens when these Black men are graduating from high school and they're deciding what comes next, what that next step is. The study that we've been talking about, it notes that since 2010, as you point out, Black male enrollment has gone down across all colleges. And it also points out that HBCU enrollment has also decreased on the whole, but the decline of Black male enrollment at HBCUs outpaces those trends, if only slightly. Can you just explain to me how you understand that gap?\n\nHadley: So I want to take a small step back. In 2013-14 we had 2990 male applicants for Howard University specifically. In 2022-23 we had 9705. A significant, significant increase.\n\nHoward University graduates arrive for the 2023 Commencement Ceremony in May, 2023. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\nSummers: And what does that say to you?\n\nHadley: That the Howard University education, and the HBCU education, is highly sought after, right? And there are a number of really important things that happened between 2012 and 2022 - one of those was the election of President Donald Trump, another was the murder of George Floyd. I think when those things happen in the United States of America, the HBCU experience, which had already been known to many of us, had now become a much more attractive proposition. You notice a significant increase in those male applications.\n\nWhat I didn't provide you was the number of female applications that accompany that. While we received 9700 male applications in 2022-23, we received upwards of 30,000 female applications. And I want to take a step aside and say Black women are ripping it up. All the statistics show, from high school to college to college graduation, that the Black women is successful today, and the trajectory is going straight up. Unfortunately, when you look at the Black male, the exact opposite is the case. And so for those Black males that are now being left out of the college equation, that also means they're being left out and stratified out of a certain portion of our society.\n\nWhat we now will have is an imbalance in the community that has a significant impact on our ability to create whole families, I think. On the ability for us to ensure that our generations after us have additional success, and really to have additional mobility.\n\nSummers: I want to end on this: You are a product of Howard University, as you point out. You now work for the university. And you're raising two young Black boys. What's your pitch for why a young Black man who might be hearing our conversation in 2024 should choose to attend an HBCU?\n\nHadley: Wow. Thank you for that. You attend an HBCU for an education and not a degree, and as an assistant provost, that's not a popular thing to say. The education that you receive in an HBCU transcends the classroom experience. It transcends the relationship that you have with your professor. The education exists in between the lines of the pages. HBCUs inundate you with the sense of belief. We talked about the importance of that belief on the front end, the belief gap that exists in K through 12.\n\nHBCUs are created to instill you with the belief that you can be even larger than you can dream. Howard University and the HBCU community has provided me - and many other people, like our vice president - with the sense that I am enough. I can be successful academically. But my world is not simply academics. I can be enough and I can contribute to this society, in this space, in a way that allows me to feel whole and allows me to contribute to something much larger than myself. The HBCU community needs you. And so when I'm talking to that young man in 2024: Come because we need you. Come because you're important. Come because without you, our community is hurt.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "What the Harris campaign is doing to try to win over more Black men\n\nTamara Keith\n\nCherita Evans aka Storm the Barber, with Christian Pounds in her chair at Head Changerz Barber Lounge in Rocky Mount, N.C. on May 23, 2024. Andrea Ellen Reed for NPR hide caption\n\nROCKY MOUNT, N.C. - From behind her barber chair and in her community, Cherita Evans - who goes by \"Storm the Barber\" - has picked up on a troubling trend for Vice President Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Most of my female family and friends - they're voting for Harris,\" Evans said in an interview at the Head Changerz shop last week. But she said some of the men in her life aren't so sure. \"I think ... a lot of men aren't ready to vote for a woman.\"\n\n\"In my community, you have a lot of men, who, you know, won't even be under a female leadership in church,\" said Evans.\n\nThis is a problem the Harris campaign is racing to address as early voting begins in key states where every vote will count. Polls show former President Donald Trump may be making some inroads with Black male voters - and other Black men may not vote .\n\nThat's why on Tuesday Harris will be taking questions from callers in swing states in a town hall conversation moderated by Charlamagne tha God, an influential Black radio host who has pulled very few punches with Democratic politicians.\n\nThe challenge was underscored by former President Barack Obama this week . He spoke what he called \"some truths\" about how energy and turnout for Harris in Black communities was not what it was when he was running - and said that it \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\"\n\n\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said.\n\nHarris' campaign is working to engage Black male voters, including hosting tailgate events at homecomings at historically Black colleges. Harris also had a conversation on All the Smoke , a podcast hosted by two former NBA stars, where she talked about her identity - something she hasn't often leaned into on the campaign trail.\n\nThis weekend, Harris is in North Carolina meeting local Black leaders. On Sunday, she plans to attend a church service in Greenville, and later hold a rally. The city is in Eastern North Carolina, a section of the state with a large Black population, but where turnout among those voters has lagged in recent years.\n\nHer path to the presidency runs through communities like Rocky Mount, where NPR first met Evans back in May .\n\nAt that time, Evans was less than enthusiastic about the election, saying she didn't like Trump or Biden. Evans was disappointed that Harris had disappeared from the spotlight.\n\n\"After she became vice president, it seemed like she just kind of got quiet,\" said Evans.\n\nEvans said she thinks Harris is a better candidate than Biden - but not perfect.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest with you: I don't really like Trump, so I am going to vote for her,\" said Evans. \"But I don't think she's done a very great job of addressing the main issues that we are having.\"\n\nLike so many voters this year, Evans says gas prices are high and groceries are too expensive. She sees Harris talking about going after companies for price gouging in the ads that show up constantly on the TV in the barbershop - but Evans doesn't buy that as a real solution.\n\nBack in May, Evans was cutting the hair of Christian Pounds, a 22-year-old college student. At the time he didn't like either candidate and didn't think his vote would change anything.\n\nReached on the phone this week, he said he's definitely planning to vote. \"When Biden dropped out, I was kind of happy,\" Pounds said, explaining he thought Biden was too old for the job.\n\nThe other night, Pound says he got into a heated discussion with his uncle and his cousin about voting. His cousin isn't planning to vote. \"My uncle was like, 'You better vote for Kamala Harris.'\"\n\nPounds said he sees a real generational divide among his friends and family - \"the young people vs. the old, when it comes to voting vs. not voting,\"\n\nIn the neighboring community of Wilson, Mike Harris is a barber at Style Masters. He's been voting for Democrats all his life, and said he hopes Harris will become the first female president.\n\nBut the same isn't true for all of his clients and friends\n\n\"Some people - I don't know if they joking or not - say they are\" voting for Trump, said Mike Harris.\n\n\"Some people don't believe in female leaders, but I tell them all the time ... my mom raised me and my brother in our house. So I think that, you know, women can do the job,\" Mike Harris said.\n\nNPR's Jason Fuller and Gus Contreras contributed to this story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Black men have a unique relationship with fashion, one that can be traced all the way back to the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nMonica L. Miller, the author of Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, spoke with Tell Me More's Michel Martin about the past, present and future of black men's fashion.\n\nMiller, an associate professor of English at Barnard College, explains that African-American men have used style as a way to challenge stereotypes about who they are. \"Sometimes the well-dressed black man coming down the street is asking you to look and think.\"\n\nVictor Holliday, associate producer of on-air fundraising at NPR and one of the resident kings of style, tells Martin that he learned about the importance of fashion at an early age. \"When I was 5 years old, I knew exactly how I was going to look,\" he says. \"And that was the year I got my first trench coat and my top hat.\"\n\nHolliday's style icon is his father, who taught him that the main object of dressing up is winning respect. \"Because as you present yourself seriously, people tend to take you seriously.\"\n\nHolliday is one of the men featured in Tell Me More 's Kings of Style slideshow.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Lauren Silverman/KERA hide caption\n\nJeffrey Okonye (left) and Oviea Akpotaire are fourth-year medical students at the University of Texas Southwestern.\n\nOviea Akpotaire and Jeffrey Okonye put in long days working with patients at the veterans' hospital in south Dallas as fourth-year medical students at the University of Texas Southwestern.\n\nThey're in a class of 237 people and they're two of only five black men in their class.\n\n\"I knew the ones above us, below us,\" Okonye says. \"We all kind of know each other. It's comforting to see another person that looks like you.\"\n\nWhile more black men graduated from college over the past few decades, the number of black men applying to medical school has dropped . In 1978, 1,410 black men applied to medical school and 542 ended up enrolling. In 2014, both those numbers were down - 1,337 applied and 515 enrolled.\n\nThose figures come from a report from the Association of American Medical Colleges . Every other minority group - including Asians and Hispanics - saw growth in applicants. There was also an uptick in applications by black women.\n\nEnrollment statistics for 2015 are just out and they show a modest gain of 8 percent more black men entering medical school over the year before.\n\n\"This is a positive sign,\" says Marc Nivet, AAMC's chief diversity officer, \"but it does not change the fact that for 35 years the number has been trending poorly.\"\n\n\"I was really surprised,\" says Akpotaire, who is studying internal medicine. \"I sent [the study] to my mom and dad immediately. You would think the conditions would be a lot different than they were in 1978.\"\n\nDiversity among doctors is important for patient health. People are more likely to follow doctors' directions on things like medication or exercise if they can identify with them.\n\nDr. Dale Okorodudu, a third-year pulmonary and critical care fellow at UT Southwestern, says making cultural connections can make a big difference.\n\n\"If you can relate to [patients], it's a lot easier for them to feel at home and comfortable with you,\" he says.\n\nOkorodudu wrote a blog post about an experience at Parkland Hospital that stuck with him. He was walking down the hallway on the 10th floor when a black man stopped him:\n\n\"It's good to see you brother!\" I had never met this man, but I knew exactly what he was talking about. With a large smile on his face and a look of pride, he extended his arm to give me a handshake. \"There aren't too many of us doing what you do. I'm glad we got some representation in here.\"\n\nFor years, Okorodudu has been trying to figure out why so few black men go into medicine. His conclusion: the lack of role models.\n\n\"If you're a black male, let's say you're growing up in an inner-city neighborhood,\" he says. \"There's so many things directly in front of you that you have the option to go into.\"\n\nThe options range from music and sports to small business and church, Okorodudu says those professions are visible and present in the lives of young African-American boys. \"But when you talk about the medical workforce, none of us are directly there in front of them,\" he says.\n\nOkorodudu decided to become a doctor when he was 18. A year from now, when he's done with his fellowship, he'll be 32.\n\nMed student Jeffrey Okonye points out that for students like him, who embraced math and science, there are much faster ways to \"make it.\"\n\n\"A lot of friends of mine, black males, are engineers,\" Okonye says. \"They go to school for four years. They have a job, great pay, even had internships in undergrad I was highly jealous of. Whereas my route, four years undergrad, then another four years of school, and then another X amount of training after that.\"\n\nSo why did he take the longer route?\n\n\"It's hard to describe the feeling you get when you make someone actually feel better,\" Okonye says. \"When you can see them go from one state to another and recognize that you were a part of literally changing this person's life.\"\n\nA desire to care for others isn't the only thing that Okonye, Akpotaire and Okorodudu have in common. All three have had doctors or nurses in their families. And all three are the children of immigrants from Nigeria. Okorodudu says that means the group of black men who are applying to medical school now is very different from the group in 1978.\n\n\"In 1978, those people we're looking at, a lot of them were probably black American males\" whose families had been in this country for generations, he says. Today's black medical school students may be more recent immigrants from Nigeria or the Caribbean, he says. \"So if we broke it down that way, that factoid is actually even more alarming.\"\n\nThe AAMC report suggests how to restock the doctor pipeline. Among the ideas: create more mentoring programs, expand financial aid options, and persuade medical schools to put less emphasis on standardized tests scores like the MCATs.\n\nOkorodudu is trying to help with an online service called DiverseMedicine . Users connect with mentors on chat or video.\n\nSometimes, he says, the key to getting kids interested is simply seeing a black man in a white coat.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership that includes NPR, local member stations and Kaiser Health News .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jermaine is 16 years old and bi-racial, with a dark complexion. He also has autism and wants to be more independent, especially as he nears adulthood.\n\n\"It's my worst nightmare,\" she says. \"I have the issue with him not understanding, possibly, a command to put your hands up or to get on the ground. So, yes, it's scary.\"\n\nAccording to the advocacy group Autism Unites, people with autism spectrum disorders are seven times more likely to interact with police over their lifetimes, compared with people without a cognitive disorder.\n\nChris Akubuilo meets members of the Culver City, Calif., police department. Akubuilo has autism, and his mother is worried about his safety when he interacts with police. Rebecca Hersher/NPR hide caption\n\nChris Akubuilo meets members of the Culver City, Calif., police department. Akubuilo has autism, and his mother is worried about his safety when he interacts with police.\n\nThat's particularly scary for parents already concerned about racial profiling. Michelle Smith's 28-year-old son Chris Akubuilo has severe autism and often struggles with both comprehension and speaking.\n\n\"He's black, male and autistic,\" she says. \"[I] never know if he'll be accosted. You ask questions later and you shoot first. It's happened too many times all over this nation.\"\n\nIn an effort to keep their kids safe, these mothers and their sons attended a seminar this week in Culver City, Calif., for people with autism spectrum disorders.\n\nThe goal is to teach people with autism how to interact safely with police - the event was co-sponsored by local law enforcement - and avoid misunderstandings that could lead to confusion or violence. Over the course of two hours, participants watch a movie called Be Safe , which explains basic vocabulary like \"law\" and \"arrest\" and includes dramatizations of police interactions.\n\nBetween sections of the movie, police and participants also do role-playing exercises. In one, police and people with autism pair off to practice scenarios such as how to ask for help getting home, or what to do if someone is harassing you.\n\nPolice officers also explain their uniforms. \"Never, ever, ever touch an officer's gun,\" Lieutenant Jason Sims explains to the group.\n\nAll the exercises are meant to make police seem less threatening, and to provide a forum for people to ask officers questions.\n\nThe seminar was organized in large part by Emily Iland, who has an autistic son and also teaches special education at California State University. The seminar is the civilian counterpart to a larger curriculum for law enforcement, which is free for all local police departments and state law enforcement agencies in California.\n\nThe biggest police department to pick it up so far is one with a history of a less-than-perfect relationship with the community: the LAPD. More than half its officers have now gotten some training about the symptoms of cognitive disabilities like autism. As part of a partnership with the Autism Society of Los Angeles, many officers also spend an entire day with autistic teens.\n\nThe Director of Police Training for the LAPD, Luann Pannell, says that program has helped officers feel less threatened by people with autism who, for example, might not make eye contact during an interaction.\n\n\"What we want to do is take the officers beyond a 5-minute encounter,\" she explains. \"In policing, a lot of these encounters happen very quickly.\"\n\nPrograms like this have drawn national attention. In July, the Justice Department announced it's working on a full training curriculum to educate local police officers about cognitive disorders.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

But Racism Sabotages Benefits For Black Men\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nVirginia Anderson\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University. Paula Burch-Celentano/Tulane University hide caption\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University.\n\nMore education typically leads to better health, yet Black men in the U.S. are not getting the same benefit as other groups, research suggests.\n\nThe reasons for the gap are vexing, experts say, but may provide an important window into unique challenges Black men face as they try to gain not only good health but also equal footing in the U.S.\n\nGenerally, higher education means better paying jobs and health insurance, healthier behaviors and longer lives. This is true across nearly all demographic groups. And studies show life expectancy is higher for Black men with a college degree or higher, compared with those who have not finished high school.\n\nBut the increase is not as big as it is for whites. This comes on top of the many health obstacles Black men already face. They are more likely to die from chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer than white men, and their average life expectancy is lower. Experts point to a variety of factors that might play a role, but many say the most pervasive is racism.\n\nResearchers note that while Black men and women face many of the same challenges, Black women generally have a longer life expectancy than Black men . (They also point out that for now it is difficult to draw conclusions about Hispanic people because of a lack of studies on these issues.) As a result, many experts say that these health problems stem from a persistent devaluation of Black men in U.S. society.\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hide caption\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it\n\n\"At every level of income and education, there is still an effect of race,\" says David Williams , a professor of public health at Harvard University who decades ago developed a scale that quantified the connection between racism and health .\n\nThe precise difference in health gains between educated white men and educated Black men is hard to pinpoint because of differences in study designs. Some studies, for example, look at life expectancy, while others look at disease burden or depression.\n\nExperts say, however, that the evidence is strong and convincing that these gaps have persisted over many years. A 2012 study published in Health Affairs , for example, found that life expectancy for white men with the most education was 12.9 years longer than for white men with the least education. For Black men, the difference between the most and least educated was 9.7 years.\n\nIn addition, other research shows how that gap plays out. A 2019 study examined the difference in years of \"lost life\" - years cut off because of health challenges - between the groups. Educated Black men lost 12.09 years of life expectancy, while educated white men lost 8.34 years, according to the study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior .\n\nRacism affects Black men's health and it is persistent, experts say.\n\n\"No matter how far you go in school, no matter what you accomplish, you're still a Black man,\" says Derek Novacek , who has a doctorate in clinical psychology from Emory University and is now at UCLA researching Black-white health disparities.\n\nS. Jay Olshansky , a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois in Chicago and lead author of the 2012 study, says possible risk factors for various diseases and environmental issues could also play a role.\n\n\"I'd be very surprised if this wasn't part of the equation,\" he says. \"The risk of diabetes and obesity is much higher among the Black population, even those that are highly educated.\"\n\nAmong other possible causes that researchers are probing are stress and depression.\n\n\"When you follow other groups with more education, depression declines,\" says Dr. Shervin Assari , who studies race, gender and health and is associate professor of medicine at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science outside Los Angeles. \"But when you look at Black men - guess what? Depression goes up .\"\n\nDepression is often an indicator of physical well-being as well as a contributing factor to many chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes.\n\nIsolated at Home and Work\n\nResearchers who study the health of various racial and ethnic groups, as well as the social factors that influence health outcomes, see cause for concern. The findings suggest that the power of discrimination to harm Black men's lives may be more persistent than previously understood. And they could mean that improving Black men's health may be more complicated than previously believed.\n\n\"What has surprised me is how powerfully and consistently discrimination predicts poor health,\" says Williams.\n\nCOVID-19 has underscored the issue. As early as last April researchers noticed higher death and hospitalization rates for Black people. The patterns have continued: Black patients are nearly two times as likely as whites to die of the virus, while Black men have the highest rates of COVID deaths .\n\nThe COVID outcomes, Williams and others suggest in interviews, helped point out that the health and well-being of middle-class, educated Black men may have been overlooked.\n\nHigher education hasn't brought about the health equity many experts had expected. While Black men have worse health than other groups if they are not educated, the data show they don't catch up to their white peers even when they are.\n\n\"What society has done to Black men is to corner them,\" Assari says.\n\nBlack men, even with an education, have less of a financial and social safety net than white men and that brings added stress, experts say. Also, as Black men climb corporate, academic or managerial ladders, many feel isolated. And social isolation is linked to poor health.\n\nThomas LaVeist , a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University, says that in a white-dominated society, Black men are less likely to have accumulated social capital - for example, family members with high incomes or social and business connections - who can open doors for them.\n\nAnd once hired into the workplace, they are less likely to have mentors, LaVeist says, and that lack of connections is associated with stress, depression and other factors that can lead to poorer health.\n\n\"There needs to be a designated effort to provide an on-ramp\" for Black men, he says.\n\nNo matter what stage of life, or level of achievement, most have experienced an excess of cumulative adversity and continued racism.\n\n\"Your high socioeconomic status doesn't protect you from the impact or from the incidence\" of racism, says Dr. Adrian Tyndall , associate vice president for strategic and academic affairs at University of Florida Health.\n\n\"That is difficult,\" adds Tyndall, who is Black. \"If I were to walk out of this institution and into the community, where people don't know me, I could be called the N-word. And yeah, that's pretty depressing.\"\n\nThe Need to Prove Yourself\n\nThe cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically - but so does the anticipation of it.\n\n\"It's not just the actual exposure in dealing with these kinds of experiences, but it's 'What do you do before leaving home?' You're careful about your dress, your behavior, the way you look because of the threat of discrimination, and so you react,\" says Williams, the Harvard professor.\n\nFor example, when Williams, who is Black, first became a professor at Yale University, he wore a coat and tie every day. No one else in his department did that.

      "text": "Opinion: How Policing Black Boys Leads To The Conditioning Of Black Men\n\nBy\n\nKristin Henning\n\n,\n\nAngela J. Davis\n\nTomiko Shine holds up a picture of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington, D.C. Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption\n\nTomiko Shine holds up a picture of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington, D.C.\n\nMistrust and alienation between black men and the police have become so entrenched that we need radical, sweeping change. The collective experience of black men in the criminal justice system is sobering. African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites, and numerous studies have shown that black men are disproportionately targeted , stopped, frisked, and searched through the practice of racial profiling. Black men end up in prison more often, receive longer sentences than similarly situated white men, and are more likely to be killed during police encounters than white men - 21 times more likely.\n\nBut, as criminal defense attorneys, we can attest to the fact that as harshly and as unfairly as black men have been treated in the criminal justice system, the fate of black boys has been worse.\n\nDecades of data show that the journey to racial disparity begins when black men are boys. Black boys are policed like no other demographic. They are policed on the street, in the mall, in school, in their homes, and on social media. Police stop black boys on the vaguest of descriptions - \"black boys running,\" \"two black males in jeans, one in a gray hoodie,\" \"black male in athletic gear.\" Young black males are treated as if they are \"out of place\" not only when they are in white, middle-class neighborhoods, but also when they are hanging out in public spaces or sitting on their own front porches.\n\nAdolescence is a critical time during which young people come to understand and respect or resent the law and legal institutions. Negative attitudes about the police acquired during childhood and adolescence have a \"lasting\" effect as youth transition to adulthood. The long history of aggressive and biased interactions with the police - perceived or real - has socialized a generation of black boys to avoid contact with the police whenever possible and if not, to be hostile - sometimes outright confrontational - with police.\n\nBlack boys who congregate on the \"corner\" attract the attention of the police day or night. Even when they \"dress nicely\" or \"drive nice cars\" young black males cannot avoid police surveillance since such signs of wealth among black youth are presumed to be associated with drug dealing. Black boys describe their neighborhoods as over-policed and say officers stop them multiple times a day to pat them down and ask questions like \"Where are you coming from?\" and \"Where are you going?\"\n\nThese stories are significant not only for the debilitating and conditioning impact they have on these youth, but also for the message they send to black boys.\n\nVideotaping, cursing, ignoring an officer's orders and running away provoke even greater hostility, disrespect and often physical force from the police. Not surprisingly, black youth are more likely to experience a use of force than white youth.\n\nBlack boys are angered not only by the frequency with which they are stopped, but also by the treatment they experience during these stops. They describe police as belligerent and antagonistic and are especially outraged by the officers' use of racial slurs, profanity and demeaning terms like \"punk\" and \"sissy.\" They complain about police stops that are too often initiated by physical contact such as grabbing, pushing, shoving, pulling or tackling the youth to the ground.\n\nOnce on the ground, black boys are sometimes held down by multiple officers who sit or lie on them while other officers kick, punch or mace them. More violent encounters include billy clubs or chokeholds like the one that killed Eric Garner in New York . Victims of police violence include black boys like LaQuan McDonald, Tyre King, and most recently Jordan Edwards. Fear of violence by police is now the norm for black boys.\n\nIn a recent study of police perceptions of childhood innocence, researchers showed police officers a series of photographs of young white, black and Latino males engaged in some purported criminal activity and asked them to estimate the age of each child. While the officers overestimated the age of adolescent black felony suspects by 4.59 years, they underestimated the age of adolescent white felony suspects by one year. Because of these types of distorted perceptions, black boys are more likely to be treated as adults much earlier than other youth, more likely to be arrested, harassed and assaulted for normal adolescent behavior, and more likely to be perceived as culpable and deserving of punishment or even death.\n\nConsider the police encounter with Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police on November 22, 2014, after a witness called 911, reporting \"a guy with a pistol\" that was \"probably fake.\" When police officers arrived, they described a much \"older\" person, weighing 170 pounds, standing 5 feet 7 inches tall and wearing size 36 pants and a man's extra-large jacket. The officers were doing what empirical research on implicit racial bias suggests that police do: routinely overestimate the age and the perceived threat of young black boys.\n\nIf we expect any meaningful change in the relationship between black men and the police, we have to start early. We have to help police resist the faulty perceptions of black youth as violent and aggressive and work to develop black boys' faith in law enforcement. To aid this reform, we should revisit our extensive reliance on police in schools, mandate officer training on adolescent development and implicit bias, and require deep shifts in police policy and procedure to facilitate new opportunities for genuine, positive interactions between black youth and the police. Without these reforms, the unfair policing of black boys - and black men - will continue.\n\nAngela J.

But Racism Sabotages Benefits For Black Men\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nVirginia Anderson\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University. Paula Burch-Celentano/Tulane University hide caption\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University.\n\nMore education typically leads to better health, yet Black men in the U.S. are not getting the same benefit as other groups, research suggests.\n\nThe reasons for the gap are vexing, experts say, but may provide an important window into unique challenges Black men face as they try to gain not only good health but also equal footing in the U.S.\n\nGenerally, higher education means better paying jobs and health insurance, healthier behaviors and longer lives. This is true across nearly all demographic groups. And studies show life expectancy is higher for Black men with a college degree or higher, compared with those who have not finished high school.\n\nBut the increase is not as big as it is for whites. This comes on top of the many health obstacles Black men already face. They are more likely to die from chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer than white men, and their average life expectancy is lower. Experts point to a variety of factors that might play a role, but many say the most pervasive is racism.\n\nResearchers note that while Black men and women face many of the same challenges, Black women generally have a longer life expectancy than Black men . (They also point out that for now it is difficult to draw conclusions about Hispanic people because of a lack of studies on these issues.) As a result, many experts say that these health problems stem from a persistent devaluation of Black men in U.S. society.\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hide caption\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it\n\n\"At every level of income and education, there is still an effect of race,\" says David Williams , a professor of public health at Harvard University who decades ago developed a scale that quantified the connection between racism and health .\n\nThe precise difference in health gains between educated white men and educated Black men is hard to pinpoint because of differences in study designs. Some studies, for example, look at life expectancy, while others look at disease burden or depression.\n\nExperts say, however, that the evidence is strong and convincing that these gaps have persisted over many years. A 2012 study published in Health Affairs , for example, found that life expectancy for white men with the most education was 12.9 years longer than for white men with the least education. For Black men, the difference between the most and least educated was 9.7 years.\n\nIn addition, other research shows how that gap plays out. A 2019 study examined the difference in years of \"lost life\" - years cut off because of health challenges - between the groups. Educated Black men lost 12.09 years of life expectancy, while educated white men lost 8.34 years, according to the study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior .\n\nRacism affects Black men's health and it is persistent, experts say.\n\n\"No matter how far you go in school, no matter what you accomplish, you're still a Black man,\" says Derek Novacek , who has a doctorate in clinical psychology from Emory University and is now at UCLA researching Black-white health disparities.\n\nS. Jay Olshansky , a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois in Chicago and lead author of the 2012 study, says possible risk factors for various diseases and environmental issues could also play a role.\n\n\"I'd be very surprised if this wasn't part of the equation,\" he says. \"The risk of diabetes and obesity is much higher among the Black population, even those that are highly educated.\"\n\nAmong other possible causes that researchers are probing are stress and depression.\n\n\"When you follow other groups with more education, depression declines,\" says Dr. Shervin Assari , who studies race, gender and health and is associate professor of medicine at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science outside Los Angeles. \"But when you look at Black men - guess what? Depression goes up .\"\n\nDepression is often an indicator of physical well-being as well as a contributing factor to many chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes.\n\nIsolated at Home and Work\n\nResearchers who study the health of various racial and ethnic groups, as well as the social factors that influence health outcomes, see cause for concern. The findings suggest that the power of discrimination to harm Black men's lives may be more persistent than previously understood. And they could mean that improving Black men's health may be more complicated than previously believed.\n\n\"What has surprised me is how powerfully and consistently discrimination predicts poor health,\" says Williams.\n\nCOVID-19 has underscored the issue. As early as last April researchers noticed higher death and hospitalization rates for Black people. The patterns have continued: Black patients are nearly two times as likely as whites to die of the virus, while Black men have the highest rates of COVID deaths .\n\nThe COVID outcomes, Williams and others suggest in interviews, helped point out that the health and well-being of middle-class, educated Black men may have been overlooked.\n\nHigher education hasn't brought about the health equity many experts had expected. While Black men have worse health than other groups if they are not educated, the data show they don't catch up to their white peers even when they are.\n\n\"What society has done to Black men is to corner them,\" Assari says.\n\nBlack men, even with an education, have less of a financial and social safety net than white men and that brings added stress, experts say. Also, as Black men climb corporate, academic or managerial ladders, many feel isolated. And social isolation is linked to poor health.\n\nThomas LaVeist , a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University, says that in a white-dominated society, Black men are less likely to have accumulated social capital - for example, family members with high incomes or social and business connections - who can open doors for them.\n\nAnd once hired into the workplace, they are less likely to have mentors, LaVeist says, and that lack of connections is associated with stress, depression and other factors that can lead to poorer health.\n\n\"There needs to be a designated effort to provide an on-ramp\" for Black men, he says.\n\nNo matter what stage of life, or level of achievement, most have experienced an excess of cumulative adversity and continued racism.\n\n\"Your high socioeconomic status doesn't protect you from the impact or from the incidence\" of racism, says Dr. Adrian Tyndall , associate vice president for strategic and academic affairs at University of Florida Health.\n\n\"That is difficult,\" adds Tyndall, who is Black. \"If I were to walk out of this institution and into the community, where people don't know me, I could be called the N-word. And yeah, that's pretty depressing.\"\n\nThe Need to Prove Yourself\n\nThe cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically - but so does the anticipation of it.\n\n\"It's not just the actual exposure in dealing with these kinds of experiences, but it's 'What do you do before leaving home?' You're careful about your dress, your behavior, the way you look because of the threat of discrimination, and so you react,\" says Williams, the Harvard professor.\n\nFor example, when Williams, who is Black, first became a professor at Yale University, he wore a coat and tie every day. No one else in his department did that. And yet, he says, he kept up the practice for years.\n\nLaVeist remembers getting onto an elevator at an academic medical center around 1990, shortly after earning his Ph.D., and a passenger wearing a white coat - presumably a doctor - asked LaVeist, who was dressed in a suit, to clean up a spill on the sixth floor.\n\n\"When I told him that I was a professor, he didn't speak,\" says LaVeist. \"He simply didn't speak.\"\n\nGreg Pennington has a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of North Carolina and an undergraduate degree from Harvard, owns a professional consulting firm in Atlanta, and has worked with hundreds of men individually as well as dozens of Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\"It's not so much that [Black men] experience discrimination and depression 'even after' they have advanced degrees,\" he says. \"It's more descriptive to say 'throughout the whole process.'\"\n\nDespite their academic credentials, Black men say, they often feel they need to prove themselves, which adds another layer of stress.\n\n\"It's almost like I can't fail; I'm representative of other Black males,\" says Woodrow W.

To understand why COVID-19 killed so many young Black men, you need to know the legend of John Henry.\n\nby Akilah Johnson and Nina Martin\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Kejuane Artez Bates was a big man with big responsibilities. The arrival of the novel coronavirus in Vidalia, Louisiana, was another burden on a body already breaking under the load. Bates was in his 10th year with the Vidalia Police Department , assigned as a resource officer to the upper elementary school. But with classrooms indefinitely closed, he was back on patrol duty and, like most people in those early days of the pandemic, unprotected by a mask. On Friday, March 20, he was coughing and his nose was bleeding. The next day, he couldn't get out of bed.\n\nBates was only 36, too young to be at risk for COVID-19, or so the conventional wisdom went. He attributed his malaise to allergies and pushed forward with his second full-time job, as head pastor of Forest Aid Baptist Church , working on his Sunday sermon between naps. Online church was a new concept to his parishioners, and during the next morning's service, he had to keep reminding them to mute their phones. As he preached about Daniel in the lion's den - we will be tested, but if we continue to have faith, we will come through - he grimaced from the effort. That night he was burning up with fever. Five days later he was on a ventilator; five days after that, he died.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has killed 1 out of every 800 African Americans , a toll that overwhelms the imagination, even more stunning is the deadly efficiency with which it has targeted young Black men like Bates. One study using data through July found that Black people ages 35 to 44 were dying at nine times the rate of white people the same age, though the gap slightly narrowed later in the year. And in an analysis for ProPublica this summer using the only reliable data at the time accounting for age, race and gender, from Michigan and Georgia, Harvard researcher Tamara Rushovich found that the disparity was greatest in Black men. It was a phenomenon Enrique Neblett Jr. noticed when he kept seeing online memorials for men his age. \"I'll be 45 this year,\" said the University of Michigan professor, who studies racism and health. \"I wasn't seeing 60- and 70-year-old men. We absolutely need to be asking what is going on here?\"\n\nTo help illuminate this gap in knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of why America has lost so many young Black men to COVID-19, ProPublica spent months gathering their stories, starting with hundreds of news articles, obituaries and medical examiners' reports, then interviewing the relatives and friends of nearly two dozen men, along with researchers who specialize in Black men's health. Our efforts led us to a little-known body of research that takes its name from one of the most enduring symbols of Black American resilience.\n\nAs the legend goes, John Henry was a steel-driving man who defeated a steam-powered drill and died with a hammer in his hand. The folktale celebrates one man's victory against seemingly insurmountable odds. But it holds another, harsher truth: His determination and strength are also what killed him. The John Henry of contemporary social theory is a man striving to get ahead in an unequal society. The effort of confronting that machine, day in and day out, compounded over a lifetime, leads to stress so corrosive that it physically changes bodies, causing Black men to age quicker, become sicker and die younger than nearly any other U.S. demographic group. COVID-19 is a new gear in an old machine.\n\nIn interviews about the young men who died from the virus, a portrait emerged of a modern John Henry: hard-working, ambitious, optimistic and persistent, trying to lift others along with themselves. They were the very people communities would have turned to first to help recover from the pandemic: entrepreneurs who were also employers; confidants like coaches, pastors and barbers; family men forced into a sandwich generation younger than their white counterparts, because their parents got sick earlier and they had to care for them while raising kids of their own.\n\nThey were ordinary men. Time and again, it was their fight that was remarkable.\n\nBates, the only child of a single mother who supported him as a teacher's aide, made it to Alcorn State University on football and choir scholarships. When his mother got sick with breast cancer, he had to drop out; after she died, he was almost destitute. Over the years, he built himself into multiple men at once, each a pillar to many others: the pastor whose flock depended on his counsel; the mentor known to school kids as Uncle Officer Bates; the assistant football coach and band director ; the adoring father to 5-year-old Madison - his \"heartbeat,\" he called her. Recently he and his wife, Chelsea, a second grade teacher, had launched One Love Travel, organizing excursion packages and cruises as part of their long-term plan to build generational wealth.\n\nHe carried the stress of his efforts in his blood vessels, in his kidneys, in the extra pounds that accumulated with each passing year; he had diabetes and hypertension and at 6-foot-6, he was more than 100 pounds overweight. His official cause of death, on April 1, was COVID-19-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nBut Chelsea knows that the virus, no matter how powerful, didn't kill her husband on its own. It was the years of working nonstop, taking care of other people more than himself, that wore his body down. And when the virus attacked, he couldn't fight back.\n\nIn the summer of 1978, the social epidemiologist Sherman James , then a 34-year-old researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, met the man who would shape his life's work. At 70, John Martin was a retired farmer who suffered from debilitating osteoarthritis and hypertension. He had peptic ulcers so severe that doctors had to remove 40% of his stomach. Recounting his story in his backyard rocking chair, his cane resting on his lap, the old man had no doubt why his health was so bad: \"I worked too hard.\"\n\nBorn in 1907, Martin grew up in a family of sharecroppers who were only paid half of what their labor in the tobacco fields earned. Throughout the South at the time, most Black farmers lived at the economic mercy of landowners who were employers, landlords and vendors all at once. Martin watched as the system ruthlessly exploited his father; after one particularly harsh winter spent hungry, Martin vowed he would be different. Borrowing $3,725 in 1941, he purchased 75 acres. He had 40 years to settle the mortgage but accomplished the near-impossible: He paid it off in five. \"That's the reason my legs [are] all out of whack today,\" he told James.\n\nJames listened, spellbound, until Martin's wife called out, \"John Henry, it's time for lunch.\" At that moment, something clicked. Holy cow, James remembers thinking. \"It was just like the ancestors were speaking to me.\" The power of Martin's story wasn't simply that it echoed the legend of John Henry; it also echoed the life experiences of most of the working-class African American men James knew.\n\nFive years out of graduate school, James was among a small group of researchers focusing on one of the most enduring public health problems in the United States: why health outcomes for Black men are so poor. Black men live shorter lives than all other Americans - 71.5 years versus 76.1 years for white men - and have for generations. Black men's life expectancy didn't reach 65, the eligibility age for Medicare, until 1995, 30 years after the federal health program for the elderly became law; white men were living into their mid-60s by 1950. The shorter lifespans reflect a broader disparity: Black people have much higher rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and strokes than white people do, and they develop those chronic conditions up to 10 years earlier. The gap persisted this year when the Brookings Institution examined COVID-19 deaths by race; in each age category, Black people were dying at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older.\n\nFor generations, public health experts mostly ignored the disparities. When they did pay attention, they invariably blamed the victims - their \"unhealthy\" behaviors and diets, their genes, the under-resourced neighborhoods they \"chose\" to live in and the low-paying jobs they \"chose\" to work. Their chronic illnesses were seen as failures of personal responsibility. Their shorter life expectancy was written off to addiction and the myth of \"black-on-black\" violence . Many of those arguments were legacies of the slave and Jim Crow eras, when the white medical and science establishment promoted the idea of innate Black inferiority and criminality to rationalize systems built on servitude and segregation.\n\nPondering the lessons of John Henry Martin , James began to see what many of his colleagues had been missing. It wasn't just living in poverty that wore down Black men's bodies, he hypothesized, but the struggle to break out of poverty. It wasn't just inequality that made them sick, but the effort to be equal in a system that was fundamentally unjust. \"It's this striving to make something of themselves ... to live their lives with dignity and purpose and to be successful against extraordinary circumstances,\" James said. \"They're trying to make a way out of no way. It's the Black American story.\"\n\nAmerica has changed profoundly since Martin's day. Yet the machinery of racial inequality continues to be omnipresent. It's in the hospitals where Black newborns have significantly lower mortality if they're cared for by Black doctors rather than white ones. In the redlined neighborhoods where poverty and pollution are concentrated - but not affordable housing or grocery stores or reliable internet. It's in the crumbling, exploitative economies that force parents to risk their lives working long hours for low pay without sick leave. In mass incarceration and voter suppression. In the innumerable hurdles, one piled upon another, that make Black Americans' climb up the socioeconomic ladder more daunting than ever, their successes more fragile and their setbacks more consequential.\n\n\"Everyone thinks about racism as something that is personally mediated, like someone insulting me,\" said Linda Sprague Martinez , a professor at Boston University's School of Social Work who conducts community health research with adolescents and young adults. \"But the way in which it's really pervasive is how it disrupts life chances and opportunity. ... These are systems that are designed for you to fail, essentially, and for you to be erased and to be maintained in a certain position in our society.\"\n\nChallenging such a relentless machine, through \"high-effort coping,\" James concluded, requires three categories of personal traits that are major themes of the John Henry legend: tenacity, mental and physical vigor and a commitment to hard work. To measure them, he developed the John Henryism scale, with scores determined by how strongly people identify with 12 statements, including: \"Once I make up my mind to do something, I stay with it until the job is completely done,\" and, \"It's not always easy, but I usually find a way to do what really needs to be done.\"\n\nTo score high in John Henryism, you don't have to be Black or male or economically disadvantaged. But over the years, James and other researchers have found that Black people, especially those who are poor and working-class, do score high and tend to suffer greater cardiovascular risks, perhaps because the innumerable hurdles in their paths require greater effort to overcome. \"The stress,\" James said, \"is going to be far more overwhelming than it has a human right to be.\"\n\nStress is a physiological reaction, hard-wired in the body, that helps protect it against external threats. At the first sign of danger, the brain sounds an alarm, setting off a torrent of neurological and hormonal signals that whoosh into the blood, stimulating the body to fight or give flight. The heart beats faster and breathing quickens; blood vessels dilate, so more oxygen reaches the brain and muscles. The immune system's inflammatory response is activated to promote quick healing. When the threat passes, hormone levels return to normal, blood glucose ebbs and heart rate and blood pressure go back to baseline. At least, that's how the human body is designed to work.\n\nBut overexposure to cortisol and other stress hormones can cause the gears to malfunction. \"Your body's over-producing, always working hard to bring itself back down to the normal level,\" said Roland J. Thorpe Jr ., a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and founding director of the Program for Research on Men's Health at the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. The constant strain \"resets the normal,\" he said. As blood pressure remains high and inflammation becomes chronic, the inner linings of blood vessels start to thicken and stiffen, which forces the heart to work harder, which dysregulates other organs until they, too, begin to fail. \"Your body starts to wear down,\" Thorpe said - a phenomenon known as weathering.\n\nThe cumulative effects of stress begin in the womb, when cortisol released into a pregnant woman's bloodstream crosses the placenta; it is one of the reasons a disproportionate number of Black babies are born too early and too small. Then, exposure to adverse childhood experiences - anything from abuse and neglect to poverty and hunger - continues the toxic stream; too much exposure to cortisol at a critical stage in development can rewire the neurological system's fight-or-flight response, essentially causing the brain's stress switch to break. The more stress a youngster endures, the more likely he or she is to have academic, behavioral and health problems from depression to obesity.\n\nWeathering isn't specific to race, but it is believed to take a particular toll on Black people because of the unique, unrelenting stress caused by racism that wears away the body and the spirit, \"just like you have siding on the house, and the rain or the sun beats on it, and eventually it starts to fade,\" said Dr. Jerome Adams , the U.S. surgeon general under the Trump administration. Shawnita Sealy-Jefferson , a social epidemiologist at Ohio State University, says the human body isn't designed to withstand such biological and emotional assaults: \"It's the same thing as if you revved the engine of your car all day, every day. Sooner or later, the car is going to break down.\"\n\nThe effects of stress can be seen at the cellular level. Researchers have found that in Black people, telomeres - repeated sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes by forming a cap, much like the plastic tip on a shoelace - become shortened at a faster rate , a sign of premature aging. In a 2018 study examining changes in seven biomarkers in cardiac patients over a 30-year period, researchers found that Black patients weathered at an average of about six years faster than whites. And it was the extraordinarily high rates of hypertension in the Black community that prompted scientists to look at the impact of stress in the first place. By age 55, about 76% of Black men and women develop high blood pressure, versus 54% of white men and 40% of white women, which increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSustained stress has strong links to obesity, which Black children and adults have at much higher rates than whites. Some of this is physiological: The interplay between cortisol and glucose is complex and insidious, triggering metabolic changes that can lead to diabetes and other chronic diseases. Some of it is psychological and behavioral: Stress is strongly associated with depression and other mental health disorders. \"The way that people deal with stress is by strategies that make us feel better,\" such as comfort eating, said Thomas LaVeist , dean of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. Stress and anxiety cause sleeplessness, which itself is correlated with weight gain. The result is often a cascade of health problems - hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome - that strike early and feed off of each other.\n\nBecause Black Americans experience many forms of stress, often at once, researchers have more questions than answers about the specific role John Henryism plays in these outcomes. The study of Black men's health remains an under-examined frontier, with little in the way of funding or will because \"Black men are not viewed as sympathetic,\" said LaVeist, and because so few go into the health research professions. He and Thorpe, the Johns Hopkins professor, co-founded the Black Men's Health Project , the first large-scale national study focused solely on Black men's needs, with a goal sample size of 5,000. They hope to learn how stressors like segregation and adverse early life experiences impact health outcomes.\n\nIf this segregated body of emerging knowledge were to grow and infiltrate the mainstream medical and research communities, James can only imagine how beneficial that would be. Health professionals could build deeper relationships with their patients by better understanding the sources of stress that wreak havoc on their cardiovascular systems. They could test for high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol levels more frequently and at younger ages. \"Until we can have a society that is more just racially,\" James said, \"we do need to find these intermediate steps.\"\n\nAs ProPublica examined the lives lost to COVID-19, themes emerged in the pressure points faced by many young Black men. The wearing down typically begins when they are boys and must become little John Henrys to navigate white spaces or push through the adverse experiences endemic to Black communities. It continues when they grow into men, as most need to navigate the public's projections of danger with unwavering vigilance. The more they succeed, the more responsibility they feel to lift their families and communities with them, and with that, comes more stress.\n\nAs James listened to the stories ProPublica was gathering, he instantly recognized the cycle of striving and succumbing that he has been writing about for 40 years. \"They could have done so much more had the struggle not been so intense,\" James said. \"They were cut down too soon.\"\n\nThomas Fields Jr. was barely a year old when his father first went to prison. The loss altered the trajectory of his life in ways that many children wouldn't have been able to overcome. His mother, just 17 when he was born, moved with him from the suburbs of Washington, D.C., to Detroit, where her own mother had recently relocated. The city was in freefall: manufacturing jobs were disappearing; crime was surging; middle-class and white flight was stripping away the city's tax base, eroding vital services and causing schools to fail. Just waiting at the wrong bus stop could get you robbed or shot.\n\n\"When you're a young male living in Detroit, if you live past 18, it's like you're 50 years old,\" Fields, then 31, said on a Facebook Live chat last year. \"I swear that's how it feels.\"\n\nMitigating childhood adversity requires deep wells of resilience; researchers say one of the best ways to build those reserves is having a nurturing caregiver. In this, young Thomas was exceptionally lucky. His mother worked two jobs and still managed to watch him like a hawk; she told him constantly that she loved him. His grandmothers looked after him after school and during summer breaks. His father, Thomas Sr., did his best to be involved from behind bars, urging him to not make the same mistakes. \"I wanted this Thomas Fields to break the mold,\" he said.\n\nTo do that, Thomas became a little John Henry. He got decent grades, stayed out of trouble and taught himself to cook - healthy food, not the junk so many of his peers ate. After high school, he attended Grambling State University in Louisiana for a couple of years, then joined the U.S. Navy, where he went from being a talented amateur chef to a trained professional. He also became a father. When there were setbacks, he was already planning his next move. It's a strategy that Black adolescents absorb like the air they breathe and the water they drink, Sprague Martinez said. \"The mentality is: 'Even if this system is not designed to work for me ... I'm going to win this game. I haven't gotten the prize yet? I must not be working hard enough.'\"\n\nHigh-effort coping can confer mental health benefits even for children raised in the direst of circumstances. Dosha DJay Joi endured the kind of trauma that dooms many children - beatings, neglect, sexual abuse. Born in Chicago, he spent much of his adolescence in group homes in the Wisconsin system. For years he was afraid to talk about the abuse and scared to tell his birth mother he was queer. He learned to channel himself into education and advocacy, helping other LGBTQ and foster kids; he especially wanted to make sure children remained connected with their siblings. He was inspired to study social work because of what he'd been through, said his mother, Kecha Kitchens. \"Then a family member got sick, and he didn't like how the nurses were treating the other patients in the nursing home, so he wanted to become a nurse.\"\n\nBy the age of 28, Joi had a bachelor's degree in human services, he had trained as a substance abuse counselor and he was working toward his nursing degree. He served as a court-appointed special advocate for kids aging out of foster care and lobbied lawmakers in the Wisconsin capitol and Washington D.C., forming a special bond with Rep. Gwen Moore , who represents Milwaukee in Congress. But the years of hardship took an enormous physical toll; Joi suffered from hypertension, heart and lung problems and at his heaviest, he weighed more than 500 pounds. When COVID-19 arrived in the Midwest, he was particularly vulnerable. He died on May 14.\n\nFor young John Henrys, the psychological benefits of high-effort coping seem to be complicated by what's happening inside the body. \"Typically when you study resilience in any group, and [subjects are] doing well by our typical metrics\" - going to college, getting a good job, not taking drugs - \"we say, 'Woo-hoo,'\" University of Georgia researcher Gene Brody said. \"Logically, we thought this would transfer to have health benefits.\" But for Black young adults trying to climb the economic ladder, they found just the opposite. \"When you look under the skin, doing blood draws and using other kinds of measures, they look like their health is starting to suffer.\"\n\nIn more than 25 years spent tracking the health of Black families in rural Georgia , Brody and his colleagues found that adolescents identified by their teachers as being success-oriented already had higher \"allostatic loads\" - science jargon for wear-and-tear on the body - at age 19 than their peers. By age 25, those from more disadvantaged backgrounds who scored high on the John Henryism scale were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that are precursors to diabetes and heart disease, than people from less disadvantaged backgrounds. Brody and his colleagues have dubbed this phenomenon \"skin-deep resilience.\" The same effects are not found for young white strivers.\n\nIn his late 20s, Fields was diagnosed with such a severe case of diabetes that his military career came to a screeching halt. When he returned to Detroit last year, he was a little brawnier, with more tattoos. \"Diabetes was something that he was going to beat, because he wasn't going to lose to anything,\" said the Rev. Torion Bridges, one of his best friends for 20 years. He became a personal chef and motivational speaker, started a podcast and wrote a cookbook. He helped out his mom, who had multiple sclerosis. And he took a job as a \"school culture facilitator,\" working with kids who had discipline problems, at Paul Robeson Malcolm X Academy, the pioneering Afrocentric public school he had attended. He was especially good with troubled boys who didn't have a father at home, said principal Jeffrey Robinson, his onetime homeroom teacher, later his boss. \"He could identify with the feeling of the loss.\"\n\nIn March, Fields and his mother caught the coronavirus at the same time.\n\nShe recovered. He did not.\n\nTo navigate life as a Black man is to be constantly vigilant. The ubiquity of racism means that everyday interactions, while driving or shopping or birdwatching , can have potentially dangerous outcomes. So John Henrys live in a heightened state of awareness, continually adjusting. It might mean placing family photos near the front door to quickly prove your son belongs should police ever respond. It often means being able to \"strategically assimilate\" - to assume a public identity aimed at neutralizing stereotypes of blackness and defusing irrational white fears. This, W.E.B. DuBois explained more than a century ago, is \"double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"\n\nNew York Times columnist Brent Staples would whistle Vivaldi in graduate school to signal that he was too cultured to be threatening. Darrell Hudson , who researches health disparities at Washington University in St. Louis, scans the closet each day before teaching class to select what he calls his \"Non- Threatening Black Guy Uniform.\"\n\n\"What's not appreciated fully, I think, is how much energy it takes,\" said Derek M. Griffith , professor and director of the Center for Research on Men's Health at Vanderbilt University. \"All of these different things that you have to do to modulate your body and so forth, all that additional attention that you have to pay to that, is a burden that most people don't have to bear. It is a cause of weathering that we don't fully appreciate.\"\n\nA 2014 study found that vigilance was positively associated with the prevalence of hypertension for Blacks but not whites. The more vigilant Black people were, the more the disparity grew. And researchers have found that Black people who are on guard against anticipated discrimination have higher blood pressures while they sleep. \"When you experience racism or discrimination and it could cost your life, it's good to be vigilant; but a prolonged and heightened state of vigilance is not good,\" the University of Michigan's Neblett said. \"It can kill you in the end.\"\n\nLeslie Lamar Parker grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs, in a state that was 84% white. Like many John Henrys in this story, he was large - tall and wide - in a way that made him stand out to cruel classmates and clueless teachers. Bigness can be perilous for Black boys, who are often seen as older, stronger and less innocent than their white counterparts, stereotypes that underlie higher rates of school discipline and police violence. Parker learned to play the class clown and questioned authority. \"School couldn't hold his attention, not because he wasn't smart. He wouldn't go,\" his mother, Tyuon Brazell, said. Because he wasn't on track to graduate, she did what other parents might not and suggested he drop out his junior year. That's when he started to thrive, earning his GED, graduating from college and becoming an IT specialist in his old school district, where he mentored students of color, ordering them lunch from DoorDash and supervising the tech club. \"That was really important to him,\" said his wife, Whitney, \"making sure they didn't fail any other brown kids like they failed him.\"\n\nOne key to his coping was overcorrecting for how he might be perceived. Strangers would approach him to say how lovely it was to see him with his son and daughter, a microaggression masquerading as a compliment. He was so sensitive to stereotypes about absent Black fathers, his wife said, he was \"a present parent on steroids.\" To walk through the world as a Black man is to be simultaneously hypervisible and invisible, under surveillance yet never really seen. So he turned his wardrobe into a \"conversation starter,\" an expression of his irreverent personality but also armor against snap judgments about his imposingness. He carried a Spongebob SquarePants backpack to work and often wore a pro-wrestling or superhero T-shirt during off hours.\n\nParker was constantly scanning the horizon for threats against his family and his kids at school, wondering whether there was something more that he could do for them. He projected a cool demeanor, his argumentative wit camouflaging worries that his mother knew kept his head in overdrive. \"I kept telling him: 'Son, you need to rest. You don't have to do everything in a day.'\" He was diagnosed with high blood pressure at just 27 and worried it, and the extra pounds, would keep him from seeing his two children grow up. He died in May from COVID-19 at the age of 31.\n\nThe effort it takes for Black people to navigate mostly white spaces - to get an education, earn a living, take out a loan, raise a child - can be caustic. Their credentials are questioned; expertise doubted . On college campuses , Black students are often asked if they're on a sports scholarship or if they're really students. Research shows that a person doesn't need to be the target of a racist incident for his body to be affected. Watching videos of police killing Black people or even just anticipating a racist experience can trigger the fight-or-flight response. Incidents build up in memories and transform into chronic stressors; ruminating on them can activate the body's biological stress reaction. This happens over and over again, often many times a day, until the cortisol pump essentially breaks.\n\nJoshua Bush, who died in April of COVID-19, slammed up against racial stereotypes in his work as a nurse in South Carolina. There were funny looks from people who didn't expect to see a Black man when he arrived at job interviews and white patients who refused to let him touch them. He told them, \"That is your choice, but you're missing out on great help,\" his mother, Linda, recalled. He and his wife, LaKita, saw the health care industry as their route to upward mobility. She worked in hospital administration; at 30, he was studying to become a registered nurse, working as an LPN.\n\nBush also suffered from a rare enzyme abnormality that caused severe muscle cramps from overexertion, and because of it, trips to the emergency room weren't uncommon. He'd come to accept that the first image doctors and nurses saw - someone Black and overweight - influenced their bedside manner. They treated him like he had no medical knowledge and lectured him about diabetes, though it had nothing to do with why he was seeking care. His experience informed the way he cared for his own patients, part of his \"fight against the system,\" his wife said. At the same time, she could see her husband's stress \"all over his body.\"\n\nLifting as we climb, onward and upward we go. Words that started as a call-to-action at the rise of the Jim Crow South have become an enduring part of the African American experience - and can serve as a unique form of stress. The proverb was born of Black suffragist Mary Eliza Church Terrell's belief that it was incumbent upon the growing Black middle and upper class to use their position to fight racial discrimination and help others rise through education, work and community activism. It is why Thomas Fields was told as a boy that he was \"duty-bound\" to give back to the community once he got an education. Why Dosha Joi advocated for young people in the system \"because someone helped bring out the sunshine in me.\"\n\n\"You're socialized to say it's not just about you. It's really about what you're going to do for your broader community and for your family,\" Washington University's Hudson explained. \"People take it very seriously, trying to light a path for those behind them - even when they're not necessarily in the most stable situation themselves. ... But they're lifting as they climb. That's taxing. That's a visceral stress.\"\n\nIn the Brookhaven, Mississippi, of Eugene Thompson's youth, Black business owners understood that Brookway Boulevard - at least the stretch that ran through downtown - was for white businesses. The election of Barack Obama was a turning point; Thompson figured if a Black man could become president of the United States, surely he could rent a modest space on \"the Boulevard.\" Publicly, his goal was to grow his client base by cutting white people's hair, too. His family knew his aspirations were grander. \"He wanted to do something in Brookhaven to help Black people to get off their knees,\" his mother, Odell Edwards, said. \"We are on our knees.\"\n\nIt's not easy earning a living in Mississippi, where the single most common job is working as a cashier and the $7.25 minimum wage hasn't budged in a decade. Cutting hair came naturally for Thompson, who started on himself at 12. He attended a local beauty academy before he could afford to go to barber school and over the years took the same methodical approach to growing his business - buying secondhand equipment, doing the construction himself, all without bank loans, mentoring or government support.\n\nBut Thompson's real ambition was to start his own school. \"He always tried to encourage the boys in the community, or people who had been in prison and couldn't find a job - 'I can teach you how to cut hair and you can have your own business,'\" his younger sister, Dedra Edwards, said. After three years spent earning his teaching credential, Thompson opened his TaperNation Barber Academy for students last fall. Then he realized graduates needed places to work, so he launched his next project: renovating a second shop nearby where other barbers and hair stylists could rent chairs.\n\n\"It was running him ragged,\" Odell said.\n\nAt 46, Thompson was severely overweight and suffered from lifelong respiratory problems as well as anxiety and sleeplessness. High blood pressure and diabetes ran in his family, but Thompson's true health status was unclear - like more than 15% of Black people in Mississippi, he wasn't insured and avoided going to the doctor except in an emergency. When he started feeling symptoms of COVID-19 in late March, he shrugged them off at first; he'd been having heart palpitations and panic attacks, which his family attributed to stress from work.\n\nAfter he died in early April, leaving behind six children, TaperNation had to shut down. \"You have to have a barber's instructor license to keep it going, and no one else in the family has one,\" his sister said. \"We had to sell almost everything.\"\n\nRecent disasters - Hurricane Katrina, the Great Recession - have shown that Black communities aren't just more vulnerable than white populations to economic and social dislocations; they recover more slowly. The impacts of the pandemic are likely to be magnified because so many deaths have occurred among Black people under age 60, the peak earning years when people raise families, start businesses, amass social capital and create lasting legacies. In addition to the lives it took, COVID-19 has robbed wealth that John Henrys were only beginning to accrue and toppled what they had begun to build for themselves and those around them.\n\nIn many cases, they were the structural beams, holding everything up. \"These are people who help pay bills for people who aren't their biological family members,\" said Sealy-Jefferson, the Ohio State social epidemiologist. \"They bring food when somebody dies. They watch kids when a single mother has to work.\" Some of the biggest losses are intangible, she said: \"social support, emotional support, resource sharing, encouragement, storytelling, role modeling- all of these things that are vital for African Americans in particular, given our history in this country.\"\n\nFields couldn't comfort students reeling from a crisis that has killed more than 1,600 of their loved ones and neighbors. \"It's a tremendous loss,\" said Robinson, his principal. Bates' wife, Chelsea, was too bereaved to go back to work when school resumed, which meant living off of her husband's death benefits and savings; she focused on trying to help Madison process a grief she's too young to understand. \"Sometimes she lays on the floor and kicks and screams that she wants her daddy, that she misses daddy and why did he have to leave?\" she said. \"I tell her, I'm sorry, I wish that mama could do something to bring him back. I really do.\"\n\nWeekday mornings have been quiet without Kendall Pierre Sr. puttering around the house before sunrise so he could open his barbershop by 5 a.m. That's when workers from nearby chemical plants would stop in for a cut or shave after their graveyard shifts. Sundays are different without his sermons at Mt. Zion Baptist Church, in the little town of Ama, Louisiana, followed by a family breakfast his son always looked forward to. \"My grandmother would come. Some of my aunties and cousins. He would put Aunt Jemima batter in the waffle iron and say: 'See? This is better than Waffle House!'\"\n\nSince his dad died in May of COVID-19, Kendall Pierre Jr., a 20-year-old student at Louisiana State University, has felt an overwhelming absence and, at the same time, his father's equally consuming presence. \"I can still hear him,\" he said.\n\nDon't drive with your hoodie on.\n\nWork twice as hard.\n\nReal men don't wear slippers in public; put on some shoes.\n\nThe only child of a single mother, 45-year-old Pierre Sr. took his role as father figure seriously. To nieces and nephews, he was Uncle Dad. To his sons' basketball teams, he was Coach Kendall with the pep talks.\n\nIf a task has begun, never leave it until it's done.\n\nBe the labor great or small, do it well or not at all.\n\nWhen players couldn't afford uniforms or travel for tournaments, he would pay. \"Their parents would send them with all they could, which was sometimes only $5,\" Pierre Jr. said. They could count on him for food, deodorant, even a haircut. \"He would bring his clippers to make sure all the players looked nice.\"\n\nWhen the killing of George Floyd roiled the country, Pierre Jr. had no doubt about how his father would have reacted. He would have talked to officials at the sheriff's office, school board administrators, government leaders. He would have organized community meetings at the church.\n\nHe needed dialysis to stay alive. He couldn't miss a session, not even during a pandemic.\n\nWe're living in troubled times.\n\nHis son thought about that when his friend texted him about organizing a Black Lives Matter protest. \"Since my dad passed, I've had this newfound courage, and this urge to act on things ... to just do things outside of my comfort zone,\" he said.\n\nOn a Saturday morning in June, 400 people joined in the 2.6-mile march from Westbank Bridge Park to St. Charles Parish Courthouse. A local reporter covered it and interviewed Pierre Jr. for a story. \"If we don't speak about systemic racism and police brutality, no change will ever happen,\" he said. \"I feel like it's something that I have to do and be a part of something bigger than just me.\"\n\nHe knows his father would have been proud. His mother was. But she worries, too. Her husband didn't make enough time for doctor's appointments to monitor his Type 2 diabetes, nor did he get much sleep. \"I would tell him, 'Kendall, you need to rest,'\" recalled Sabrina, his wife of 24 years and a registered nurse. \"He would say he could rest when he's dead and gone.\"\n\nShe knows how much goes into taking care of yourself as a Black man and thinks about that every time her sons walk out the door; her daughter, too. \"Lord, I pray for them. ... I tell them: 'Put the seat belt on, drive the speed limit. Make sure you don't get any tickets.' I don't want them to get stopped by a cop.\" Her husband's stature in the community conferred a kind of protection. \"Because of my husband and who he was, people would be looking out for my sons. We don't have that anymore.\"\n\nZipporah Osei and Mollie Simon contributed reporting.\n\nArt Direction by Lisa Larson-Walker.\n\nAbout the Art\n\nElliott Jamal Robbins, 32, is an artist who works in a variety of media, including drawing, printmaking, sculpture and video/animation. He has exhibited artworks in group and solo exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Miami, Berlin and the Netherlands. This is how he described his thinking behind the art in this story:\n\nFor me, the story of John Henry presents problems. Namely, its focus on the physical attributes of the man and celebrating the labor that killed him. In the original tale, John Henry is almost Christlike in his willingness, if not gleeful, in sacrificing his own body. In my own work, I'm always more drawn to the mundane scene. Rather than consider the figure of John Henry as a type or didactic prop to expound the ills of systemic racism, I decided to focus a narrative as though from the point of view of the subject, and we witness his day-to-day experiences as he does.\n\nBeginning on the bus, we are reminded of this as the site where African Americans fought for the basic human right to sit where they chose. From one mode of transportation to another, the horseback rider recalls the notion of the American west, which most often represents a connection to the land, and freedom. In contrasting the horse from the rider, we see that while one figure experiences a kind of liberation, another body is at work which propels this motion. This relationship between horse and rider is a corollary for the relationship between John Henry and the train, a mechanical achievement that would bring with it the promises of cross country travel, commerce and economic prosperity.\n\nThe story of John Henry is a means of making visible the unseen labor, exploitation and oppression of nation building. In this way I want to consider the real impact of systemic racism on those experiencing it daily, as well as decentralize the notion of racial violence from images of murdered black men and women. Instead, I want to consider how violence is enacted everyday, and its key actors are those who participate in systems which are propped up by the degradation of others.\n\nClarification, Dec. 24, 2020: This story was updated to clarify a figure on Black infant mortality.\n\nAkilah Johnson\n\nAkilah Johnson was a narrative health care reporter at ProPublica.\n\nNina Martin\n\nNina Martin was a reporter covering sex and gender issues.

The theory, known as John Henryism, helps explain racial health disparities.\n\nby Joseph Singer , Nadia Sussman , Nina Martin and Akilah Johnson\n\nCOVID-19 has killed many young Black men with deadly efficiency. When ProPublica reporters began collecting their stories and speaking to health experts to understand why, their efforts led them to a little-known body of research that takes its name from one of the most enduring symbols of Black American resilience.\n\nSherman James is a social epidemiologist who has spent the past four decades exploring why Black men have higher rates of diseases that lead to shorter lifespans than all other Americans .\n\nHis conclusion is that the constant stress of striving to succeed in the face of social inequality and structural racism can cause lasting physical damage.\n\n\"The stress is enormous. And people, people don't give up,\" James said.\n\n\"That persistence, working twice as hard, over time can really impair multiple physiological systems.\"\n\nThey were pillars of their communities and families, and they are not replaceable. To understand why COVID-19 killed so many young Black men, you need to know the legend of John Henry.\n\nAs the legend goes, John Henry was a steel-driving man who defeated a steam-powered drill and died with a hammer in his hand. The folktale celebrates one man's victory against seemingly insurmountable odds. But it holds another, harsher truth: his determination and strength are also what killed him.\n\nThe John Henry of contemporary social theory is a man striving to get ahead in an unequal society. The effort of confronting that machine, day in and day out, leads to stress so corrosive that it physically changes bodies, causing Black men to age quicker, become sicker and die younger than nearly any other U.S. demographic group.\n\n\"It's this striving to make something of themselves ... to live their lives with dignity and purpose and to be successful against extraordinary circumstances,\" James said.\n\nBlack people have much higher rates of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and strokes than white people do, and they develop those chronic conditions up to 10 years earlier. Studies link these health problems to stress. The unique, unrelenting strain caused by racism can alter a body's normal functioning until it starts to wear down. John Henrys, who battle with an unequal system as they try to get ahead in life, bear the consequences in their bodies. \"The stress,\" James said, \"is going to be far more overwhelming than it has a human right to be.\"\n\nThe stress-linked underlying conditions that Black people develop younger are the very ones that make people more vulnerable to the worst outcomes from the coronavirus. When the Brookings Institution examined COVID-19 deaths by race, Black people were dying at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older.\n\n\"They could have done so much more had the struggle not been so intense,\" James said. \"They were cut down too soon.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nFiled under:\n\nJoseph Singer\n\nJospeh Singer was a video editor at ProPublica.\n\nNadia Sussman\n\nNadia Sussman is a video journalist at ProPublica.\n\nNina Martin\n\nNina Martin was a reporter covering sex and gender issues.

      "text": "How Tennessee Disenfranchised 21% of Its Black Citizens\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLeola Scott recently decided to become a more active citizen. The 55-year-old resident of Dyersburg, Tennessee, was driven to action after her son was stabbed to death and nobody was charged.\n\nIn August, Scott tried to register to vote. That's when she learned she's not allowed to cast a ballot because she was convicted of nonviolent felonies nearly 20 years ago.\n\nOne in five Black Tennesseans are like Scott: barred from voting because of a prior felony conviction. Indeed, Tennessee appears to disenfranchise a far higher proportion of its Black residents - 21% - than any other state.\n\nThe figure comes from a new analysis by the nonprofit advocacy group The Sentencing Project, which found that Mississippi ranks a distant second, just under 16% of its Black voting-eligible population. Tennessee also has the highest rate of disenfranchisement among its Latino community - just over 8%.\n\nWhile states around the country have moved toward giving people convicted of felonies a chance to vote again , Tennessee has gone in the other direction. Over the past two decades, the state has made it more difficult for residents to get their right to vote back. In particular, lawmakers have added requirements that residents first pay any court costs and restitution and that they be current on child support.\n\nTennessee is now the only state in the country that requires those convicted of felonies be up to date on child support payments before they can vote again.\n\nThe state makes little data available about who has lost the right to vote and why. Residents who may qualify to vote again first have to navigate a confusing, opaque bureaucracy .\n\nScott says she paid off her court costs years ago. But when she brought a voting rights restoration form to the county clerk to affirm that she had paid, the clerk told her she still had an outstanding balance of $2,390.\n\n\"It was like the air was knocked out of me,\" she said. \"I did everything that I was supposed to do. When I got in trouble, I owned it. I paid my debt to society. I took pride in paying off all that.\"\n\nScott does not have receipts to verify her payments because she made them so long ago, she said. And there is no pathway for her to fight what she believes is a clerical error.\n\nShe is now a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the Tennessee NAACP challenging the state's voting rights restoration process. In court documents, the state denied allegations that the restoration process is inaccessible.\n\nOverall, according to The Sentencing Project, about 470,000 residents of Tennessee are barred from voting. Roughly 80% have already completed their sentence but are disenfranchised because they have a permanently disqualifying conviction - such as murder or rape - or because they owe court costs or child support or have gotten lost in the system trying to get their vote back.\n\nOver the past two years, about 2,000 Tennesseans have successfully appealed to have their voting rights restored.\n\nThose convicted after 1981 must get a Certification of Restoration of Voting Rights form signed by a probation or parole officer or another incarcerating authority for each conviction. The form then goes to a court clerk, who certifies that the person owes no court costs. Then it is returned to the local election commission, which then sends it to the State Election Commission for final approval. (Rules on voting restoration were revised multiple times, so older convictions are subject to different rules.)\n\nRepublican Cameron Sexton, speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, said people convicted of felonies should have to pay court costs and child support before voting.\n\n\"If someone's not paying or behind on their child support payment, that's an issue,\" he told ProPublica. \"That's an issue for that child, that's an issue for that family, not having the things that they agreed to in court to help them for that child.\"\n\nWhen asked about Tennessee being the only state to require that child support payments be up to date before voting rights can be restored, Sexton said, \"Maybe Tennessee is doing it correctly and the others are not.\"\n\nA 2019 report from the Tennessee Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found that the requirements for repayment have been especially burdensome to women, the poor and communities of color . The report also noted that Tennessee has increasingly levied court charges \"as a means for funding the State's courts and criminal justice system.\"\n\nGeorgia previously required payment of restitution and fines in order to restore voting rights. But in 2020, the office of Georgia's secretary of state clarified that anyone who has completed their sentence may vote , even if they owe court costs or other debts that were not incurred as part of their sentence.\n\nDisenfranchisement does not solely impact the lives of individual voters - it can have consequences for elections, too. This is particularly true for multiracial communities in Tennessee, according to Sekou Franklin, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University. He pointed to county-level races that have been decided by a few dozen votes .\n\n\"There are real votes that are lost that can shape elections,\" Franklin said.\n\nBlack Tennesseans, even those who were not enslaved, have been disenfranchised for centuries. In 1835, the new state constitution took away the right to vote from free Black men, who had been able to vote under the previous constitution. It also stipulated that anyone convicted of an \"infamous\" crime - a list that included robbery, bigamy and horse stealing - would lose their voting rights, often permanently.\n\nThe civil rights laws of the 1960s opened up voting again for Tennesseans. But soon lawmakers began adding back in provisions that disenfranchised people convicted of felonies. Legislators updated the statute every few years, adding to the list of crimes that permanently disqualify someone from voting. The result is a convoluted list of eligibility criteria for voting rights restoration that depend on what a person was convicted of and when the conviction took place.\n\nThe reality of disenfranchisement in Tennessee received some national attention recently around the case of a Memphis woman, Pamela Moses . Three years ago, she got her probation officer's signoff to vote again. The next day, the Tennessee Department of Correction asserted the officer had made an error. Prosecutors then charged Moses with lying on an election document. She was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison, but a judge later threw out the conviction .\n\nTennessee lawmakers from both parties have tried, unsuccessfully, to make it easier for residents to get their vote back.\n\nIn 2019, two Republican lawmakers sponsored a bill that would have automatically restored voting rights to people upon completion of their sentence. It was supported by a bipartisan coalition of civil rights advocates, including the libertarian group Americans for Prosperity and the Tennessee American Civil Liberties Union. But it never gained traction among legislators.\n\nIn 2021, two Democrats sponsored another bill that would have granted automatic vote restoration, but that bill also died. The sponsors said that the Republican supermajority in Tennessee's legislature simply doesn't have an appetite to take it on.\n\n\"We said we wanted to do criminal justice reform, but all we've done is really nibbled around the edges,\" state Sen. Brenda Gilmore told ProPublica, referring to a bill she co-sponsored with a fellow Democrat.\n\nDawn Harrington, the founder of Free Hearts, an organization that supports formerly incarcerated women, also advocated for the 2021 bill.\n\nRead More\n\nOn a trip to New York City in 2008, Harrington carried a gun that was licensed in Tennessee. Because New York does not recognize permits from other states, she was convicted of a gun possession charge.\n\nAfter serving a yearlong sentence on Rikers Island, she returned to Tennessee and set out to have her rights restored. Tennessee requires the incarcerating agency to sign the rights restoration form, but Harrington struggled to find someone in New York willing to sign it. After nine years, her rights were finally restored in 2020.\n\n\"I don't know if you know the show 'The Wiz,' but I literally eased on down the road,\" Harrington said about having her voting rights restored. \"I danced. I was so happy I cried. I was feeling all the emotions. You never know how much something means to you until it's taken away.\"\n\nDo you have information about people with felony convictions who are not allowed to vote?

It made perfect sense to ProPublica's Nikole Hannah-Jones.\n\nby Nikole Hannah-Jones\n\nInvestigating America's racial divide in education, housing and beyond.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with Politico Magazine .\n\nLast July 4, my family and I went to Long Island to celebrate the holiday with a friend and her family. After eating some barbecue, a group of us decided to take a walk along the ocean. The mood on the beach that day was festive. Music from a nearby party pulsed through the haze of sizzling meat. Lovers strolled hand in hand. Giggling children chased each other along the boardwalk.\n\nMost of the foot traffic was heading in one direction, but then two teenage girls came toward us, moving stiffly against the flow, both of them looking nervously to their right. \"He's got a gun,\" one of them said in a low voice.\n\nI turned my gaze to follow theirs, and was clasping my 4-year-old daughter's hand when a young man extended his arm and fired off multiple shots along the busy street running parallel to the boardwalk. Snatching my daughter up into my arms, I joined the throng of screaming revelers running away from the gunfire and toward the water.\n\nThe shots stopped as quickly as they had started. The man disappeared between some buildings. Chest heaving, hands shaking, I tried to calm my crying daughter, while my husband, friends and I all looked at one another in breathless disbelief. I turned to check on Hunter, a high school intern from Oregon who was staying with my family for a few weeks, but she was on the phone.\n\n\"Someone was just shooting on the beach,\" she said, between gulps of air, to the person on the line.\n\nUnable to imagine whom she would be calling at that moment, I asked her, somewhat indignantly, if she couldn't have waited until we got to safety before calling her mom.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I am talking to the police.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nMy friends and I locked eyes in stunned silence. Between the four adults, we hold six degrees. Three of us are journalists. And not one of us had thought to call the police. We had not even considered it.\n\nWe also are all black. And without realizing it, in that moment, each of us had made a set of calculations, an instantaneous weighing of the pros and cons.\n\nAs far as we could tell, no one had been hurt. The shooter was long gone, and we had seen the back of him for only a second or two. On the other hand, calling the police posed considerable risks. It carried the very real possibility of inviting disrespect, even physical harm. We had seen witnesses treated like suspects, and knew how quickly black people calling the police for help could wind up cuffed in the back of a squad car. Some of us knew of black professionals who'd had guns drawn on them for no reason.\n\nThis was before Michael Brown . Before police killed John Crawford III for carrying a BB gun in a Wal-Mart or shot down 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a Cleveland park. Before Akai Gurley was killed by an officer while walking in a dark staircase and before Eric Garner was choked to death upon suspicion of selling \"loosies.\" Without yet knowing those names, we all could go down a list of unarmed black people killed by law enforcement.\n\nWe feared what could happen if police came rushing into a group of people who, by virtue of our skin color, might be mistaken for suspects.\n\nFor those of you reading this who may not be black, or perhaps Latino, this is my chance to tell you that a substantial portion of your fellow citizens in the United States of America have little expectation of being treated fairly by the law or receiving justice. It's possible this will come as a surprise to you. But to a very real extent, you have grown up in a different country than I have.\n\nAs Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of The Condemnation of Blackness , puts it, \"White people, by and large, do not know what it is like to be occupied by a police force. They don't understand it because it is not the type of policing they experience. Because they are treated like individuals, they believe that if 'I am not breaking the law, I will never be abused.'\"\n\nWe are not criminals because we are black. Nor are we somehow the only people in America who don't want to live in safe neighborhoods. Yet many of us cannot fundamentally trust the people who are charged with keeping us and our communities safe.\n\nAs protest and revolt swept across the Missouri suburb of Ferguson and demonstrators staged die-ins and blocked highways and boulevards from Oakland to New York with chants of \"Black lives matter,\" many white Americans seemed shocked by the gaping divide between law enforcement and the black communities they are supposed to serve. It was no surprise to us. For black Americans, policing is \"the most enduring aspect of the struggle for civil rights,\" says Muhammad, a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. \"It has always been the mechanism for racial surveillance and control.\"\n\nIn the South, police once did the dirty work of enforcing the racial caste system. The Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement were often indistinguishable. Black-and-white photographs of the era memorialize the way Southern police sicced German shepherds on civil rights protesters and peeled the skin off black children with the force of water hoses. Lawmen were also involved or implicated in untold numbers of beatings, killings and disappearances of black Southerners who forgot their place.\n\nIn the North, police worked to protect white spaces by containing and controlling the rising black population that had been propelled into the industrial belt during the Great Migration. It was not unusual for Northern police to join white mobs as they attacked black homeowners attempting to move into white neighborhoods, or black workers trying to take jobs reserved for white laborers. And yet they strictly enforced vagrancy laws, catch-alls that gave them wide discretion to stop, question and arrest black citizens at will.\n\nMuch has changed since then. Much has not.\n\nLast Fourth of July, in a few short minutes as we adults watched the teenager among us talking to the police, we saw Hunter become a little more like us, her faith a little shaken, her place in the world a little less stable. Hunter, who is biracial and lives with her white mother in a heavily white area, had not been exposed to the policing many black Americans face. She was about to be.\n\nOn the phone, she could offer only the most generic of suspect descriptions, which apparently made the officer on the other end of the line suspicious. By way of explanation, Hunter told the officer she was just 16. The police called her back: once, twice, then three times, asking her for more information. The interactions began to feel menacing. \"I'm not from here,\" Hunter said. \"I've told you everything I know.\"\n\nThe fourth time the police called, she looked frightened. Her interrogator asked her, \"Are you really trying to be helpful, or were you involved in this?\" She turned to us, her voice aquiver. \"Are they going to come get me?\"\n\n\"See,\" one of us said, trying to lighten the mood. \"That's why we don't call them.\"\n\nWe all laughed, but it was hollow.\n\nMy friend Carla Murphy and I have talked about that day several times since then. We've turned it over in our minds and wondered whether, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have called 911.\n\nCarla wasn't born in the United States. She came here when she was 9, and back in her native Barbados, she didn't give police much thought. That changed when she moved into heavily black Jamaica, Queens.\n\nCarla said she constantly saw police, often white, stopping and harassing passersby, almost always black. \"You see the cops all the time, but they do not speak to you. You see them talking to each other, but the only time you ever see them interact with someone is if they are jacking them up,\" she said. \"They are making a choice, and it says they don't care about you, it tells you they are not here for your people or people who look like you.\"\n\nCarla herself was arrested at a young age-because she was present when her cousin pushed through a subway turnstile without paying. The teenagers were cuffed, thrown in a paddy wagon, booked and held overnight. At 15, Carla, then a student at The Dalton School, a prestigious private academy in Manhattan, had an arrest record.\n\nThat experience, along with many others, informed Carla's decision on July 4.\n\n\"I am a responsible adult, but I really can't see having a different reaction. Isn't that weird?\" she told me. \"By calling the police, you are inviting this big system-that, frankly, doesn't like you-into your life. Sometimes you call and it is not the help that comes.\"\n\n\"So, no, I wouldn't call the police,\" she said. \"Which is sad, because I want to be a good citizen.\"\n\nI moved to the historic Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn in 2011. Before then, I had been living in Portland, Oregon, and when I chose my new home in the gritty big city, it was partly because it was only a block away from a police precinct. That proximity made me feel safer-I figured crime would be less common with so many police nearby. Inadvertently, however, I also picked a prime target area of the city's stop-and-frisk program-a system of policing that caught so many innocent black and brown men in its dragnet that a federal judge found it unconstitutional in 2013.\n\nMy block is fairly typical of Bed-Stuy. My neighbors, until recently, were all black and included everyone from laborers to college professors. Both immaculately kept brownstones and boarded-up townhouses line my street. We have block meetings and a community garden. Police are a constant presence, speeding down the street to the precinct or walking the beat. Sometimes, I escort my daughter to the store underneath police watchtowers with tinted windows that pop up around the neighborhood with no warning, then disappear just as suddenly-their entire existence ambiguous yet alarming. I have witnessed from my window, countless times, police stopping someone, usually a young man, who is walking down the street. These men are often searched and questioned as they go to the bodega or head home from work or school.\n\nA few months ago, a police officer approached my neighbor as he was leaving the bodega and began questioning him. My neighbor is quiet and respectful, but he also is poor and transient. He tends to look disheveled, but the worst thing I've seen him do is drink beer on the stoop.\n\nWhen he asked why he was being stopped, the police grabbed him and threw him to the ground. As someone recorded the incident on a cellphone, police shot my neighbor with a Taser gun and then arrested him.\n\nHe was never told why police stopped him. The only thing they charged him with was resisting arrest. But this arrest cost him his job and a fine he will struggle to pay. If he doesn't pay, a judge will issue a bench warrant, and instead of preventing crime, the police will have created a criminal.\n\nCrowds of mostly white protesters have defied Ohio's stay-at-home order without arrest, while in several of the state's biggest jurisdictions, police departments have primarily arrested black people for violating the order.\n\nAcross the street and a few doors down from me, my neighbor Guthrie Ramsey has his own story. Guthrie was born in Chicago and grew up in a family that did not emphasize the obstacles their children would face. \"I was socialized to believe that the police were our friends,\" he said.\n\nYet one night, some years ago, while driving his teenage son to a soccer game, Guthrie was pulled over by police. Within minutes, he and his son were sprawled on the ground, with guns drawn on them. The police believed Guthrie fit the description of a suspect. Guthrie, a short, easy-going guy with a contagious laugh, managed to point the police to his University of Pennsylvania faculty ID. That's right: He's an Ivy League professor. And a noted musician.\n\n\"It was so frightening. It was humiliating. You get so humiliated that it's hard to even get to the anger,\" he told me. \"You just don't get to experience interactions with the police as a garden-variety circumstance.\"\n\nThese types of stories in black communities are so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable. If my husband is running very late and I cannot get hold of him, my mind does not immediately go to foul play. I wonder if he's been detained.\n\nThis fear is not unjustified. Young black men today are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than young white men. Still, it's not that black Americans expect to die every time they encounter the police. Police killings are just the worst manifestations of countless slights and indignities that build until there's an explosion.\n\nSince 1935, nearly every so-called race riot in the United States-and there have been more than 100-has been sparked by a police incident, Muhammad says. This can be an act of brutality, or a senseless killing. But the underlying causes run much deeper. Police, because they interact in black communities every day, are often seen as the face of larger systems of inequality in the justice system, employment, education and housing.\n\nIn the months since Ferguson, many pundits have asserted that black Americans deserve this type of policing, that it is a consequence of their being more likely to be both the perpetrators and victims of violent crime. \"White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,\" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani argued on Meet the Press as the nation awaited the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown shooting. It should be noted that Giuliani oversaw the NYPD during two of the most notorious cases of police brutality in recent memory, the sodomy of Abner Louima and the death of Amadou Diallo , who was unarmed, in a hail of 41 bullets. Both were black men.\n\nWhat Giuliani was saying, in essence, is that law-abiding citizens deserve to be treated with suspicion because they share racial traits with the tiny number among them who commit crimes.\n\nBlack communities want a good relationship with law enforcement because they want their families and property to be safe. After all, it is true that black communities often face higher rates of crime; in 2013, more than 50 percent of murder victims across the country were black, though only 13 percent of the total population is. But it's also true that crime reduction efforts by black people in black communities have contributed to the recent, historic drop in crime across the country.\n\nSo why are black Americans still so often denied the same kind of smart policing that typically occurs in white communities, where police seem fully capable of discerning between law-abiding citizens and those committing crimes, and between crimes like turnstile-jumping and those that need serious intervention?\n\n\"You can be protected and served,\" Muhammad says. \"It happens every day in communities across America. It happens all the time in white communities where crime is happening.\"\n\nDuring the height of the \"Black Lives Matter\" protests, a mentally ill man shot and killed two police officers a few blocks from my home. I lay up that night thinking about those two men and their families. No one wants to see people killed. Not by police, not by anyone. The next morning, my husband and I took food and flowers to the grim brick precinct right around the corner from us that the officers were working out of when they were killed.\n\nThe officer at the front desk did not greet us when we came in. And he looked genuinely surprised by our offering, his face softening as he told us we didn't have to do this, but thank you. That people who should be allies somehow felt like adversaries troubled me.\n\nThe next day, I drove by the precinct on my way to the store. It had been cordoned off with metal barricades. Two helmeted officers stood sentry out front, gripping big black assault rifles, and watching. The message felt clear.\n\nThey weren't standing out there to protect the neighborhood. They were there to protect themselves from us.\n\nFor more of Nikole Hannah-Jones' work on race and inequality in the nation's schools and neighborhoods, see School Segregation, the Continuing Tragedy of Ferguson .\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones covered civil rights and fair housing for ProPublica.

      "text": "Chicago's \"Race-Neutral\" Traffic Cameras Ticket Black and Latino Drivers the Most\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen then-Mayor Richard M. Daley ushered in Chicago's red-light cameras nearly two decades ago, he said they would help the city curb dangerous driving. \"This is all about safety, safety of pedestrians, safety of other drivers, passengers, everyone,\" he said.\n\nHis successors echoed those sentiments as they expanded camera enforcement. \"My goal is only one thing, the safety of our kids,\" Rahm Emanuel said in 2011, as he lobbied for the introduction of speed cameras. And in 2020, Lori Lightfoot assured residents her expansion of the program was \"about making sure that we keep communities safe.\"\n\nBut for all of their safety benefits, the hundreds of cameras that dot the city - and generate tens of millions of dollars a year for City Hall - have come at a steep cost for motorists from the city's Black and Latino neighborhoods. A ProPublica analysis of millions of citations found that households in majority Black and Hispanic ZIP codes received tickets at around twice the rate of those in white areas between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe consequences have been especially punishing in Black neighborhoods, which have been hit with more than half a billion dollars in penalties over the last 15 years, contributing to thousands of vehicle impoundments, driver's license suspensions and bankruptcies, according to ProPublica's analysis.\n\n\"We felt the brunt of it the way white people didn't,\" said Olatunji Oboi Reed, a longtime activist for racial equity in transportation in Chicago who has received a handful of camera tickets over the years. \"Fortunately, I've always been in a situation where I can survive financially, unlike many Black and brown people in the city; one ticket is throwing their whole finances in a hurricane.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic widened the ticketing disparities. Black and Latino workers have been far less likely than others to have jobs that allow them to work remotely, forcing them into their vehicles more often. In 2020, ProPublica found, the ticketing rate for households in majority-Black ZIP codes jumped to more than three times that of households in majority-white areas. For households in majority-Hispanic ZIP codes, there was an increase, but it was much smaller.\n\nSimilar racial and income disparities in camera ticketing have been documented elsewhere. In Rochester, New York, officials eliminated the city's red-light camera program in 2016 in part because motorists from low-income neighborhoods received the most tickets and the financial harm outweighed any safety benefits. Miami ended its program in 2017 amid complaints from low-income residents who felt unfairly burdened by the fines. And in Washington, D.C., racial justice advocates are researching the city's camera-ticketing program after a local think tank in 2018 and The Washington Post last year found that cameras in Black neighborhoods issued a disproportionate share of tickets there.\n\nA weekly newsletter about wrongdoing in America\n\nThanks for signing up.

From California to Virginia , citizens groups, safety organizations , elected officials and others are pointing to cameras as a \"race-neutral\" alternative to potentially biased - and, for many Black men, fatal - police traffic stops.\n\nAnd more funding for cameras may be coming: The federal infrastructure bill passed last fall allows states to spend federal dollars on traffic cameras in work and school zones.\n\nIn Chicago, officials have known of disparities since at least April 2020, when a pair of professors at the University of Illinois Chicago shared initial research showing that cameras send the most tickets to predominantly Black ZIP codes. The city then hired them to study the issue further.\n\nSix months later, Lightfoot - who campaigned in part on ending what she called the city's \"addiction\" to fines and fees - proposed that Chicago expand camera ticketing by lowering the speeds at which cameras will issue citations. Lightfoot called it a public safety measure, especially in light of a spike in traffic fatalities during the pandemic, but many observers called it a money grab. The City Council approved the measure as part of the 2021 annual budget.\n\nAfter the change went into effect last March, racial disparities persisted, ProPublica found.\n\nWhen asked why the city expanded the program despite knowing of the racial disparities, Dan Lurie, Lightfoot's policy chief, said the administration saw that traffic fatalities were \"at epidemic levels\" and that was a \"deep concern\" to the mayor. \"We feel strongly,\" he said, \"that cameras are a tool in the toolkit to help alleviate that.\"\n\nThe city is not considering eliminating the cameras or shrinking the program, though Lurie said the administration would \"evaluate\" cameras at locations where there's evidence they do not reduce crashes.\n\nA summary of the UIC research provided to ProPublica last week confirmed the racial disparities in red-light and speed-camera ticketing and found that most of the speed cameras improve safety.\n\nCity officials said they are trying to mitigate the financial harm caused by camera tickets. They pointed to a pilot program that halves the costs of fines and allows for some debt forgiveness for low-income residents. That initiative, which was announced last year with no mention of the racial inequities baked into the camera program, is scheduled to start by the end of March.\n\nLurie said the administration has been grappling with the \"twin challenges\" of improving traffic safety while \"very intentionally ensuring that the burdens of fines and fees as a result of those kinds of efforts do not fall disproportionately on Black and brown residents.\"\n\nThe irony is that some of the factors that contribute to ticketing disparities, such as wider streets and lack of sidewalks in low-income communities of color, also make those neighborhoods more dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists and even motorists. According to a 2017 city report, Black Chicagoans are killed in traffic crashes at twice the rate of white residents.\n\nThe city's latest transportation plan , which has a focus on racial equity, lays out a number of projects, such as improving crosswalks and building more bike lanes. City officials also said they plan to install more flashing signs that show drivers how fast they're going - devices known to help reduce speeds.\n\nLurie acknowledged that the best way to reduce traffic fatalities is to fix the underlying road infrastructure that contributes to unsafe driving. That way, he said, \"Pedestrians are safer, you're safer and no one's getting a fine. That's the ideal outcome here. We are dealing with, in many ways, after-the-fact consequences of streets that need to be rethought and redesigned.\"\n\nChicago's automated camera program began in 2003, after a 30-day \"experiment\" on opposite ends of Western Avenue recorded some 4,500 red-light violations. Over the next decade, the Daley administration installed cameras at dozens of intersections around the city.\n\nEmanuel expanded the program further in 2013 to include speed cameras.\n\nThe Lightfoot-era expansion happened, fundamentally, through lowering the speed limit threshold for tickets, not by adding more cameras.\n\nToday, motorists are monitored by cameras at close to 300 locations around the city, making Chicago's automated traffic enforcement program one of the largest in the country. Both red-light and speed cameras are distributed roughly evenly among the city's Black, Latino and white neighborhoods.\n\nThe cameras capture images of a vehicle's license plate as well as video of the alleged infraction, which is reviewed by a third-party vendor before a ticket is sent to the vehicle owner.\n\nEach year the city issues approximately 1 million camera tickets, about evenly split between the two types of infractions. In all, cameras have generated more than $1.3 billion in revenue since the first one was installed nearly two decades ago.\n\nIn general, research has found that the cameras help reduce serious accidents by changing driver behavior. Northwestern University researchers found in 2017 that the number of T-bone crashes - where one vehicle drives into the side of another - fell after red-light cameras were installed, as fewer people ran red lights. According to the executive summary of the latest research by UIC associate professors Stacey Sutton and Nebiyou Tilahun, speed cameras reduced the expected number of fatal crashes and those leading to severe injury by 15%.\n\nStill, a wide array of observers has criticized the program as a revenue generator more than a public safety solution. Tickets for running a red light or going 11 or more miles per hour over the limit cost $100; with late penalties that figure can grow to $244. Citations for driving between 6 and 10 mph over the limit cost $35, an amount that increases to $85 when late.\n\nAlmost half of the tickets received by low-income residents end up incurring additional penalties, according to the research by Sutton and Tilahun, both of whom are in UIC's College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. For upper-income residents, 17% of tickets end up with additional fees.\n\nOver the years, many residents have protested that the camera tickets hurt poor people who struggle to pay the fines in time to avoid hefty late penalties and collections fees.\n\nThe issue became a priority for Reed, who leads the nonprofit Equiticity, an advocacy and research organization focused on transportation equity, when he saw how much the city relied on enforcement as a strategy to help eliminate traffic fatalities in the Vision Zero Chicago plan published in June 2017.\n\nHe has for years called on the city to stop ticketing cyclists in Black and Latino neighborhoods for riding on sidewalks and to instead improve infrastructure in those areas. He is keenly aware that people of color are disproportionately killed in traffic accidents in Chicago and across the country. But he says he doesn't think the city can ticket its way to safer streets.\n\nAt a September 2017 meeting, Reed and others asked city transportation officials to identify and eliminate any racial or geographic disparities in camera ticketing, emails show. The city never committed, Reed said.\n\n\"We didn't subscribe to this notion that the answer to improved traffic safety is a punitive approach,\" he said. \"The root cause of traffic violence in our society that is disproportionately impacting Black and brown people is structural racism.\"\n\nThe following February, ProPublica reported on how debt from parking and camera tickets disproportionately piled up in Chicago's Black neighborhoods, sending tens of thousands of people into bankruptcy. The reporting has prompted significant reforms across the state.\n\nThis is the first time ProPublica has examined the disparities in camera ticketing itself, not just the financial consequences. The analysis relies on information obtained through public records requests from the city's ticket database, including the ZIP code associated with the vehicle registration for every camera ticket issued since the program's birth in 2003 through mid-2021.\n\nProPublica's main analysis relies on ticketing from 2015 through 2019 to correspond with the most recent five-year census survey data. Ticketing rates were calculated based on the number of households in each ZIP code, as there is no available and reliable measure of motorists or vehicles by ZIP codes that covers that period.\n\nThe data shows how motorists from Black and Latino areas of the city have consistently received a higher share of camera tickets. The disparity persists when you include motorists who live anywhere in Cook County but drive in the city or if you include speed warnings to first-time violators. ProPublica excluded warnings from its main analysis because they carry no financial penalties.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, some 3.1 million camera tickets went to Chicago residents. The highest share, or about 38%, of those tickets went to motorists from majority-Black ZIP codes. By comparison, those ZIP codes account for 27% of households.\n\nThe disparity is less severe in majority-Hispanic ZIP codes, which account for 19% of tickets and 16% of households.\n\nHouseholds in the city's majority Black ZIP codes received about four citations per household over that time period. That's more than twice the rate for households in majority-white ZIP codes, which received fewer than two tickets. Households in Hispanic ZIP codes received more than three tickets per household during the same time period.\n\nFor their study, which relies on census-tract level ticket data, Sutton and Tilahun looked at a shorter time period, 2016 through 2019, and arrived at a similar conclusion.\n\nRodney Perry has been caught in the cycle of ticketing. The 28-year-old entrepreneur quit his job at a logistics firm last spring to build a digital marketing and production company. The work leads him to drive past the city's cameras more than he did in his previous job. Last year, Perry received three tickets for running red lights and eight for speeding. Of the speeding tickets, five were for going just 6 or 7 mph over the limit - speeds that would not have triggered a ticket before Lightfoot lowered the threshold for tickets.\n\nHe paid some off, but the penalties eventually added up to more than $700, money he said he did not have. He tried to get on a city payment plan but said he couldn't figure out how to do that online. Because of the unpaid tickets, the city in November immobilized his 2018 Jeep Cherokee with a yellow Denver boot clamped over one of the front wheels outside his apartment. Perry had to borrow money from his older sister in Tennessee to get on a payment plan and get the boot removed, a process that came with yet more fines.\n\n\"Family doesn't ever want to see you have any moment of struggle,\" said Perry, who took on an extra job at a restaurant to help pay off the tickets and make ends meet. \"It's a financial impact, but mentally it's where I was affected the most. Mentally and emotionally.\"\n\nPerry said he takes responsibility for getting tickets. But he can't help but notice something every time he drives through majority-Black neighborhoods: There are fewer pedestrians and more vacant lots and industrial areas.\n\n\"It's almost like you feel like there is nothing there. Nothing to slow you down,\" he said.\n\nWhen Perry enters more densely populated Latino neighborhoods, he sees bustling commerce and more pedestrians. And in majority white neighborhoods, there are even more pedestrians and \"a stop light every few blocks. A stop sign between those. Crosswalks,\" he said. \"There's a million reasons to stop once you pass downtown on the North Side.\"\n\nIt all makes him wonder: Does the way a neighborhood looks affect whether a driver will get a ticket?\n\nConsider the speed camera on West 127th Street, a few blocks east of South Halsted Street in West Pullman, a majority-Black neighborhood on the city's Far South Side.\n\nThe camera sits next to a fenced-in steel plant, overlooking a busy, four-lane stretch of road where the speed limit is 30 mph. What allowed the city to place a camera there - as speed cameras are only allowed near parks or schools - is a bike trail that cuts across the street a little west of the device. It's not a frequently used path; on a bright October morning, not one cyclist passed through in the half hour or so a pair of reporters observed the trail. No pedestrians walked along that stretch of West 127th Street, either; only one side of the street even has a sidewalk.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of semitrucks and passenger vehicles roared past.\n\nAbout 20 miles north, another camera stands along a two-lane stretch of West Montrose Avenue that borders Horner Park in the whiter, more affluent Irving Park neighborhood.\n\nHere, the speed limit is also 30 mph. Drivers have to slow down to maneuver around a concrete pedestrian island and over bright green and white crosswalks that lead into the park. That same October morning, reporters encountered more than a dozen pedestrians, cyclists, dog walkers and others near the camera in about a half hour.\n\nIn 2020, the camera on West 127th Street issued 22,389 tickets to motorists caught driving 11 mph or more over the speed limit, each costing $100.\n\nThe one on West Montrose Avenue? Five.\n\nDrivers intuitively slow down when confronted with narrowed streets, speed bumps or other traffic, said Jesus Barajas, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California Davis, who has studied transportation and infrastructure in Chicago. Wide roads without what are often called calming measures, like the ones on West Montrose Avenue, encourage speeding.\n\n\"If it feels like a highway, you're going to go 50,\" Barajas said.\n\nProPublica found that all 10 locations with the speed cameras that issued the most tickets for going 11 mph or more over the limit from 2015 through 2019 are on four-lane roads. Six of those locations are in majority Black census tracts.\n\nMeanwhile, eight of the 10 locations where the fewest tickets were issued are on two-lane streets. And just two of the 10 are in majority Black census tracts. (The analysis focused on cameras near parks, because those devices operate for more hours and days than those by schools, leading them to issue the vast majority of tickets.)\n\nResidential density is another factor. Denser neighborhoods have more cars, more traffic and more pedestrians, all factors that cause motorists to intuitively slow down, experts said.\n\nAnd in Chicago, which has seen an exodus of Black residents in recent decades, Black neighborhoods are far less dense than their white counterparts.\n\nProPublica found that the 10 locations with speed cameras that issued the most tickets were in census tracts with about 6,400 people per square mile, on average. By comparison, the 10 locations with speed cameras that issued the fewest tickets were in tracts that, on average, were more than twice as dense.\n\nAnother factor in ticketing: proximity to expressways, which decades ago were built over Black communities in Chicago and across the nation. Seven of the 10 intersections with red-light cameras that issued the most tickets are within a block of an expressway entrance. Six of the 10 are in majority Black census tracts. None of the 10 intersections where red-light cameras issued the fewest tickets are near expressways, and just one is in a majority Black tract.\n\nSutton and Tilahun also found that ticketing levels are highest among red-light cameras located within 350 feet of freeways, and that Black neighborhoods account for a disproportionate share of all cameras near freeways, according to the executive summary of their paper.\n\nThe UIC researchers also found that red-light cameras in areas where there were high rates of violent crime issued more tickets. \"Perhaps people drive differently in those areas,\" Tilahun said. \"They might rush through intersections because they feel unsafe.\"\n\nCensus estimates show that Black residents are about as likely to drive to work as white residents, though they face longer commutes no matter how they get to work, according to a study by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which works on planning issues in northeastern Illinois.\n\nLow-income Black neighborhoods often lack basic amenities such as grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals, forcing drivers into their cars for longer periods of time, said Alejo Alvarado, a transportation planner who has written about how replacing traffic stops with speed cameras could disproportionately hurt low-income and minority drivers in Oakland, California.\n\n\"There's usually not retail investment or housing investment, so a lot of these communities, they're food deserts. They don't have the amenities they need,\" Alvarado said. \"I can't just walk down the street to get my groceries; I've got to drive somewhere else.\"\n\nWhen Lightfoot was running for office in 2019, she promised to reform the city's system of ticketing and debt collection. \"We cannot accept a system that has such a devastating impact on low-income people and people of color,\" she said.\n\nThe mayor has made good on her promise. The city ended a long-standing practice of seeking driver's license suspensions for unpaid parking tickets, and state lawmakers ended suspensions for any kind of ticket debt, including for unpaid camera tickets. The city has also made ticket payment plans more accessible; it used to be cheaper for motorists with a lot of ticket debt to file for bankruptcy than to get on a payment plan with the city.\n\nSo when Lightfoot proposed an expansion of the city's speed-camera program in October 2020, potentially sending tens of thousands of new tickets to the same populations already overburdened by fines and fees, it was widely seen as hypocritical. She was even criticized by some of the transportation safety advocates who support camera enforcement, including the influential Active Transportation Alliance.\n\nThough the mayor made an argument for traffic safety, alliance spokesperson Kyle Whitehead said his group suspected the proposal was more about revenue given it was made in the context of the city budget. What's more, he said, the change would be \"exposing more people to tickets without really understanding the racial equity impact of that change.\"\n\nBut Chicago officials did understand. When Lightfoot proposed the expansion, the city already had Sutton and Tilahun's preliminary findings. Sutton was dismayed to learn of the expansion.\n\n\"There's a disconnect between the data and the politics, the evidence and politics,\" Sutton said of the change. \"It doesn't align with the huge burdens that we see in the data.\"\n\nLurie defended the mayor's decision to expand the program even though the city had evidence of its disparate impact on communities of color. Lightfoot, he said, was particularly motivated after a decade-high spike in traffic fatalities in 2020.\n\n\"If someone is a reckless driver, that is a fundamental concern to the mayor,\" Lurie said. \"That fine and fee, we believe, can help change behavior. That fine and fee should not put someone in a place where they are unable to pay it, where they are making choices about whether they could put food on the table instead of paying that fine or fee.\"\n\nThe impact of lowering the speed limit threshold was huge. In 2021, the city issued more than 1.4 million tickets to motorists going 6 to 10 mph over the limit, more citations of that kind than it had issued in the combined previous eight years of the program's existence. The tickets, if paid, had the potential to bring in some $50 million in revenue.\n\nBut not everybody can pay their tickets, and the debt can upend lives. Late payments can lead to a boot being placed on a car, which might mean days away from work, making it harder to catch up with the debt. While unpaid tickets may no longer result in a license suspension, it's easy for Chicagoans to get caught in the cycle.\n\nRead More\n\n\"We end up fixing something and creating a different kind of harm,\" said Priya Sarathy Jones, the national policy and campaigns director at the Fines and Fees Justice Center, which sees cameras playing a larger role in cities' efforts to prevent traffic fatalities. \"It removes police from having contact with predominantly Black men and Black people, but you're also creating an entirely parallel universe of harm.\"\n\nSutton, who has long studied the impact of \"race neutral\" policies on communities of color, said Chicago's experience should be a cautionary tale for cities considering camera programs.\n\n\"It's the same cycle, right, in terms of their interaction with the state and with the justice system,\" Sutton said. \"But the way you enter that is not through a police officer, but through this supposedly unbiased technology. ... I don't think there's a technological fix to an unjust system.\"\n\nProPublica data reporter Haru Coryne reviewed the code and analysis.

      "text": "\"If Everybody's White, There Can't Be Any Racial Bias\": The Disappearance of Hispanic Drivers From Traffic Records\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with WRFK and WWNO. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nJoin reporters from both newsrooms on Thursday, Dec. 2 for \" Shielded ,\" a live virtual event about how law enforcement agencies shield themselves from accountability.\n\nWhen sheriff's deputies in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, pulled over Octavio Lopez for an expired inspection tag in 2018, they wrote on his traffic ticket that he is white. Lopez, who is from Nicaragua, is Hispanic and speaks only Spanish, said his wife.\n\nIn fact, of the 167 tickets issued by deputies to drivers with the last name Lopez over a nearly six-year span, not one of the motorists was labeled as Hispanic, according to records provided by the Jefferson Parish clerk of court. The same was true of the 252 tickets issued to people with the last name of Rodriguez, 234 named Martinez, 223 with the last name Hernandez and 189 with the surname Garcia.\n\nThis kind of misidentification is widespread - and not without harm. Across America, law enforcement agencies have been accused of targeting Hispanic drivers, failing to collect data on those traffic stops, and covering up potential officer misconduct and aggressive immigration enforcement by identifying people as white on tickets.\n\n\"If everybody's white, there can't be any racial bias,\" Frank Baumgartner, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina of Chapel Hill, told WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica.\n\nNationally, states have tried to patch this data loophole and tighten controls against racial profiling. In recent years, legislators have passed widely hailed traffic stop data-collection laws in California, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Virginia and Washington, D.C. This April, Alabama became the 22nd state to enact similar legislation.\n\nThough Louisiana has had its own data-collection requirement for two decades, it contains a loophole unlike any other state: It exempts law enforcement agencies from collecting and delivering data to the state if they have an anti-racial-profiling policy in place. This has rendered the law essentially worthless, said Josh Parker, a senior staff attorney at the Policing Project, a public safety research nonprofit at the New York University School of Law.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, attempted to remove the exemption two years ago, but law enforcement agencies protested. Instead, he was forced to convene a task force to study the issue, which thus far hasn't produced any results, he said.\n\n\"They don't want the data because they know what it would reveal,\" Duplessis said of law enforcement agencies.\n\nTo understand the impact of the state's unique policy, WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica looked at nearly six years of data on traffic citations issued by the New Orleans Police Department in the state's largest city, by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and by the state police in Jefferson Parish. The parish was chosen because it has the largest Hispanic population in the state, and because the Sheriff's Office, which is the primary police presence there, has been routinely accused by residents and local activists of harassing and profiling Hispanic people.\n\nThe data showed that of the almost 80,000 tickets that the Louisiana State Police handed out in Jefferson Parish over nearly six years, not a single one was issued to a person labeled as Hispanic.\n\nIt showed a similar pattern in Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office: Of the more than 73,000 traffic tickets the office issued between 2015 and September 2020, deputies identified only six of the cited people as Hispanic. As of 2020, Hispanics made up 18% of the parish's population of more than 440,000.\n\nBy contrast, the New Orleans Police Department issued about 7,000 tickets to Hispanic people during the same period when the Sheriff's Office claimed it issued only six. That represented 4% of all tickets in New Orleans, where the overall percentage of Hispanic people was 8% in 2020.\n\nBaumgartner said that in many law enforcement agencies, there is \"no real rhyme or reason or logic\" to how officers classify race. \"The white/black distinction is generally well recorded, but the Hispanic one is not. Many Hispanics are wrongly classified as white.\" The data bears out Baumgartner's point in an alarming way: Unlike Hispanic drivers, Black drivers in Jefferson Parish were cited at a rate 1.5 times what would be expected based on their share of the population.\n\nState Police spokesperson Lt. Melissa Matey, as an explanation for not counting Hispanics, cited the current National Crime Information Center standards, which don't include Hispanic as a race. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.\n\nWhile Hispanic is an ethnicity, more than 80% of law enforcement agencies use it as a race when collecting information from drivers during traffic stops, according to a sample of 69 departments studied by one expert on racial profiling.\n\nTraffic stops are the most common interaction between citizens and police, and often lead to finding people who have outstanding warrants or who are in the country illegally. As a result, they present the most opportunities for abuse and misconduct, said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nFailure to track and analyze traffic stop data has the potential to mask racial profiling, he cautioned, especially for the Jefferson Parish sheriff's department, which has long been plagued by charges of racism. A previous investigation by WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica found that more than 70% of the people Jefferson Parish deputies shot at during the past eight years were Black, more than double the parish's Black population. And 12 of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black men.\n\nBy failing to scrutinize the actions of its deputies during traffic stops, the Sheriff's Office is \"willfully blinding\" itself to the fact that it could be engaging in racially biased enforcement of the law, Fagan said. \"And they're blinding themselves to the fact that the inaccuracy rises to the level of a potential constitutional violation,\" he added.\n\nBased in part on the findings of the news organizations' investigation, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana sent a letter last week to the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana requesting a \"pattern-or-practice\" investigation into the Sheriff's Office, a type of inquiry that typically focuses on departments accused of systemic and institutional misconduct, abuses and corruption.\n\n\"For decades, JPSO, under color of law, has systematically violated the rights of Black and Brown people in Jefferson Parish,\" wrote Alanah Odoms, executive director. \"Rather than institute reforms in response to public outrage, the Sheriff's Office prefers to blame the victims and their families. A federal investigation is necessary and appropriate to address this pattern and practice of abuse.\"\n\nFor years, many in Jefferson Parish's Hispanic community have accused the Sheriff's Office of targeting them for stops with the intention of investigating their immigration status. In one high-profile case from 2017, Atdner Casco, a Honduran native, claimed he was beaten and robbed of more than $2,000 by deputies working on a task force dedicated to identifying and deporting undocumented people.\n\nCasco filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff's Office, which settled last year for $50,000. One detective was fired.\n\nCasco's attorneys, Casey Denson and Kenneth Bordes, said the stop and detention of their client - who is now eligible for a U visa, which grants permanent residency to crime victims - was a clear case of racial profiling conducted on behalf of immigration services. They pointed to a statement provided by the supervising detective on the scene that day who said, based on his eight years of experience working narcotics, \"Hispanic males\" are \"usually involved in some type of illegal activity.\"\n\nOver the last decade, similar allegations of discriminatory practices against Hispanic communities have prompted the Department of Justice to investigate law enforcement agencies in states including North Carolina, Connecticut, Arizona, Louisiana and New York.\n\nIn a 2011 report on New Orleans, DOJ investigators noted that \"Latinos in New Orleans, especially young Latino males, reported that NOPD officers stop them for unknown reasons or for minor offenses that would not ordinarily merit police attention, and then question them regarding immigration status.\" (Under a subsequent federal consent decree, the police department implemented a policy against inquiring about immigration status, and it now stops Hispanic people at a rate roughly commensurate with their share of the population.)\n\nPolice departments that allegedly engage in racial profiling typically share a common trait: a failure to collect and analyze traffic stop data, said Cheryl Phillips, co-founder of Stanford University's Open Policing Project, which has studied traffic stop data from more than 33 state law enforcement agencies and 57 of the largest city police departments in each state.\n\nConnecticut's East Haven Police Department, for example, was criticized by DOJ investigators for unfairly targeting Latinos in traffic enforcement, but also for \"woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify, track, and prevent such misconduct.\"\n\n\"How do they know that they're doing an effective job of not racially profiling if they don't actually look at their stops? If they don't actually evaluate their performance?\" Phillips said.\n\nAccording to the Policing Project at NYU, only 22 states and Washington, D.C., require the collection of data on traffic stops. And in those, \"many agencies store data in ways that make it difficult - if not impossible - to standardize and analyze, which in turn makes it difficult to identify patterns of behavior and inform changes to policy or practice,\" the authors wrote in a 2020 report.\n\nThis is the case in Louisiana, where efforts to rein in racial profiling have been halting at best. In 2001, the state legislature passed a statute that was supposed to improve data collection in traffic stops to combat biased policing. The statute requires officers to record the race, gender and age of drivers during all traffic stops. The race of the driver is to be based on the \"observation and perception of the law enforcement officer,\" according to the statute. It \"shall not be required to be provided by the person stopped.\"\n\nThe data is sent to the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, which is then supposed to send an annual report on to the governor and legislature.\n\nBut because of the law's provision that departments that have an anti-racial-profiling policy in place don't have to collect and deliver data, many don't. A report from the Southern Poverty Law Center found that in 2018, about two-thirds of the state's 331 law enforcement agencies had an anti-racial-profiling policy in place, exempting them from reporting data to the state. Of the 109 agencies that had no policy, only two had submitted data over the previous 18 years, according to the report, despite the law.\n\nThe statute's original sponsor, then-Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is now a White House senior adviser, originally hoped to create a million-dollar data collection system; when the legislature allocated no money to the effort, the exemption was added. In a 2001 Times-Picayune story, Richmond later said that the goal of the law had never been data collection, but ensuring that law enforcement agencies were discouraging racial profiling through policy.\n\nThat same story detailed how law enforcement agencies were scrambling to enact policies specifically to avoid a data collection process they described as \"overbearing.\"\n\n\"It's so hard. It's too much paperwork,\" then-Covington Police Chief Jerry DiFranco said of the data collection requirements.\n\nParker with the NYU Policing Project described Louisiana's carve-out as \"very unusual and unacceptable.\" Any law enforcement agency can write a policy against racial profiling, he said, but they must be able prove officers are adhering to the policy and that the policy itself is effective in eliminating racial disparities. And that's what the collection and analysis of data accomplishes.\n\nFailure to do so is the \"antithesis of democratic policing,\" Parker said.\n\nOn paper, Jefferson Parish's policy against racial profiling is clear: \"racial, ethnic, religious affiliation and gender-based profiling ... are totally unacceptable.\" Motorists are only to be stopped \"upon reasonable suspicion that they have committed, are committing or are about to commit an infraction.\"\n\nThe policy specifically addresses the misidentification of race. It states that \"the deliberate recording of any misleading information related to the actual or perceived race, ethnicity, gender, religious affiliation or sexual orientation of a person stopped ... is prohibited and a cause for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\"\n\nBut in practice, that policy does not appear to be enforced. The six stops identified as Hispanic represent .008% of all 73,000 stops made in a place where roughly 18% of the population is Hispanic. (The findings for white drivers is more complicated: The data shows white people were stopped at rates roughly equivalent to their share of the population, but that includes what appear to be thousands of Hispanic people wrongly categorized as white.)\n\nThe records indicated that Jefferson Parish deputies tend to classify Hispanic drivers as white: Five of the top 10 most common last names of people cited as \"white\" on tickets were Rodriguez, Martinez, Hernandez, Garcia and Lopez. That's basically impossible: the U.S. Census Bureau says more than 90% of people with those five last names are Hispanic.\n\nSeven experts on racial profiling who reviewed the Jefferson Parish data obtained by WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica said the level of misidentification is nearly unparalleled around the country. Three who have done in-depth studies of traffic stop data collection could name only one other law enforcement agency - the Texas Department of Public Safety - that engaged in the same practice to a similar extent.\n\nTo try to assess the actual numbers, the news organizations looked at the traffic stops by last name.\n\nWe looked at the top 10 names of white people cited in the list, which represented about 1,800 stops. Six of the top seven names were reported in the U.S. Census Bureau surname tables as more than 90% likely to belong to people who do not identify as white. We could not look at all names in our data set because among the less common last names, there were many for which we could not reliably assign a race.\n\nAccording to an attorney for the Jefferson Parish clerk of court, where the data is held, the misidentification is happening at the time of the stop. Traffic citations used by the Sheriff's Office are handwritten and include a blank space for race and sex. It is up to the deputy to determine the person's race or ethnicity, which they typically do by hand-writing single letters on the ticket: W for white, B for Black, A for Asian and H for Hispanic, for example.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office did not respond when asked whether their deputies are trained to exclude the category of Hispanic when determining someone's race.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office sends information from those forms to the traffic court, which uploads the data into its system, said Carey Daste, in-house counsel for the clerk of court. Daste and Donald Finger, judicial administrator for 1st Parish Court, said any errors occurring in the identification of someone's race or ethnicity are not happening on their end, as they are simply the recipients of the data and do not input any information themselves.\n\nThe Stanford project has evaluated more than 100 million records from law enforcement agencies across the country, and of those, only the Texas Department of Public Safety appears to have misidentified Hispanic people as consistently as the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, Phillips said.\n\nA Texas state law requires officers to record the race of every driver during traffic stops to combat racial profiling. But an investigation by TV station KXAN in Austin found that between 2010 and 2015, troopers with the Texas Department of Public Safety misidentified \"more than 1.9 million drivers with traditionally Hispanic names\" as white. And just like in Jefferson Parish, the \"most common last names of drivers stopped and recorded as white by troopers [were]: Smith, followed by Garcia, Martinez, Hernandez, Gonzalez and Rodriguez,\" according to the report.\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw said at the time the problem could be attributed to errors made by the troopers or flaws with the department's computer system, saying he would work to address both. A year after the 2015 investigation, the number of Hispanic people misidentified as white had dropped by more than 75% due to an increased focus on improving the accuracy of data collection.\n\nCritics, however, assert that misidentification by officers may be done on purpose, to conceal racial profiling. Alex del Carmen, an associate dean and professor at Tarleton State University's School of Criminology, Criminal Justice and Strategic Studies, said it is difficult to prove intent. At the same time, he added that it is \"inconceivable\" for a deputy to look at a person who speaks only Spanish, who is listening to Spanish music in his car, and who has the skin tone of someone of Hispanic descent, and to mark them as white without there being some intention behind the action.\n\n\"You could say the person was lazy,\" del Carmen said. \"You could also say, well, maybe the officer intentionally did that to be able to lower the number of individual Hispanics that he or she stopped, because they were being scrutinized.\"\n\nLocal activists and some Hispanic residents of Jefferson Parish do not believe that the misidentification of their ethnicity by deputies is a series of innocent errors, given the history of the Sheriff's Office.\n\nSince 2000, the Hispanic population in Jefferson Parish has more than doubled, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, growth driven in part by Central American immigrants arriving in search of work during the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina. Many of these immigrants settled in Jefferson Parish due to affordable rents and landlords willing to accommodate undocumented people.\n\nTensions escalated during the Trump administration, when anti-immigrant rhetoric was at its height. While New Orleans refused to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was at one time labeled a sanctuary city by state Attorney General Jeff Landry, the federal government found a willing partner in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"The Trump policy on immigration is the first one in a long time that has made any sense to me,\" then-Sheriff Newell Normand said in 2017. A year later, his successor, current Sheriff Joe Lopinto, told a group of Hispanic activists that he would continue the policies of his predecessor, \"even though it may lead to the deportation of undocumented immigrants,\" according to The Times-Picayune and The New Orleans Advocate .\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has awarded the Sheriff's Office multiple grants since 2017 to assist in the identification and deportation of undocumented people. One of the key tactics in doing so is traffic stops, which has left many Hispanic people in Jefferson Parish afraid to drive.\n\n\"I think we just leave our houses kind of terrified,\" said a local activist who asked to remain anonymous due to his immigration status. \"I'm white-knuckled on the steering wheel, just making sure I'm always going the speed limit and that everything on my car is perfect. Because for any tiny thing, you just don't know how the police might react and what could happen.\"\n\nWithout the data collection to depend on, determining whether Hispanic drivers have been stopped disproportionately often is difficult. The news organizations tried. To show there had been disproportionate ticketing of Hispanic motorists in Jefferson Parish, we would have needed a way to reliably reassign races to everyone in the data set, but there were many names that we could not reliably assign a race to. An analysis based on where drivers live was not possible given limited address information on the citations.\n\nNonetheless, Rachel Taber, a local immigration activist, said she has witnessed sheriff's deputies cruising predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, stopping people randomly, and then arresting them in coordination with ICE agents.\n\n\"People have learned through lived experience that the police are not someone you can go to for protection, but are dangerous to communities of color,\" Taber said.\n\nRead More\n\nConstantino Rodriguez was cited for driving without a license in 2019 and misidentified as white. He owns a concrete company, and he said sheriff's deputies routinely pull over his employees, who are mostly Hispanic and work in the construction industry, which is known to employ undocumented people.\n\n\"I was on vacation and my guys called me and said they got pulled over one block from the job because they didn't have seat belts on,\" he said. \"They asked for their IDs, asked where they were from and if they spoke English.\"\n\nRodriguez said this happens several times a week. The records showing that only six Hispanic people were cited over a six-year period, he said, are \"complete and utter lies.\"\n\nHannah Fresques and Irena Hwang contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The Scandal That Never Happened\n\nYears ago, the all-white judges of a Louisiana appellate court decided, in secret, to systematically ignore petitions filed by prisoners, most of them Black, who claimed they had been unjustly convicted.\n\nThis is the story of a horrendous injustice and the three people who tried to expose it. It begins with a suicide note.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nTwo years into his 25-year sentence for attempted aggravated rape, Nathan Brown could tell the man sitting across from him - a jailhouse lawyer improbably named Lawyer Winfield - was not going to help him get out of prison. It was astounding to Brown that he was pinning his hopes on a fellow inmate who had an eighth grade education and whose formal legal training amounted to a prison paralegal course. \"But he knew more than I did,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown laid out for Winfield the details of his case. In the summer of 1997, a woman was assaulted in the courtyard of the apartment complex in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where Brown was living with his mother. The woman, who was white, fended off the attacker with her high-heeled shoe until he fled on a bicycle. When sheriff's deputies arrived, a security guard suggested they question Brown - one of the few Black tenants in the complex.\n\nBrown, 23 at the time, was in his pajamas, rocking his baby daughter to sleep. The deputies put him in handcuffs and brought him to the victim. When she couldn't identify him, the officers allowed her to get close enough to smell him. She had told them her attacker had a foul body odor. Brown, she would later testify, smelled like soap; he must have showered immediately after, she speculated. In a trial that lasted one day, the jury found him guilty. After his appeal was rejected, he no longer had a right to an attorney provided by the state.\n\nWinfield began translating Brown's grievances into a legal petition. He argued that Brown's lawyer had provided ineffective counsel: He had overlooked the most basic defense strategies, failing to challenge the discrepancies in the victim's story and to insist on DNA testing. The two of them worked on the petition for months, so Brown was surprised when the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal delivered a rejection just a week later. The denial - a single sentence that didn't address any of Brown's claims - bore the names of three judges. But something didn't feel right. How could they return the ruling so quickly? Why was it so vague?\n\nThe answer to those questions would come years later, in the suicide note of a high-level court employee who disclosed that the judges of the 5th Circuit had decided, in secret, to ignore the petitions of prisoners who could not afford an attorney. It was a shocking revelation. In a state where police and prosecutorial misconduct frequently make national headlines and a stream of exonerations has revealed a criminal justice system still functioning in the shadow of slavery and Jim Crow, a group of white judges had decided that the claims of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of inmates - most of them Black - were not worth taking the time to read.\n\nAmong those petitions was Brown's claim that a DNA test would have proven his innocence.\n\nOn a warm Monday morning in May 2007, as the secretaries and clerks began filing through the glass doors of the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal, staff director Jerrold Peterson was inside his office with a 9 mm Beretta pistol. A letter he had written to the court's eight judges was making its way to the chambers of Chief Judge Edward Dufresne Jr. Versions of that letter were en route to the Judiciary Commission, the panel responsible for investigating allegations of judicial misconduct, and to the Times-Picayune, the state's most influential paper.\n\nPeterson hoped the letter would unleash a massive scandal - one that he had helped perpetuate for more than a decade. Fifty-five years old, Peterson had long been a fixture at the courthouse, and he reminded the judges that he had kept their secrets, clearing contempt charges against their friends and fixing traffic tickets whenever they asked. But he focused his rage on one secret in particular: their handling of appeals sent to the court by prisoners who claimed they'd been unjustly convicted.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help:\n\nLouisiana requires that a panel of three judges review all such petitions - known as pro se petitions, a Latin phrase that means \"for oneself.\" But Peterson wrote that the judges had instructed him to ignore the law and dispose of the appeals on his own. Dufresne, he explained, signed off on the documents \"without so much as a glance.\"\n\nThe implications were staggering. Over 12 years, the 5th Circuit, which is responsible for reviewing challenges from trial courts in four parishes, had disregarded at least 5,000 pro se petitions from Louisiana prisoners, according to the court's records. The inmates ranged from people convicted of murder to nonviolent offenders sent away for life. Many had limited education and struggled to present their arguments in the language of the courts. If Peterson's accusations were true, none of the judges had ever laid eyes on their claims.\n\nPeterson, who was known to keep his door open, didn't answer the business services manager when she came by to tell him that Dufresne wanted to see him. The chief judge instructed her to have the head of security unlock the door. As he slid in his passkey, the sound of a gunshot echoed through the building.\n\nA police detective arrived at the courthouse and found Peterson at his desk, slumped to one side, the Beretta still clutched in his right hand. The rest of the office, the detective wrote in his incident report, \"seemed to be void of any further evidence.\" When the officer searched the room a second time \"for a final attempt to locate a possible suicide note,\" Dufresne joined him. The chief judge didn't mention that he had already read Peterson's suicide letter. The detective, though, sensed something was amiss. In his report, he noted that Dufresne \"appeared to be evasive.\"\n\nThe 5th Circuit courthouse sits on the edge of downtown Gretna, a sleepy New Orleans suburb of 17,000 that serves as the government seat for Jefferson Parish. A tight bend in the Mississippi River separates Gretna from New Orleans, but politically and socially, the two are much further apart. Connecting the cities are twin bridges that became notorious after Hurricane Katrina when thousands of New Orleans residents tried to evacuate over the span but were forced back by a line of Gretna police officers. For many Black people in Louisiana, the moment encapsulated the hostility of the suburb, an area shaped by white families who had fled school desegregation half a century earlier.\n\nOn the Gretna side of the bridge, the road becomes the Harry Lee Expressway, named for a sheriff of the parish who was elected in 1979 and returned to office six times on a platform of aggressive policing. Lee once proudly announced that he had ordered his deputies to stop any \"young blacks\" they might find driving at night in a white neighborhood. \"There's a pretty good chance they're up to no good,\" he explained. During Lee's tenure, the voters of Jefferson Parish sent David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, to the Louisiana House of Representatives for a term.\n\nDufresne's ancestors were among the area's early settlers. His father, a plantation owner known as Big Eddie, built a white-columned brick home at the edge of his sugarcane fields in the neighboring parish of St. Charles. Dufresne, known as \"Little Eddie,\" launched his first campaign - a successful run for clerk of court - while he was still in law school. After he won a seat on the court, a local publication called him \"the Thomas Jefferson of St. Charles government\" and asked, \"Can Eddie Dufresne, Jr. go cold turkey on politics now that he's a judge?\" The answer was no. By the time he was elected to the newly formed 5th Circuit Court in 1982, he had become a power broker like his father, weighing in on disputes and promoting politicians he favored. Each spring, he hosted a lavish crawfish boil on the riverfront that drew sheriffs, businesspeople, judges and public officials.\n\nLong before he became chief judge in 2001, Dufresne dominated the 5th Circuit. On most weekdays, he would arrive at the courthouse in the passenger seat of one of his Cadillacs, driven by his longtime secretary, who would pick him up at the plantation house. Yet he was perceived by many as a \"real salt-of-the-earth kind of guy,\" as one lawyer put it. He earned the loyalty of staff by keeping work hours short - he would often leave at 2 p.m. - and wages high. \"Dufresne ran a court for the benefit of the judges,\" another lawyer told me.\n\nDuring a monthly meeting of the 5th Circuit's judges in 1994, he proposed changing how the court handled criminal pro se petitions, also known as writs. The minutes note the proposal but only in passing; it's sandwiched between a lengthy debate over plans to upgrade the court's computer system and a discussion about renting a new office copier. Dufresne's plan is described in two sentences: A three-judge panel would no longer rule on the petitions unless they were \"special or unusual\"; instead, Dufresne would oversee them himself.\n\n\"Administratively, it got somewhat cumbersome to have to select three-judge panels for every writ, because you'd get hundreds of them,\" said Bryan Pedeaux, who was Dufresne's longtime law clerk. \"So Dufresne said, 'Let's see if we can somehow streamline the situation.'\"\n\nAt the time, the 5th Circuit had the lowest caseload - and the lowest number of pro se petitions - of the state's five appellate courts. In the year preceding the meeting, it reported 235 criminal pro se petitions, fewer than one-tenth of the statewide total. The 4th Circuit, which includes New Orleans, reported 1,031.\n\nDufresne's proposal was in keeping with his judicial views, former staff members told me. He believed that people convicted of crimes were almost certainly guilty and that any issue they raised on appeal was an attempt to avoid paying for their actions. He almost never reversed a decision of the lower criminal courts. \"There was a total prejudice against all people charged and convicted of crimes,\" said a former law clerk. \"They never planned to give any of these people any relief anyway, so what difference does it make?\"\n\nThe minutes give no hint of why the judges believed they could circumvent the state's law. Although Peterson attended the meeting, his future role in drafting rulings on the court's behalf is not mentioned. Still, it was clear Dufresne was offering to substantially reduce the judges' caseloads: At the time of that meeting, more than 75% of the court's post-conviction petitions came from prisoners without an attorney. The change went into effect immediately.\n\nProPublica made multiple attempts to contact each of the three 5th Circuit judges who presided during the relevant years and are still alive. ProPublica also asked for comment from the 5th Circuit courthouse. None responded.\n\nEntrusted with overseeing the new protocol, Peterson developed a system to dispense with the prisoners' applications speedily. He drew up 15 rulings for his assistant to cut and paste; they were typically no longer than one or two sentences and ambiguous enough to fit a wide range of claims. A couple of the rulings were labeled \"grants\" but did little more than allow prisoners access to their trial transcripts.\n\nSixty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the Sixth Amendment guarantees all criminal defendants the right to an attorney. But in most states, including Louisiana, that right ends after an appeal of the initial conviction. Every subsequent appeal is part of the post-conviction process, an area of law that even experienced lawyers find challenging.\n\nJudges often view pro se appeals skeptically because they are filed by people who are not only untrained in the law but sometimes barely literate. Even liberal courts struggle with the high volume of petitions that lack merit. They are frequently assigned to clerks, who tend to recommend that judges dismiss them on technical grounds to avoid having to unravel what they see as frivolous or poorly made arguments. Still, the post-conviction process is essentially the only avenue prisoners have to introduce new evidence of their innocence or to persuade the court a defense attorney didn't do their job.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that state courts routinely send innocent men and women to prison. Researchers estimate that at least 1% of those serving time for violent offenses have been wrongfully convicted - roughly 7,000 inmates in state prisons alone - though they believe that number is much higher . Louisiana law says that people sentenced to death are entitled to court-appointed lawyers for all of their appeals. Subjected to such scrutiny, an astounding number of the state's prosecutions have fallen apart. Since 1976, 82% of Louisiana's death sentences have been overturned by appeals judges after defense attorneys exposed serious violations that occurred at trial. Most sentences were reduced to life; some prisoners were exonerated.\n\nThat statistic underscores a fundamental inequity. The people sentenced to lengthy or life sentences were arrested by the same police forces, prosecuted by the same district attorneys, represented by the same public defenders and convicted in the same courts as those on death row, but they are on their own. When they file a pro se petition asking Louisiana's appellate courts to reconsider their cases, they are at a significant disadvantage. Those petitioning the 5th Circuit after that meeting in 1994 had no chance at all.\n\nTo create the appearance of a proper review, former staffers said Dufresne formed a \"pro se committee,\" which included three judges who agreed to lend their names to Peterson's rulings. Whenever a judge on the committee retired, Dufresne appointed someone new. The nature of the pro se committee was an open secret at the courthouse. \"I knew what they were doing, and I knew it was unconstitutional,\" said one former clerk. \"Everyone knew about it.\"\n\nIn Louisiana, courts charge prisoners a fee for petitions - generally $50. Those costs are usually paid by parishes in which the defendants are convicted. By 1999, the 5th Circuit was charging $300. The money, paid by taxpayers, flowed into the 5th Circuit's discretionary fund. In a period when the state's criminal justice system was close to financial collapse, with some public defenders representing as many as 400 people at a time, records show that the 5th Circuit collected at least $1.7 million for the pro se petitions its judges did not read. Former 5th Circuit employees told me the judges spent the money on office furnishings, travel allowances - even for retired judges - and other perks the state didn't cover. When asked about the fund's expenditures, the 5th Circuit said it keeps financial records for only three years and could not provide an accounting.\n\nThe pro se petitions made up only a small part of Peterson's responsibilities. His primary task was to oversee the court's central staff, a group of lawyers who reviewed criminal petitions filed by attorneys and wrote recommendations for the judges. He also spearheaded the court's lobbying of the state legislature and oversaw the construction of the new court building. \"He loved that job more than anything in the world,\" a former colleague told me.\n\nAlthough Peterson often put in long days, he advised his staff to spend more time with their families. Those who knew him well said his devotion to his work seemed to rise and fall in proportion to what was occurring in his personal life, which was in a perpetual state of flux. Former colleagues said he was unhappy in his marriage and had several affairs with staff members. At times his home mail was delivered to the office, and some of his co-workers suspected he might sleep there on occasion. Putting his children through parochial school was a financial strain. One of his daughters had died in her teens, and a brother had killed himself. A devout Catholic, Peterson had a hard time reconciling his faith with his troubled marriage and bouts of depression.\n\nPeterson was born into a family of river pilots responsible for guiding ships through the lower Mississippi. It's one of the most lucrative jobs in the state, with pay frequently exceeding $700,000 a year. Peterson's grandfather, father and brother all held the job, and two of his sons now do. Peterson took a different path. After he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, he attended law school at Tulane University and took a job at a firm in New Orleans. He joined the 5th Circuit at age 37; his time with the court was interrupted only by his military service - as a reserve Marine colonel, he served in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\n\nAfter years of overseeing the scheme, Peterson sought out Karla Baker, who had worked at the court years earlier and with whom he had been romantically involved. Baker was much younger than Peterson, and their relationship had continued after she left the 5th Circuit and took a job as a defense attorney at a prominent New Orleans firm. Peterson told her he wanted someone else to know what the judges had asked him to do, and he gave her a copy of his list of denials and the minutes from the 1994 meeting. He asked her not to do anything unless she heard from him.\n\nOn Saturday, May 19, 2007, two days before his suicide, Peterson received a call from Dufresne, summoning him to the courthouse. When he arrived, Dufresne and two judges were waiting in the conference room, and it quickly became clear they were there to fire him. They had evidence that Peterson had tried to improperly sway a case - that he had directed his staff to write a memo advising the judges to rule in favor of a defendant. Peterson rarely, if ever, recommended relief, even in cases filed by attorneys. But this happened to be a case Baker was defending, and Peterson had intervened.\n\nSome law clerks had reported what they viewed as Peterson's misconduct to the judges. Dufresne wanted to let it go, but a new judge on the court insisted they launch an investigation, which also revealed that Peterson was having a relationship with one of his subordinates. It had become too much to ignore. After more than a decade of denying the appeals of defendants, he was being fired for trying to aid one.\n\nPeterson was blindsided. He had assumed he had a level of job security commensurate with the amount of dirty work he had done for the court. \"Jerry thought he was one of them,\" a former colleague told me. \"He thought he was unfireable because he knew all the court's secrets.\" Now, some of the same judges who had asked him to break the law were dismissing him for what struck him as comparatively small-scale misconduct.\n\nAfter the meeting, he sat down and began to write a letter to the judges. \"Not one criminal writ application filed by an inmate pro se has been reviewed by a judge on the court,\" he wrote. \"Who's integrity is really in question when you have conveniently ignored your duty to review pro se criminal writ applications so you can reduce your workload, present a false picture of the court's work, and charge large sums for work you haven't done?\"\n\nOn the morning of his suicide, Baker said, she received an email from Peterson: \"He said by the time he was finished it will be Gretnagate.\" But he underestimated the determination of the state's legal establishment to protect its own.\n\nThe Times-Picayune ran a short piece on the suicide a few days later. It described Peterson as a well-liked, reliable employee. A staff member told the paper that Peterson's problems were personal ones: \"As far as anyone knows it has nothing to do with anything here at the court.\" The article made no mention of the letter Peterson had sent to the paper.\n\nThe Judiciary Commission initiated an investigation into the 5th Circuit. A person familiar with the inquiry told me it focused on Dufresne, but it never became public and never had any consequences. Its findings were sealed and sent to a storage facility that was already filled with the records of other misconduct investigations that are not subject to the state's public records law.\n\nNone of the judges involved in the episode was disciplined. A few months after Peterson's suicide, the 5th Circuit quietly adopted a new policy for handling pro se petitions: A panel of three randomly selected judges would now review them, as Louisiana law required. No one, however, alerted the men and women whose petitions the court had improperly rejected and who were in prisons across the state.\n\nKarla Baker wanted no part of the mess Peterson had left behind. But she had loved him, despite their complicated relationship, and felt partly responsible for his unraveling. She knew that Peterson had gotten into trouble because he had tried to influence the judges in her case. Although she never asked for him to intervene, she said, she worried her own legal career could be in jeopardy.\n\nMore than 16 years after Peterson's suicide, Baker is still hesitant to talk about what happened, and unsure of how to cast herself in the story. Raised in Louisiana, she graduated from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law and began her career as a staff attorney for the state Supreme Court. When she joined the 5th Circuit as a law clerk in 2002, she was taken with Peterson's intelligence and kindness. He never spoke down to her, she said, despite her lack of experience. He seemed to know everything about the courthouse, and he was always willing to help. As they became closer, she came to see a dark side. He was deeply unhappy, haunted. \"He lived on the edge,\" Baker said, but felt powerless to change his own circumstances.\n\nPeterson could have taken his documents to the Innocence Project or another nonprofit dedicated to fighting the injustices of the Louisiana criminal justice system, but those were not his people. So, he had left it to Baker, who had never seen herself as an activist, to bring the scandal to light.\n\nBaker anguished about the matter for months. She was engaged to someone by then and was embarrassed about having had a relationship with a married man. She wanted to put the episode behind her. She said she decided to send an anonymous complaint to the Judiciary Commission, laying out some details of the 5th Circuit's pro se arrangement. She didn't know about Peterson's suicide letter or that he had sent the commission a copy. She waited for something to happen, but nothing did, even after she sent the commission a second letter, this time identifying herself as the one who sent the initial complaint.\n\nFinally, Baker took the documents that Peterson had given her and drove to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Roughly 130 miles north of New Orleans, the maximum-security prison sits on a former plantation that covered 18,000 acres and is named for the African country from which many of its enslaved people were taken. That year it housed some 5,200 inmates, most of whom were expected to die at the prison hospice.\n\nAngola was once considered the most violent prison in the United States. Brutal assaults and murders among the inmates were common, and the guards were known for sanctioning a system of inmate rape and sexual slavery. After decades of federal intervention and grudging reforms, the prison has largely shed that reputation. Vocational programs, recreational clubs and a Southern Baptist Bible college that has ordained hundreds of inmates have been credited with reducing the violence. Angola also established one of the best prison law libraries in the United States, a sanctuary of sorts where jailhouse lawyers help other prisoners challenge their convictions and sentences.\n\nAfter passing through security, Baker asked to see Ted Addison, a former client who could no longer afford her services but with whom she had kept in touch. Addison was halfway through a 20-year sentence for armed robbery. For years he had been petitioning the courts on his own, insisting he had been unfairly convicted.\n\nBaker handed Addison a sheaf of documents, which included the list of canned denials Peterson had developed and the minutes to the 1994 meeting. Addison was stunned. Like many other prisoners, he had spent years trying to get the 5th Circuit to grant him a new hearing. He had filed six pro se petitions, and each had come back almost immediately with a brief rejection.\n\nAddison took the documents to the prison law library. Here, amid the rows of concrete cubicles, they were both a revelation and a confirmation of what the jailhouse lawyers had long suspected. For years inmates had noticed an unusual pattern in denials coming from the 5th Circuit: They would arrive just days after the petitions were filed, a process that usually took months at the state's other appellate courts, and the perfunctory language never varied, with only the names and dates changing from case to case. Now it all made sense.\n\nThe jailhouse lawyers set about alerting the prisoners who had petitioned the 5th Circuit during the relevant years. They believed Peterson's accusations could revive their cases. Addison felt they were organizing \"a movement.\" He sent copies of Peterson's documents to inmate lawyers at the state's other prisons and introduced Baker to Kerry Myers, editor of Angola's award-winning prison magazine, The Angolite. Myers had been convicted of killing his wife in 1984 and was serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. He had filed five unsuccessful pro se petitions with the 5th Circuit. \"I actually had a lot of hope,\" Myers told me. \"I said, 'This thing is going to blow up.'\"\n\nWith Baker representing them, Addison and Myers filed a joint petition to the Louisiana Supreme Court, demanding an investigation into Peterson's allegations and new hearings for all of the prisoners whose appeals had been ignored. Within three months, the court received 299 petitions from men and women across the Louisiana prison system, most of them drafted from a form that Baker had provided.\n\nBaker also prodded the Times-Picayune to cover the story. The newspaper's first article, which focused on the prisoners petitioning the state Supreme Court, quoted the suicide note Peterson had sent the paper more than a year earlier. Baker, who hadn't known about the letter, filed a public records request to obtain a copy from the Gretna police. The Angolite ran a story as well, calling the 5th Circuit's pro se system a \"simple and lucrative process for disposing of the dispossessed.\"\n\nThe independent review the inmates were asking for presented a threat to the 5th Circuit. If it showed that judgments were unjust, the appeals court could be exposed to civil lawsuits. If the reviews revealed a wrongful conviction, Dufresne and the other judges could face serious discipline, especially since the state's laws against judicial misconduct take into account the harm the injustice has caused.\n\nThe probability that at least some of the 299 petitions had merit was high. More than 90% of the prisoners came from Jefferson Parish, where prosecutors were known for striking Black men and women from jury pools in felony trials at a rate more than three times as often as their white counterparts . Because the state had long allowed \"split jury\" convictions requiring only 10 of the 12 jurors to agree, many of the Black defendants whose petitions Peterson rejected were convicted by what amounted to an all-white jury.\n\nThe Jefferson Parish district attorney had also made aggressive use of the state's \"Habitual Offender\" law , which can turn a two-year sentence into life without parole; almost all of the cases involved Black defendants. Many of the prisoners asking for a review had been sentenced under the law and were serving life sentences for nonviolent offenses like drug possession and \"purse snatching.\"\n\nSome of the judges who had sent these men and women to prison had gained notoriety a few years before Peterson's suicide, when an FBI corruption sting revealed they had accepted cash bribes and campaign contributions in exchange for allowing a bail bonds company to dictate the amounts defendants were required to post. The scandal sent two judges to prison and unseated a third.\n\nMore than 85% of defendants in the state are considered indigent, meaning they qualify for a public defender when they are prosecuted. Louisiana's public defender system is widely considered one of the worst in the country. It relies primarily on traffic fines and court fees - an unpredictable source of revenue that has never come close to meeting the need. Offices across the state struggle with caseloads so large that they have no choice but to put defendants on long waitlists, leaving them in jail until an attorney becomes available. Some attorneys have so little time to prepare, they meet their clients for the first time on the day of trial.\n\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court did not grant the 299 petitioners an independent review of Peterson's rulings. Instead, it adopted a plan proposed by Dufresne and the other 5th Circuit judges: Rather than saddle another court, the 5th Circuit offered to reconsider the cases itself. \"We are guided in this request by a desire to avoid imposing financial or other burdens on other judges in this state,\" the 5th Circuit judges wrote. In October 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the 299 petitions to the 5th Circuit. (It did the same with another 155 that came later.) As part of the agreement, the 5th Circuit judges whose names had appeared on the Peterson rulings would not be involved in the \"reconsideration\" of the cases. New three-judge panels would decide whether the rulings, which their colleagues had never read, were nonetheless fair.\n\nWith new documents Baker had obtained through public records requests, including Peterson's suicide letter and the Gretna police report raising questions about Dufresne's behavior, Addison and Myers challenged the Supreme Court's decision. The documents, they wrote, \"show that all of the judges of the Fifth Circuit ... have an apparent or actual conflict of interest in this matter.\"\n\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court saw it otherwise, stating that it would not be appropriate to task the other appellate courts with the additional work or to spend $200,000 of the public's money to pay for retired judges to review the cases. Justice Catherine \"Kitty\" Kimball wrote that the court could not base its decision on the allegations of a depressed court clerk and an \"unsubstantiated\" police report about his suicide. \"While this may be the fodder of news reports and movies,\" she wrote, \"it is not, in my view, proper evidence for judicial action.\"\n\nWhile the Judiciary Commission inquiry was going nowhere, the state bar launched its own misconduct investigation - into Baker. The 5th Circuit judges had alerted the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board that Peterson had intervened on her behalf. The following year, she left the defense firm and went into practice for herself, representing drug offenders and pursuing damages in personal injury cases. The bar association kept the case against Baker open for almost a decade before sending her a letter saying it found no evidence of wrongdoing and was dropping the investigation.\n\nIt took the 5th Circuit three years to review the pro se petitions of 454 prisoners. The Times-Picayune and other local news outlets had by then dropped the story, so no one was paying attention when the judges found that, aside from a dozen procedural mistakes, Peterson's cut-and-paste denials had been correct. In one case after another, they wrote, \"there was no error in the prior rulings of this court.\" The court had investigated itself and found it had done nothing wrong.\n\nMyers' life sentence was commuted in 2013. Addison served out the remainder of his sentence and was released in 2016.\n\nAs for the 5th Circuit judges, they prospered in the years after Peterson's suicide. Some were picked to serve on the state Supreme Court; others enjoyed successful political careers. Dufresne remained the court's chief judge until he collapsed in the office of one of his businesses on December 7, 2010. His obituary in the Times-Picayune didn't mention the pro se scheme. In St. Charles Parish, there's a Judge Edward Dufresne Parkway, a Dufresne Loop and an Edward Dufresne Community Center, where a life-size bronze statue stands. He is wearing a suit with a lobster pin on his lapel and one of Lady Justice on his tie.\n\nThat might have been the end of the story but for an unusual confluence of events that landed a former federal law clerk with an extraordinary resumé in a prison bunk bed next to the last inmate still fighting the 5th Circuit's sham denials.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, Haller Jackson IV walked into Angola to serve out the remainder of a sentence for soliciting sex from a minor. He was 37 years old, 6-foot-4 and weighed 200 pounds, but he carried himself like a man who was doing his best to appear smaller. His right eye was blood red, a reminder of a beating he'd received a few weeks earlier at another prison.\n\nJackson had begun his sentence in Angola four years earlier. When his legal advocacy on behalf of fellow inmates called attention to, among other things, the prison's inadequate health care, he was transferred to Dixon Correctional Institute, some 35 miles away. After he was assaulted, Jackson said, his lawyer secured his return to Angola, as long as he promised to refrain from embarrassing the authorities.\n\nJackson was relieved to be able to resume his work as an inmate lawyer. He had a year and a half left on his sentence, and he wanted to make the most of it. As a registered sex offender, he likely would never be allowed to practice law. While he settled in that first day, a man in the adjacent bunk bed introduced himself. His name was Louie M. Schexnayder Jr., but in Angola everybody called him Schex.\n\nSchexnayder was convicted of murder in 1995. He'd petitioned the 5th Circuit 11 times during the period of Peterson's blanket denials, raising questions about the competency of his defense attorney and the testimony of a witness who later recanted. After the judges at the 5th Circuit affirmed Peterson's rulings, Schexnayder hired a lawyer to help him petition the federal courts.\n\nStanding in Schexnayder's way - and in the way of all the 5th Circuit petitioners who tried to take their cases to federal court - was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, at the height of his efforts to portray himself as a tough-on-crime Democrat. The law, known by its unwieldy initials as AEDPA, has made it all but impossible for federal judges to overturn criminal rulings by state courts.\n\nAEDPA was supposed to help deter domestic terrorism and expedite delays in carrying out capital punishment, but it did neither. The time between sentencing and execution is almost twice as long today as it was 27 years ago, and by most measures domestic terrorism has increased. But the law has significantly undermined habeas corpus, the constitutional safeguard that gives prisoners the right to challenge their incarceration.\n\nOne of the act's toughest restrictions, and the one keeping the Louisiana prisoners from taking their cases to federal court, requires federal judges to defer to state court rulings in all but the narrowest of circumstances. Federal judges can't step in just because a state court proceeding or ruling violated a prisoner's rights. They can reverse the state ruling only if it was so wrong that not a single \"reasonable jurist\" would agree with it. Before AEDPA, federal judges provided a critical safeguard. Unlike state judges, most of whom face reelection and can be loath to reverse convictions for fear of appearing \"soft on crime,\" they are appointed for life and are theoretically free from political pressure.\n\nSince AEDPA was enacted, state convictions based on the fabricated testimony of jailhouse informants or obtained by prosecutors suppressing or falsifying evidence are routinely upheld. Even in cases in which trial judges adopted the prosecution's brief as their ruling, typos and all , federal judges have declined to step in. Those who do have been repeatedly slapped down by the Supreme Court in opinions that further narrowed the grounds for federal review. If the better-known 1994 crime bill was intended to lock more people up, AEDPA effectively threw away the key.\n\nWhile some federal judges have tried to push back against AEDPA's restrictions, those in Louisiana have applied them with zeal. In case after case, Louisiana's federal courts have signaled to state court judges that virtually no violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights is so egregious as to warrant review. Dufresne's pro se scheme was no exception. When Schexnayder asked a federal district court for a new hearing in light of Peterson's revelations, the judge cited AEDPA in denying his request, and the federal appellate court affirmed. But on that day in January 2019, when Jackson climbed into the top bunk in the prison dormitory he shared with 85 other men, Schexnayder thought finally he might get the help he needed.\n\nAngola has produced some formidable jailhouse lawyers, but Jackson was unlike any of them. The son of a prominent family in Shreveport, he had studied law at Tulane, graduating first in his class with the highest grade-point average in the school's history. While also pursuing a doctorate in epidemiology, he served as editor-in-chief of the law review and shattered the school's record for the number of awards and honors earned by an individual student. The lives of most Angola prisoners were marked by extreme poverty; Jackson had grown up in extraordinary privilege. If he hadn't been gay, he believes he might have been a frat boy, practicing at the family law firm and going to the Shreveport Club for dinner, just as generations of Haller Jacksons before him had done. Instead, he distanced himself from that lineage. After graduating from law school, he landed several prestigious federal clerkships and focused his efforts on prisoner rights and habeas cases.\n\nBut it all came crashing down in 2014, when he was arrested in New Orleans after arranging online with an undercover agent to pay for sex with a 10-year-old boy. By his own account, he had become addicted to alcohol and dependent on methamphetamines. It was a spectacular downfall, and it made headlines in legal publications. Jackson pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to Angola. This was an unusual request. The prison still evokes fear and is generally reserved for people sentenced to more than 40 years. His lawyers were against it, but he insisted. \"It's my drag queen approach to life,\" he said. \"If you're going to send me to prison, well, send me to Angola.\"\n\nIt was also a way for Jackson to derive meaning from the wreckage. Angola is where Louisiana's injustices intersect most dramatically, and Jackson knew his rare expertise in post-conviction law would be valuable. He had always understood that pro se petitioners got short shrift, but in Angola he was shocked to see how many of the prisoners' claims had merit and how few managed to receive any attention from the courts.\n\nShortly after he arrived, Jackson met an inmate convicted of stealing a carpenter's level. He had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole under the state's repeat offender law; his previous crimes included stealing a pack of cigarettes and a lighter and writing two bad checks to Home Depot. The man, Jackson wrote in a petition arguing the sentence was illegal, will die in prison over a \"tool with a little bubble in it, worth less than $10.\" It was denied. Jackson petitioned the court on behalf of a man who had found evidence of his innocence in a police report the prosecutor had withheld at trial. His request for a new hearing was rejected. As was a filing on behalf of a severely disabled man who was still in prison months after he should have been released, and another for a man who claimed he had lost his vision because of the prison's neglect.\n\nAlmost all of Jackson's filings speak not just to the particulars of a specific case but to the devastation wrought by the entire Louisiana criminal justice apparatus. The state has more people serving life without parole than Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi combined. In a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for a man serving a life sentence for possession of cocaine, Jackson protested \"this destruction of another black family - perhaps a tiny tragedy in the civil rights Chernobyl that has been Louisiana's war on drugs.\" There was no evidence linking the man to the ounce of cocaine found at a relative's home, he wrote. \"And yet here he sits still, sentenced to life without parole on the banks of the Mississippi,\" he continued. \"As seen from the heavens, the scene on these banks has changed little since 1820.\" The petition was denied.\n\nBy the time Jackson met Schexnayder, his writing had progressed \"from disappointed but fundamentally-confident-in-justice liberal to just this side of burn-the-house-down nutter,\" he told me. The indignation he felt over the 5th Circuit's pro se cases was not because of the court's obvious indifference to the inmates; this he had come to expect. \"It's that the judges got caught saying they don't care,\" he said. \"The poor already knew this and have known it viscerally all their lives - from the way every arm of the state has ever treated them.\" But here was a case in which they had irrefutable proof, and still there was no outrage on their behalf. \"It was crickets,\" he said. \"They got caught so, so red-handed, and the response of all the other courts has been a collective shrug.\"\n\nSchexnayder, who had a criminal record so long that he would almost certainly have landed in prison for life much sooner had he been Black, could hardly be seen as the face of Louisiana's criminal justice failures. But of all the 5th Circuit petitioners, Schexnayder was the one who had somehow managed to keep his case alive. Jackson knew that a victory for him could open the door for the others. He began working on a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing the 5th Circuit's reconsideration of Peterson's denials did little more than allow the judges to \"whitewash the scandal .\"\n\n\"Why would the Louisiana 5th Circuit think it could get away with such appalling misconduct?\" Jackson wrote. \"To this there is an easy, if disturbing, answer: Because it has. And now, the lower federal courts are deferring to that court's decisions in the affected cases, many involving a sentence to life without parole.\"\n\nJackson realized the case was unlikely to get any attention unless he could line up some outside help. AEDPA had been a particular target of one of his mentors, Alex Kozinski, a federal judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for whom Jackson had clerked. Frequently mentioned as a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Kozinski had been one of the country's most prominent judges, a Reagan appointee known for his cutting and iconoclastic opinions. In a 2015 law review article, he wrote that AEDPA was \"a cruel, unjust and unnecessary law that effectively removes federal judges as safeguards against miscarriages of justice.\" He called for its repeal.\n\nBut like Jackson's, Kozinski's career had come to an abrupt end. In 2017, amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment, he left the bench. Within the legal world, especially around issues of criminal justice, however, his opinion still commanded respect, even among some of his accusers . Jackson knew that his involvement could draw attention to Schexnayder's petition. He called the former judge at his home in California. Kozinski thought the 5th Circuit's conduct - and the federal courts' unwillingness to wade into it - might provide a valuable test for AEDPA. The law requires deference to the work of state court judges, but what if those judges hadn't done the work? Kozinski asked the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to submit a brief in support of Schexnayder's petition and recruited another former clerk to write it.\n\nIn April 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court asked the state of Louisiana to submit a response to Schexnayder's claims, signaling that someone on the court was interested in considering the case. The justices were initially scheduled to vote in April on whether to grant a full hearing, but they postponed that decision nine times over the next eight months. The delays gave Jackson hope. Maybe one of the justices was working to drum up enough votes to give the case a chance or preparing a powerful dissent from the court's refusal to hear it.\n\nInstead, on Dec. 9, 2019, the court unanimously rejected the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a short opinion , citing technical issues with Schexnayder's original petition to the Louisiana federal court as her reason for agreeing with her colleagues' decision. She ended with what seemed like an encouraging note to the prisoners, saying the 5th Circuit's reconsideration of Peterson's rulings brings up \"serious due process concerns.\"\n\n\"I expect that lower federal courts will examine the issue of what deference is due to these decisions when it is properly raised,\" she wrote.\n\nBut the federal courts will not get that chance. The 454 prisoners whose denials the 5th Circuit \"reconsidered\" have exhausted their appeals and can no longer ask federal judges to weigh in on the 5th Circuit's conduct. In refusing to hear Schexnayder's case, the Supreme Court has prevented the episode from being raised in federal court again.\n\nWhen Jackson found out that Schexnayder's petition had been rejected, he struggled to articulate his reaction. After a long silence, he said, \"Well, they got away with it.\"\n\nSince they petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court, some of the 454 inmates have died in prison. Others have been released after serving their time or have had their sentences reduced as a result of recent criminal justice reforms. But at least 170, including Schexnayder, are still incarcerated. They continue to petition the appellate courts, trying to show new evidence of their innocence or to argue that their sentences should be reduced.\n\nAfter the Schexnayder episode, Jackson set his sights on the modest goal of filing as many petitions as he could before his release. \"I'm going to make them tell me they're OK with all these crazy cases,\" he said. When he walked out the prison gates in June 2020, he smuggled several office boxes containing case files he had secretly copied - documents he would use to help the men he was leaving behind. In the months that followed, Jackson found lawyers to represent dozens of prisoners and worked with legal nonprofits to reduce the sentences of more than 100 people. Among them are several men whose pro se petitions the 5th Circuit had ignored.\n\nIn the years that Peterson was rejecting pro se petitions, the 5th Circuit denied claims that ended in at least five exonerations. Four of these men were freed only after the New Orleans Innocence Project agreed to represent them. Nathan Brown was one of them. He had appealed to the organization early in his incarceration, and lawyers there had discovered that the victim's dress had been preserved as evidence and could be tested for DNA.\n\nHurricane Katrina put a stop to everything, though, and for a long time Brown heard nothing. While he waited, the 5th Circuit reviewed Peterson's denial and concluded that the failure of Brown's attorney to introduce DNA evidence was \"within the scope of trial strategy\" and did not constitute inadequate counsel.\n\nThen, on his 39th birthday, Brown received a letter from the national Innocence Project, saying it would take his case. Brown's new lawyers compelled the Jefferson Parish district attorney to send the dress for DNA testing, and the analysis identified another man - a convicted felon - as the attacker. In 2014, after 16 years, 10 months and 18 days, Brown was exonerated.\n\nRead More\n\nIt's been nine years since Brown was released, and he's still trying to find stable ground. He has struggled with addiction and depression. He cycles through phones. He has lost his Social Security card so many times the federal government will no longer replace it. The dreams he had for himself when he was in prison - that he would go to college, that he would help his daughter to rise above the poverty that had plagued his own childhood - have slipped so far out of his reach he can hardly allow himself to believe in them. Still, he knows how exceptional his case is.\n\n\"They have a lot of guys in prison that are filing claims,\" he told me. \"They're not all saying, 'I didn't do this.' They're just saying, 'The way you sentenced me is wrong. The crime doesn't warrant all this time you gave me.' But they can't come home, because once they get you, they got you, and the courts - they're not listening. They don't see you.\"\n\nFor this story, ProPublica reviewed thousands of pages of documents, examined the cases of more than 450 prisoners, and interviewed several dozen people, many of whom had never before spoken publicly about these events.\n\nRichard A.

In court filings, police say he took a bus from Detroit to Toledo \"without a valid reason.\" Six young black men were arrested in Toledo last Saturday while hanging out on a front lawn; police allege they were \"seen standing within 6 feet of each other.\" In Cincinnati, a black man was charged with violating stay-at-home orders after he was shot in the ankle on April 7; according to a police affidavit, he was talking to a friend in the street when he was shot and was \"clearly not engaged in essential activities.\"\n\nOhio's health director, Dr. Amy Acton, issued the state's stay-at-home order on March 22, prohibiting people from leaving their home except for essential activities and requiring them to maintain social distancing \"at all times.\" A violation of the order is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $750 fine. Since the order, hundreds of people have been charged with violations across Ohio.\n\nThe state has also seen some of the most prominent protests against state stay-at-home orders, as large crowds gather on the statehouse steps to flout the directives. But the protesters, most of them white, have not faced arrest. Rather, in three large Ohio jurisdictions ProPublica examined, charges of violating the order appear to have fallen disproportionately on black people.\n\nProPublica analyzed court records for the city of Toledo and for the counties that include Columbus and Cincinnati, three of the most populous jurisdictions in Ohio. In all of them, ProPublica found, black people were at least four times as likely to be charged with violating the stay-at-home order as white people.\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we're on track.\n\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\nAs states across the country attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19, stay-at-home orders have proven instrumental in the fight against the novel coronavirus; experts credit aggressive restrictions with flattening the curve in the nation's hotbeds. Many states' orders carry criminal penalties for violations of the stay-at-home mandates. But as the weather warms up and people spend more time outside, defense lawyers and criminal justice reform advocates fear that black communities long subjected to overly aggressive policing will face similarly aggressive enforcement of stay-at-home mandates.\n\nIn Ohio, ProPublica found, the disparities are already pronounced.\n\nAs of Thursday night in Hamilton County, which is 27% black and home to Cincinnati, there were 107 charges for violating the order; 61% of defendants are black. The majority of arrests came from towns surrounding Cincinnati, which is 43% black. Of the 29 people charged by the city's Police Department, 79% were black, according to data provided to ProPublica by the Hamilton County Public Defender.\n\nIn Toledo, where black people make up 27% of the population, 18 of the 23 people charged thus far were black.\n\nLt. Kellie Lenhardt, a spokeswoman for the Toledo Police Department, said that in enforcing the stay-at-home order, the department's goal is not to arrest people and that officers are primarily responding to calls from people complaining about violations of the order. She told ProPublica that if the police arrested someone, the officers believed they had probable cause, and that while biased policing would be \"wrong,\" it would also be wrong to arrest more white people simply \"to balance the numbers.\"\n\nIn Franklin County, which is 23.5% black, 129 people were arrested between the beginning of the stay-at-home order and May 4; 57% of the people arrested were black.\n\nIn Cleveland, which is 50% black and is the state's second-largest city, the Municipal Court's public records do not include race data. The court and the Cleveland Police Department were unable to readily provide demographic information about arrests to ProPublica, though on Friday, the police said they have issued eight charges so far.\n\nIn the three jurisdictions, about half of those charged with violating the order were also charged with other offenses, such as drug possession and disorderly conduct. The rest were charged only with violating the order; among that group, the percentage of defendants who were black was even higher.\n\nFranklin Country is home to Columbus, where enforcement of the stay-at-home order has made national headlines for a very different reason. Columbus is the state capital and Ohio's largest city with a population of almost 900,000. In recent weeks, groups of mostly white protesters have campaigned against the stay-at-home order on the Statehouse steps and outside the health director's home. Some protesters have come armed, and images have circulated of crowds of demonstrators huddled close, chanting, many without masks.\n\nNo protesters have been arrested for violating the stay-at-home order, a spokesperson for the Columbus mayor's office told ProPublica. Thomas Hach, an organizer of a group called Free Ohio Now, said in an email that he was not aware of any arrests associated with protests in the entire state. The Columbus Division of Police did not respond to ProPublica's request for comment.\n\nOhio legislators are contemplating reducing the criminal penalties for violating the order. On Wednesday, the state House passed legislation that would eliminate the possibility of jail time for stay-at-home violators. A first offense would result in a warning, and further violations would result in a small fine. The bill is pending in the state Senate.\n\nPenalties for violating stay-at-home orders vary across the country. In many states, including California, Florida, Michigan and Washington, violations can land someone behind bars. In New York state, violations can only result in fines. In Baltimore, police told local media they had only charged two people with violations; police have reportedly relied on a recording played over the loudspeakers of squad cars: \"Even if you aren't showing symptoms, you could still have coronavirus and accidentally spread it to a relative or neighbor. Being home is being safe. We are all in this together.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nEnforcement has often resulted in controversy. In New York City, a viral video showed police pull out a Taser and punch a black man after they approached a group of people who weren't wearing masks. Police say the man who was punched took a \"fighting stance\" when ordered to disperse. In Orlando, police arrested a homeless man walking a bicycle because he was not obeying curfew. In Hawaii, charges against a man accused of stealing a car battery, normally a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail, were enhanced to a felony, which can result in 10 years in prison, because police and prosecutors said he was in violation of the state order.\n\nThe orders are generally broad, and decisions about which violations to treat as acceptable and which ones to penalize have largely been left to local police departments' discretion.\n\nKristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a legal organization focused on racial justice, said such discretion has opened the door to police abuse, and she said the U.S. Department of Justice or state governments should issue detailed guidelines about when to make arrests. That discretion \"is what's given rise to these rogue practices,\" she told ProPublica, \"that are putting black communities and communities of color with a target on their backs.\"\n\nIn jails and prisons around the country, inmates have fallen ill or died from COVID-19 as the virus spreads rapidly through the facilities. Many local governments have released some inmates from jail and ordered police to reduce arrests for minor crimes. But in Hamilton County, some people charged with failing to maintain social distancing have been kept in jail for at least one night, even without any other charges. Recently, two sheriff's deputies who work in the jail tested positive for COVID-19. \"The cops put their hands on them, they cram them in the car, they take them to the [jail], which has 800 to 1400 people, depending on the night,\" said Sean Vicente, director of the Hamilton County Public Defender's misdemeanor division. \"It's often so crowded everyone's just sitting on the floor.\"\n\nClarke said the enforcement push is sometimes undercutting the public health effort: \"Protecting people's health is in direct conflict with putting people in overcrowded jails and prisons that have been hotbeds for the virus.\"\n\nCorrectional officers, health care staff and detainees describe how COVID-19 spread through Cook County Jail in Chicago as the sheriff came under fire for his handling of the crisis. \"You're working in a petri dish,\" one staffer said.\n\nCourt records show that the Cincinnati Police Department has adopted some surprising applications of the law.\n\nSix people were charged with violations of the order after they were shot. Only one was charged with another crime as well, but police affidavits state that when they were shot, they were or likely were in violation of the order. One man was shot in the ankle while talking to a friend, according to court filings, and \"was clearly not engaged in essential activities.\" Another was arrested with the same explanation; police wrote that he had gone to the hospital with a gunshot wound. The Cincinnati Police Department did not respond to ProPublica's requests for comment.\n\nIn Springfield Township, a small, mostly white Cincinnati suburb, nine people have been arrested for violating the order thus far. All of them are black.\n\nSpringfield Township Police Chief Robert Browder told ProPublica in an email that the department is \"an internationally accredited law enforcement organization\" and has \"strict policies ... to ensure that our zero tolerance policy prohibiting bias-based profiling is adhered to.\"\n\nBrowder said race had not played a role in his department's enforcement of the order and that he was \"appalled if that is the insinuation.\"\n\nSeveral of the black people arrested in Springfield Township were working for a company that sells books and magazine subscriptions door to door. One of the workers, Carl Brown, 50, said he and five colleagues were working in Springfield Township when two members of the team were arrested while going door to door. Police called the other sales people, and when they arrived at the scene, they too were arrested. Five of them, including Brown, were charged only with violating the stay-at-home order; the sixth sales person had an arrest warrant in another state, according to Browder, and police also charged her for giving them false identification.\n\nBrown said one of the officers had left the group with a warning: They should never come back, and if they do, it's \"going to be worse.\"\n\nBrowder denied that the officers made such a threat, and he said the police had received calls from residents about the sales people and their tactics and that the sales people had failed to register with the Police Department, as required for door-to-door solicitation.\n\nOther violations in Hamilton County have been more egregious, but even in some of those cases, the law enforcement response has stirred controversy. On April 4, a man who had streamed a party on Facebook Live, saying, \"We don't give a fuck about this coronavirus,\" was arrested in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, the setting of a 2001 riot after police fatally shot an unarmed black man.\n\nThe man who streamed the party, Rashaan Davis, was charged with violating the stay-at-home order and inciting violence, and his bond was set at $350,000.\n\nAfter Judge Alan Triggs said he would release Davis from jail pretrial because the offense charged was nonviolent, local media reported , prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor and said they would focus on the charge of inciting violence, a felony.\n\nThe Hamilton County prosecutor's office declined to comment on Davis' case.\n\nIn Toledo, there's been public controversy around perceived differences in the application of the law. On April 21, debate at the Toledo City Council meeting centered around a food truck. Local politicians discussed recent arrests of young black people at house parties, some contrasting them with a large, white crowd standing close together in line outside a BBQ stand, undisturbed by police. Councilmember Gary Johnson told ProPublica he's asked the police chief to investigate why no one was arrested at a party he'd heard about, where white people were congregating on docks. \"I don't know the circumstances of the arrests,\" he said. But \"if you feel you need to go into poor neighborhoods and African American neighborhoods, you better be going into white neighborhoods too. ... You have to say we're going to be heavy-handed with the stay-at-home order or we're going to be light with it. It has to be one or the other.\"\n\nToledo police enforcement has not been confined to partygoers. Armani Thomas, 20, is one of the six young men arrested for not social distancing on a lawn. He told ProPublica he was sitting there with nine friends \"doing nothing\" when the police pulled up. Two kids ran off, and the police made the rest stay, eventually arresting \"all the dudes\" and letting the girls go. He was taken to the county jail, where several inmates have tested positive, for booking and released after several hours. The men's cases are pending.\n\n\"When police see black people gathered in public, I think there's this looming belief that they must be doing something illegal,\" RaShya Ghee, a criminal defense attorney and lecturer at the University of Toledo, told ProPublica. \"They're hanging out in a yard - something illegal must have happened. Or, something illegal is about to happen.\"\n\nLenhardt, the police lieutenant, said the six men were arrested after police received 911 calls reporting \"a group gathering and flashing guns.\" None of the six men were arrested on gun charges. As for the 19-year-old charged for taking the bus without reason, she said police asked him on consecutive days to not loiter at a bus station.\n\nWith more than 70,000 Americans dead from the coronavirus, government officials have not figured out how to balance the threat of COVID-19 with the harms of over policing, Clarke said. \"On the one hand, we want to beat back the pandemic. That's critical. That's the end goal,\" she told ProPublica. \"On the other hand, we're seeing social distancing being used as a pretext to arrest the very communities that have been hit hardest by the virus.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nA ProPublica analysis of killings by police shows outsize risk for young black males.\n\nby Ryan Gabrielson , Eric Sagara and Ryann Grochowski Jones\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nYoung black males in recent years were at a far greater risk of being shot dead by police than their white counterparts - 21 times greater i , according to a ProPublica analysis of federally collected data on fatal police shootings.\n\nThe 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks, age 15 to 19, were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million, while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police.\n\nOne way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica's analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring - 185, more than one per week.\n\nProPublica's risk analysis on young males killed by police certainly seems to support what has been an article of faith in the African American community for decades: Blacks are being killed at disturbing rates when set against the rest of the American population.\n\nOur examination involved detailed accounts of more than 12,000 police homicides stretching from 1980 to 2012 contained in the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report. The data, annually self-reported by hundreds of police departments across the country, confirms some assumptions, runs counter to others, and adds nuance to a wide range of questions about the use of deadly police force.\n\nColin Loftin, University at Albany professor and co-director of the Violence Research Group, said the FBI data is a minimum count of homicides by police, and that it is impossible to precisely measure what puts people at risk of homicide by police without more and better records. Still, what the data shows about the race of victims and officers, and the circumstances of killings, are \"certainly relevant,\" Loftin said.\n\n\"No question, there are all kinds of racial disparities across our criminal justice system,\" he said. \"This is one example.\"\n\nThe FBI's data has appeared in news accounts over the years, and surfaced again with the August killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. To a great degree, observers and experts lamented the limited nature of the FBI's reports. Their shortcomings are inarguable.\n\nThe data, for instance, is terribly incomplete. Vast numbers of the country's 17,000 police departments don't file fatal police shooting reports at all, and many have filed reports for some years but not others. Florida departments haven't filed reports since 1997 and New York City last reported in 2007. Information contained in the individual reports can also be flawed. Still, lots of the reporting police departments are in larger cities, and at least 1000 police departments filed a report or reports over the 33 years.\n\nThere is, then, value in what the data can show while accepting, and accounting for, its limitations. Indeed, while the absolute numbers are problematic, a comparison between white and black victims shows important trends. Our analysis included dividing the number of people of each race killed by police by the number of people of that race living in the country at the time, to produce two different rates: the risk of getting killed by police if you are white and if you are black.\n\nDavid Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and expert on police use of deadly force, said racial disparities in the data could result from \"measurement error,\" meaning that the unreported killings could alter ProPublica's findings.\n\nHowever, he said the disparity between black and white teenage boys is so wide, \"I doubt the measurement error would account for that.\"\n\nProPublica spent weeks digging into the many rich categories of information the reports hold: the race of the officers involved; the circumstances cited for the use of deadly force; the age of those killed.\n\nWho Gets Killed?\n\nThe finding that young black men are 21 times as likely as their white peers to be killed by police is drawn from reports filed for the years 2010 to 2012, the three most recent years for which FBI numbers are available.\n\nThe black boys killed can be disturbingly young. There were 41 teens 14 years or younger reported killed by police from 1980 to 2012 ii . 27 of them were black iii ; 8 were white iv ; 4 were Hispanic v and 1 was Asian vi .\n\nThat's not to say officers weren't killing white people. Indeed, some 44 percent of all those killed by police across the 33 years were white.\n\nWhite or black, though, those slain by police tended to be roughly the same age. The average age of blacks killed by police was 30 . The average age of whites was 35 .\n\nWho is killing all those black men and boys?\n\nMostly white officers. But in hundreds of instances, black officers, too. Black officers account for a little more than 10 percent of all fatal police shootings. Of those they kill, though, 78 percent were black.\n\nWhite officers, given their great numbers in so many of the country's police departments, are well represented in all categories of police killings. White officers killed 91 percent of the whites who died at the hands of police. And they were responsible for 68 percent of the people of color killed. Those people of color represented 46 percent of all those killed by white officers.\n\nWhat were the circumstances surrounding all these fatal encounters?\n\nThere were 151 instances in which police noted that teens they had shot dead had been fleeing or resisting arrest at the time of the encounter. 67 percent of those killed in such circumstances were black. That disparity was even starker in the last couple of years: of the 15 teens shot fleeing arrest from 2010 to 2012, 14 were black.\n\nDid police always list the circumstances of the killings? No, actually, there were many deadly shooting where the circumstances were listed as \"undetermined.\" 77 percent of those killed in such instances were black.\n\nCertainly, there were instances where police truly feared for their lives.\n\nOf course, although the data show that police reported that as the cause of their actions in far greater numbers after the 1985 Supreme Court decision that said police could only justify using deadly force if the suspects posed a threat to the officer or others. From 1980 to 1984, \"officer under attack\" was listed as the cause for 33 percent of the deadly shootings. Twenty years later, looking at data from 2005 to 2009, \"officer under attack\" was cited in 62 percent xxxvii of police killings.\n\nDoes the data include cases where police killed people with something other than a standard service handgun?\n\nYes, and the Los Angeles Police Department stood out in its use of shotguns. Most police killings involve officers firing handguns xl . But from 1980 to 2012 , 714 involved the use of a shotgun xli . The Los Angeles Police Department has a special claim on that category. It accounted for 47 cases xlii in which an officer used a shotgun. The next highest total came from the Dallas Police Department: 14 xliii .\n\nFor more civil rights coverage, read Segregation Now, the resegregation of America's schools , and Living Apart, how the government beytrayed a landmark civil rights law .\n\nUpdate (Dec. 23, 2014) : ProPublica shared its findings and methodology with Prof. David Klinger before this story appeared. In two interviews with reporters, he noted that the FBI data has serious shortcomings . But he also said the disparity ProPublica had found between black and white victims was so large, it was unlikely to have resulted solely from omissions in the FBI statistics.  After the story appeared, Klinger said flaws in the FBI data made it unusable . ProPublica contacted Klinger and asked him to elaborate, but he declined to comment further.  We stand by the analysis. A full response to the arguments Klinger and another critic have raised is here .\n\ni ProPublica calculated a statistical figure called a risk ratio by dividing the rate of black homicide victims by the rate of white victims. This ratio, commonly used in epidemiology, gives an estimate for how much more at risk black teenagers were to be killed by police officers.Risk ratios can have varying levels of precision, depending on a variety of mathematical factors. In this case, because such shootings are rare from a statistical perspective, a 95 percent confidence interval indicates that black teenagers are at between 10 and 40 times greater risk of being killed by a police officer. The calculation used 2010-2012 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.\n\nii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179431\n\niii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179432\n\niv https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179433\n\nv https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179434\n\nvi https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179435\n\nxxxvii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307298-circumstances-yearcats-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179463\n\nxl Calculated from the \"Weapon Used by Offender\" variable.

      "text": "âThey see strengthâ: The Black sports icons shaping Donald Trumpâs take on race, politics, and masculinity\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FloridaÂ â The road to understanding Donald Trumpâs appeal to a segment of Black America âÂ and his hopes of winning back the presidency by pulling a few precious votes away from Democrats â runs through Trumpâs Black friends, a loose set of iconic sports figures from the 1980s.\n\nThat, at least, was the impression I got from his campaign when I set out to interview Trump about his apparent gains with Black men, a group of voters who some public polls show are more likely to consider backing him this year. Trumpâs aides wouldnât promise a meeting with the former president just yet âÂ instead, they started setting up interviews with older athletes who are supporting his campaign.\n\nNot long after, I got a call from Mets and Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry. That was the beginning of an odyssey through the heroes and villains of my childhood: Over the next few weeks, I chatted with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stood backstage at a Trump rally with retired NFL star Lawrence Taylor, and traveled to meet boxing promoter Don King in person. Eventually, I talked to Trump himself.\n\nThese men, now aged 57 to 92, would make unlikely spokespeople for almost any other candidate and they mostly arenât known for their politics. But they do have a lot in common with Trump. They were household names at the same time as Trumpâs New York heyday. They were frequently in the tabloids, often for the wrong reasons, and it took a push from the campaign to persuade some of them to talk to a strange reporter. Nearly all of them had faced serious legal issues, including several criminal convictions.\n\nI met Trump six days after his own felony conviction, in the âGreat Roomâ at Mar-a-Lago. He had just finished a sit-down with Dr. Phil. I asked him, among other things, what I should take away from his warm relationship with the Black men who had been singing his praises to me.\n\nâThey see what Iâve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,â he said. âThey want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They donât want to have millions of people come and take their jobs. And we â thatâs whatâs happening. These people that are coming into our country are taking jobs away from African Americans and they know it.â\n\nI reminded him I was talking about millionaires, not working stiffs worried about immigrant labor. He conceded, jokingly, that Don King was not at risk of being replaced.\n\nTheir relationships came up more directly after my next question, when I asked how he responds to Black voters who call him racist.\n\nâI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldnât be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,â he told me. âThey would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist â and Iâm not racist!â\n\nWeâll find out in November if Trump wins this argument. He lost Black voters by a 92-8 margin in his last election, according to a Pew Research study , despite high hopes for a breakthrough that cycle. In 2016, he settled for boasting that fewer Black voters had showed up to the polls that year, which he said wasÂ âalmost as goodâ as their support.\n\nBut while he hasnât succeeded yet, Trump was getting at something noteworthy in our conversation. A common obstacle to outreach for Republican politicians is that theyâre often from cloistered, white spaces where they donât have many interactions with Black people. Thatâs not Trumpâs issue: Heâs had famous âBlack friends,â as they say, throughout his career, even as he was constantly dogged by accusations of racism at the same time. The people I spoke to werenât passing acquaintances, either. They had made deals together, weathered crises together, and shared family gatherings together. One had even chaperoned Don Jr. on a trip to Disney World.\n\nAnd while a handful of aging Reagan-era celebrities obviously arenât a stand-in for all Black people, and especially the rank-and-file voters who actually decide elections, they do represent a recognizable part of Black culture that Trump has long been plugged into. His success in the election may partly depend on whether, in this shifting cultural moment, there are enough Americans thinking about the election the way Mike Tyson does.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs aides seemed to think I might understand their candidate because I was shaped by the same New York era. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s at the nexus of these two Black Americas, where ordinary folks and celebrities meet. When I was in my early twenties, I worked at Dooney & Bourke in Trump Tower, selling leather handbags to tourists. I knew Tyson as a global icon, but also as the local bigshot who ran in the same circles as my childhood friendsâ older siblings.\n\nAnd so a couple of weeks after I pitched the campaign an interview, I was in Wildwood, New Jersey talking to Taylor and his old Giants teammate Ottis âOJâ Anderson at a Trump rally. Taylorâs case for Trump was one Iâd heard from voters many, many times before.\n\nâHeâs going to speak his mind,â he told me. âHe doesnât care how it comes out.â\n\nHe added, crucially: âHeâs a manâs man.â\n\nTaylor, like all of the names I had been put in touch with, had a business relationship with Trump at some point as well as a social one. He recalled meeting Trump when he tried to poach him as part of a failed football venture that briefly competed with the NFL. âHe put a million dollars in my account and said, listen, he wants me to play â and weâve been friends ever since,â he said.\n\nAt the time of that rally, Trump was still on trial in a Manhattan court over hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of his first election; he faces three more pending criminal trials in state and federal courts. It was a problem his friends could relate to.\n\nTaylor, who was plagued by off-field issues throughout his Hall-of-Fame playing career, pleaded guilty in 2011 to patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute. (He said he believed she was 19). Trump stood by Tyson in the 1990s while he was jailed on a rape charge that he denied (he also was hosting his fights , which required the boxer to be out of jail). In 2016, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus reportedly intervened to keep King off the 2016 convention stage because of his prior manslaughter conviction.\n\nâThe party could not associate itself with someone convicted of a felony,â the New York Times noted at the time, which might as well have been a thousand years ago.\n\nStrawberry came out the other side of drug addiction and jail to become an evangelical preacher. When I spoke to him, he mentioned that he and other sports stars know what itâs like to face the burning gaze of the public, something he connected to support for Trump.\n\nâPeople are hoping that he comes back, a lot of athletes,â Strawberry said. âA lot of times people are afraid to say â theyâre afraid of public opinion, and Iâve had public opinion my whole lifeâ¦they were saying I couldnât survive, I couldnât make it. And guess what? Iâm still here.â\n\nTrumpâs gains with nonwhite voters in the polls have mostly come from younger Americans . When I mentioned to Trump during our interview that the people that Iâd been directed to talk to all seemed to be associated with a certain bygone period, he immediately thought to add another name to the list.\n\nâDid you give her Herschel?â he asked his staff.\n\nHe was referring to Herschel Walker, the former football star who lost his Senate race last cycle while facing political attacks over allegations of past domestic abuse and previously unacknowledged children. A born-again Christian, Walker told voters at the time that he had moved past a dark period of mental illness and was reformed.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from Walker, who adores Trump. He recalled how they became close in the 1980s, when he was also involved in Trumpâs football endeavors. Walker volunteered to take a young Don Jr. to Disney World with his own family while his team was at training camp in Orlando. The ease with which a white New York businessman befriended âa Black kid who came from this little town with absolutely nothing,â made a strong impression.\n\nâI know the man has got a great heart,â he said.\n\nWalker rejected the premise that Trump had a problem with Black voters âÂ he said he was sick of being asked to âdefendâ him as a Black man, as if supporting Trump required an extraordinary explanation. His advice to the campaign was to start showing up more often in Black neighborhoods and to treat voters the same as they would white voters.\n\nâWhat I told Don is I think you need to go see more Black people in the cities and talk to them,â he said. âI said, you know, they love you.â\n\nThereâs a reason I keep mentioning the shared legal problems of Trump and his friends: Itâs become inextricable from any discussion of his outreach to Black voters.\n\nBefore his Manhattan trial, Trump had taken to comparing his personal legal struggles to those Black men face in the criminal justice system. At one point in February, he boasted that âthe Black populationâ loved seeing his mugshot in Fulton County, Georgia where he faces separate criminal charges over election interference. He has repeatedly compared himself to Nelson Mandela, the late South African president who spent decades as a political prisoner while opposing apartheid.\n\nDemocrats have accused him of reinforcing ugly stereotypes for his personal benefit. When I asked him about the topic, he said it wouldnât be part of his pitch to Black voters â but also couldnât help making the comparison again.\n\nâNo, it wonât be part of my message,â Trump said. âI think itâs through osmosis. They see whatâs happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, theyâve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see whatâs happened to them.â\n\nBlack conservatives arenât always happy about this kind of talk either. Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist, said she broached the topic with Trump at a dinner he hosted with HBCU students on the night of our interview. âDonât put that out there that Black people like you because youâre a felon,â she told me she said to Trump. âThe Black people donât like you because youâre a felon. The Black people who like you like you because they feel like youâre experiencing the things that they have been complaining about for years, and now maybe you can shine a light on the cries that have been falling on deaf ears for all of this time.â\n\nIt might make some people cringe, but itâs easier to understand where Trump gets the impression this is a relatable message when youâre spending time with his famous friends.\n\nâIf I never saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was Black,â Tyson told me. âThe way they were treating him in the papers and in the press? Think about that, the way they treat him in court? Thatâs the way they did Black people.â\n\nKing once said Trump understood Black people ââbecause âno matter what you say or do, you are guilty as hell.â The same week we spoke, rapper 50 Cent said during a Capitol visit that Black men identify with Trump âbecause they got RICO charges,â a reference to the statute being used to prosecute Trump in Georgia.\n\nâLook at what happened to a lot of the people of color and right now the injustice that is happening with Donald,â Walker told me. âRight now, itâs almost just âÂ itâs almost similar to that.â\n\nOf course, the question looming over this and every prior Trump campaign has been whether a few wealthy entertainers and athletes are representative of voters writ large. Thatâs especially true when theyâve faced their own accusations in the public eye that might make them uniquely inclined towards defending Trump.\n\nThereâs at least some early evidence Trump has misread the room in this regard: A poll by Democratic firm Navigator Research found Black voters were the group most likely to think Trump was guilty in the Manhattan case, by a 76-15 margin. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn also noted that their own post-verdict polling showed President Biden shoring up support with younger, politically disengaged, nonwhite voters âÂ the exact group Trump is targeting.\n\nDemocrats have watched Trumpâs polling rise with a mix of shock, anger, and disbelief. He has a long history of remarks that were widely condemned as racist and feuded as president with Black lawmakers like civil rights icon John Lewis , whose district he blasted as âcrime-infestedâ and who he continued to grouse about after his death. Who, they ask, is buying this?\n\nâHeâs trying to lean into his identity, Donald Trumpâs identity, as a criminal, because heâs now a convicted felon,â Rep. Steven Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told me. âItâs not a policy agenda that improves the lives of anyone, much less Black Americans. And not only is it an insult, it is an affront to Black men and Black people and what it is we are fighting forâ\n\nHorsford, who has been holding a tour of Black barbershops in his Las Vegas-area district, described Trumpâs campaign as âa bunch of platitudes with no actual policy or commitment behind them.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has taken Trumpâs polling gains seriously, though. In high-profile campaign speeches, ads, and statements, theyâve tried to remind voters âÂ and especially younger voters âÂ of his history of inflammatory statements and accusations of discrimination .\n\nâDonald Trump has spent his life and political career disrespecting Black men every chance he gets: he entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder, denigrated George Floydâs memory, and launched his political career trying to undermine the first Black president as the architect of birtherism,â Senior Biden Spokesperson Sarafina Chitikatold Semafor.\n\nVoters in their twenties today were children when Trump was leading his false birther charge against Barack Obama, a lengthy public crusade to prove that the first Black president was secretly born in Kenya and that his Ivy League pedigree at Columbia and Harvard Law School was nothing more than affirmative action. He dropped the issue just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nI brought the topic up with Trump in passing; he responded only in generalities about his broader record on issues like HBCU funding. But even some of his friends were stung by that one. Tyson told me he âdidnât agreeâ with Trumpâs Obama-bashing at the time, though he added he didnât let it affect their relationship. Walker chalked it up as âpart of this politics thing.â\n\nDemocrats are also hoping to capture the energy of four years ago, when the nation was engaged in large-scale protests against police brutality and racial inequality, a movement that notably also had broad buy-in from Black athletes in the major sports leagues. Trump condemned the Black Lives Matter movement in his debates with Biden and staged a photo-op outside the White House after riot police tear-gassed Lafayette Square. More recently, he bragged in a Time interview about how he had threatened protestors who âdesecratedâ monuments with 10-year minimum sentences.\n\nThen thereâs the âCentral Park Five,â a group of teenagers who were arrested in 1989 and charged with the rape of a jogger, prompting Trump to take out an ad calling to reinstate the death penalty. They were later exonerated âÂ one recently became a New York City Council member âÂ but Trump has never acknowledged their innocence. Their story is featured in Bidenâs campaign ads .\n\nWhen I spoke to Tyson, he said the topic still comes up when he tries to sell fellow celebrities on Trump.\n\nâThe only thing they can say is that heâs a racist,â he said. âCentral Park Five, other than that, they canât bring up anything else. And most of those famous Black people, they werenât saying that when he was getting them free tickets at the fight and getting them free rooms at the fight âÂ they werenât saying he was a racist then.â\n\nThat Trump is generous to his friends is part of the Democratsâ message, too. Theyâre arguing the former presidentâs sudden interest in discrimination as a smokescreen: Itâs not that he wants a more just legal system, itâs that he wants to abuse the law in order to protect himself, reward his allies, and punish his enemies.\n\nâWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?â Biden said at a Philadelphia event aimed at Black voters in May. âI donât think heâd be talking about pardons.â\n\nTrump has made tough talk on crime central to his campaign. But he also appealed to Black voters in 2020 by touting his work on the First Step Act, the most significant criminal justice reform package in years, and he boasted about granting clemency and pardons to some nonviolent drug offenders .\n\nThe politics of that movement have changed significantly since then. Following a crime surge in his final year in office, Trump began talking less about freeing prisoners on old drug charges, and more about executing drug dealers . A number of Trumpâs Republican primary challengers criticized the First Step Act and even suggested repealing it.\n\nSo I was at least somewhat surprised to hear Trump still sounded largely like it was 2020 when I raised these topics.\n\nâPeople have been treated very unfairly and itâs largely Black people,â he said. âItâs Hispanic people, itâs not just Black.â\n\nIn fact, he talked about expanding the First Step Act âÂ though itâs not clear how, and Trump has a history of promising policy rollouts that are always right around the corner.\n\nâWeâre going to be doing extensions of that,â he told me, adding that heâd release amendments for âstrengthening certain thingsâ while âworking on fairness.â\n\nIn some corners of the right, like Tucker Carlsonâs online show, thereâs been a renewed effort to defend Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota cop who killed George Floyd and is currently in jail for murder. Trump has pledged to âindemnify all police officers and law enforcement officialsâ if heâs re-elected, touching on a longstanding debate about whether police officers should be held personally responsible for their professional actions.\n\nHe has not elaborated on how broadly this policy should be applied, nor is it clear he has much ability to influence these cases at all. But he did tell me he believed Chauvin should not have been shielded from prosecution.\n\nâNo. What he did was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. That was crazy. When I looked at that â I watched that tape many times, no,â he said. âBut they have a lot of people that did a good job, and they were innocent. And you know, theyâve lost everything. Theyâve lost everything.â\n\nâSay hello to Don âÂ I love Don King,â Trump told me before we parted. âHeâs unbelievable. This guy was unique. There was never anybody like Don King.â\n\nAnd so after my visit to Mar-a-Lago, my nostalgia tour took me 45 miles south to Hollywood, Florida, where King was promoting his Fist of Fury boxing event.\n\nWhen I arrived for the weigh-in, King, 92 years old, was slumped in a wheelchair, though still strikingly tall. The light wasnât in his eyes like it used to be, but he could still pull off a look âÂ he was wearing one of his signature rhinestone denim jackets with an American flag design that heâs been photographed in many times before. With the assistance of his two grandsons, he was able to get on stage and stand just long enough to pose between boxers during their staredowns.\n\nKing wasnât in the mood to chat much, but his niece was there to help him get around. A self-described â Republicrat ,â he enthusiastically backed Trump in his prior campaigns and Jean King Battle told me her uncle has a lifesize cutout of Trump in their family room âbecause heâs family to my uncle.â When I approached him the next day, he seemed unaware we were scheduled to talk.\n\nBut Trump was right about one thing: The place had strong MAGA vibes and they were feeding off the testosterone in the room.\n\nâThatâs my nâa,â boxer Adrien Broner, 34, said when Trump was mentioned at the weigh-in. When I asked him to elaborate, he said, âTrumpâs the man. When Trump was in office, everybody was eating.â Dressed in a taxi-yellow sweatsuit with âWORK OR DIEâ on the back he added, âHeâs a man that means business. Just like me.â\n\nA promoter at the event, Egypt Brown, characterized Trumpâs allure in the boxing world as rooted in masculinity. âThey donât connect with Pride month as a fighter,â Brown told me. âThey donât connect with women fighting with men in their sport because itâs all about competition.â\n\nIâd heard similar things in Philadelphia just days earlier, when Republican Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt hosted a â Congress, Cognac, and Cigars â gathering at a smoking lounge to discuss Black male politics. Democratsâ emphasis on LGBTQ issues was helping drive Black voters to Republicans, Donalds said, while an audience member complained to me that feminism was leaving Black men behind.\n\nâThey intentionally promote the Black woman so she can look down on the Black man,â said Michael Blackwell, 60. âSo not only is society looking down at us, now the Black woman is because she got a hundred thousand dollars, got a career. Sheâs been conditioned to not need a man.â\n\nMy 1980s road trip through Donald Trumpâs star-studded world may wind up being a sideshow âÂ just another journalistâs half-futile attempt to understand the direction of the American public. Or it may be a kind of early warning system of something deeper.\n\nLeaders across the political spectrum are scrambling to channel the shifting politics of gender and a sense that men, in particular, have become alienated from the political system. Republicans have long argued that Black voters are more socially conservative than their vote indicates; their hope is that making elections a referendum on traditional masculinity will find a receptive audience.\n\nA big question is whether Trump has an operation ready to capitalize on his polling: The Biden campaign pointed to the newly revamped RNCâs struggles to nail their own program, including an initial decision to close minority outreach centers.\n\nTrumpâs effort is still in its early stages and has been stymied by a lack of direction, with no dedicated lead for ethnic and faith-based outreach. The campaign tapped Gina Carr to focus on Black outreach around the time of his South Bronx rally last month, which was touted as a show of his dedication to reaching nonwhite voters. But itâs still not clear the level of resources or scheduling the campaign plans to roll out, or whether it might release a targeted policy platform for Black Americans like 2020âs â Platinum Plan .â Lynne Patton, his senior advisor, said in a statement that his âpledge to Black Americansâ would be to âreinstateâ his old policies on issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nBut no one should assume Black voters are permanently immune to the kinds of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters âÂ that Trumpâs business success translates to success overseeing an economy, or that his personal problems equate to their personal problems, or that his distrust of the âdeep stateâ echoes their suspicions about government or media or corporations. Trump would hardly be the first candidate to try to beat an unpopular incumbent by feeding votersâ frustrations, avoiding policy specifics, and asking them to project their hopes on him.\n\nI asked Tyson about his interactions with ordinary people when it comes to Trump. He told me fans he meets are skeptical, but that his relationship with the former president makes them curious if theyâre missing something.\n\nâStreet people, they say âYo, I donât fâ with your man [Trump], but he loves you,ââ he said. âThey want to meet him. They ask me âwhat is he like?ââ\n\nAnd what does he tell them?\n\nâHeâs a people person,â he said. âThe common people voted him into office. It wasnât no big shot that voted him in office.â\n\nNot everyone buys the premise that Trumpâs gains with Black voters in polls will translate to the real world. While he has some concerns about younger voters, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher told me that about 14% of Black men have typically voted Republican in non-Obama cycles and heâs seen little in his own polling of likely voters âÂ and especially in recent election results â to indicate this will change in a major way.\n\nâ[There] is literally no evidence in actual voting that Black voters, including Black men, are somehow historically breaking Republican,â Belcher said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "What Trumpâs Black outreach looks like in Philly\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPHILADELPHIA â About a hundred Trump supporters, overwhelmingly Black men, gathered at The Cigar Code on Tuesday evening in North Philadelphia, filing into a smoke-filled room with tufted sofas for an informal chat with Reps. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, about the pivotal role they have to play in the election.\n\nâPennsylvaniaâs a swing state,â Hunt told Semafor. âItâs one of the most important states in this entire election. And so what we know is we could carve out between 25% and 30% of the Black male voters in Pennsylvania. What weâre trying to do is actually go fish where the fish are.â\n\nThe âCongress, Cognac, and Cigarsâ conversation, moderated by sports reporter Michele Tafoya, was tied to a kickoff event by the Trump campaign the same day it opened its first office in the city. President Biden has paid special attention to Philadelphia throughout his presidency and visited the previous week with Vice President Kamala Harris to warn Black voters that Trump was âpeddling lies and stereotypes for your votes so he can win for himself, not for you.â\n\nPolling has shown Republicans have a significant opportunity to make gains with Black voters this cycle, but thereâs also skepticism of their partyâs ability to capitalize on it, especially after an uneven start to the RNCâs outreach operation. Donalds and Hunt were trying to show what a targeted, on-the-ground strategy might look like âÂ perhaps proof of concept for a larger effort.\n\nâIt has not been a focus of our consultants,â Donalds told the group when Tafoya asked why Republicans struggle to reach Black communities. âYou know, theyâve not thought that they could get Black votes, or that it would take too many campaign resources to get Black votes.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThose who showed up to the event mostly cited inflation as their top concern, the topic Republicans have leaned on hardest along with immigration. But some also pointed to social issues.\n\nâDemocrats have a vicious plan: LGBTQ,â Michael Blackwell, 60, said. âTrump will stop that shit. Iâve got nothing against it, but itâs going too far.â\n\nOne activist referenced the White Houseâs acknowledgment of Transgender Day of Visibility, which has a fixed March 31 date that fell on Easter this year, generating false accusations that the administration had chosen the timing to overlap with the Christian holiday. The White House also held its traditionally scheduled Easter programming.\n\nâThat struck Christians in the wrong way, especially when you talk about the Black community,â Quenton Jordan of the Black Conservative Federation told Semafor. âMost of them are heavily faith-based, whether thatâs the Christian faith or with the Muslim faith, and so things like that donât sit well.â\n\nWhile the event was billed towards men, some women attended as well: Roslyn Ross Williams, a staffer at a conservative grassroots organization who said she was there in a personal capacity, described becoming disillusioned with the Democratic Party over vaccine mandates.\n\nâI felt like if they could choose to fight for a woman to have a right to choose to abort her child, I should have a right to say what I want in my body,â Williams said.\n\nâItâs no coincidence that Donald Trump, who spent his life discriminating against Black tenants and his career railing against the first Black president, has no Black voter outreach program to speak of,â Biden-Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. âTrump has made it clear how little he thinks of Black men: denigrating George Floyd, calling for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, and reportedly calling a Black finalist on the Apprentice the N-word while doubting that Americans would âbuyâ that a Black man won his show. President Biden knows he has to earn â not ask for â every vote, and thatâs exactly what our campaign is doing from now until November.â\n\nNBC News reported recently on the Biden campaignâs own outreach efforts .\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Trump courts women voters and Harris focuses on men in a gender-divided election\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nThe gender gap has become a defining feature of the US presidential election. Polls show Kamala Harris with a lead among women voters, and Donald Trump leading among men, prompting one pundit to predict it could be a â boys vs girls â election.\n\nWith the election just weeks away, both candidates are trying to stem the growing gender divide tide by explicitly targeting voters they are not as strong with.\n\nTrump took questions at a Fox News town hall in front of an all-female audience in Georgia on Wednesday, while Harris ramped up her outreach to Black men, including through an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show. She is also considering an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan , whose show is especially popular among young men, Reuters reported.\n\nTrumpâs appeal among young men has been well documented through his embrace of podcasters like Theo Von and influencers like Logan Paul. But getting that bloc out to the polls presents a different challenge, as voting rates for young men tend to be lower than those for young women and older men. So Trump is looking to shore up support among women â specifically white women â a group that has shifted slightly toward Harris. He has deployed a team of female surrogates and recently told a crowd of women, âI will be your protector .â Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping the overturning of Roe v. Wade galvanizes women voters against Trump.\n\nHarris issued a slate of policy proposals last week aimed at Black men , a move The Wall Street Journal called a âlast minute S.O.S.â Polling shows Harris is underperforming among Black men compared to Democratsâ showings in 2020 and 2016, and some worry her moves are coming too late in the campaign . But the party has been losing support among Black men since 2012, so the trend âpredates Kamala Harris,â The New York Timesâ Astead Herndon pointed out, even though a strong majority still support the vice president. He also cautioned against the narrative that Black men would be to blame if Harris loses. âWe somewhat risk acting like this is a Black man-specific problem , when itâs not.â\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Why is Jamaal Bowman so angry?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nEarlier this month, Rep. Jamaal Bowman walked outside of the House chamber and barked at reporters with an assignment: Ask Republicans âwhy the hell you wonât do anything to save Americaâs children.â\n\nHe was loud. He was frustrated. And he was in his element.\n\nThe scene ended in a viral confrontation over gun violence between Bowman and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. âCalm down?â he yelled at the Republican member. âChildren are dying!â\n\nIt was only one of several recent confrontational moments that seemed designed to set the internet on fire. There was a robust debate on the steps of the Capitol with Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. over the GOPâs 2024 candidates, which they reprised on CNN on Wednesday night (with clips traveling far and wide online ). Earlier this month in Lower Manhattan, Bowman shouted to reporters that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. âneeds to take her ass back to Washington and do something about gun violenceâ while countering her rally protesting Donald Trumpâs indictment.\n\nBut as Bowman recounted the scene outside of the House chambers with Massie, he focused on someone else.\n\nâThen I saw Hakeem â this is hilarious â like, walk past and kind of just bounce,â he told Semafor, referring to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The implication: The more reserved and cautious Jeffries didnât want anything to do with a high-octane spectacle he might have to comment on.\n\nBowmanâs a former New York City school principal who ran as an outsider in 2020 against the local political machine (Jeffries endorsed his opponent, former House Foreign Affairs chair Eliot Engel) and unseated a longstanding incumbent. He kept a lower profile in his first term, where daily business was disrupted by the pandemic, which claimed the life of his mother, and the House was still reeling from the Capitol riots.\n\nThis year, however, heâs found his niche as an unapologetically brash, openly defiant politician who uses his platform to rally activists. Nor has he been afraid to stand out on policy: He was one of the few members to defend TikTok while it came under fire from just about every corner of politics.\n\nIn doing so, Bowman says heâs reminding Americans âBlack men are not a monolithâ and that thereâs more ways to get out their message than President Obamaâs more placid approach, which Jeffries has followed.\n\nHe illustrated the contrast by comparing hip hop artists: â Hakeem is more like Jay-Z and I guess Iâm more like Busta Rhymes,â he said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nBowmanâs in-your-face persona challenges one of the biggest taboos in politics: The âangry Black manâ stereotype. Black politicians often worry that a wrong move will overshadow their real grievances, even if white leaders donât face the same constraints.\n\nEspecially among Black leaders with ambitions beyond representing a minority-majority district, politicians tend to follow the footsteps of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. over Malcolm X. The comic duo Key and Peele satirized the famously calm and deliberate Barack Obama with an âanger translatorâ who said all the things that a Black president palatable to white voters could never get away with saying. Keegan-Michael Key ended up performing the act live with Obama himself at the 2015 White House Correspondents Associationâs dinner.\n\nBowman, for his part, is not worried about falling prey to the âangry Black manâ stereotype.\n\nâNah, those days are over,â he said. âThose days are finished. One of the reasons why that video went so viral [is] because Americaâs never seen a Black man yelling at a white man like that.â\n\nThe political landscape has evolved in some ways. Black candidates winning in majority-white cities, states, and districts has become more common in recent years, while white Democrats have moved left on racial issues in ways that may make them more receptive to different styles.\n\nBowman says he favors the rabble rousing approach over the more conciliatory one favored by Jeffries because itâs sometimes needed to draw attention to issues that lawmakers would prefer to ignore.\n\nâIâm yelling because 9-year olds were slaughtered by assault rifles,â he told Semafor. âLike, thatâs why Iâm yelling. Iâm not yelling just to be loud.â\n\nBowman entered the education system on the heels of the Columbine High School massacre. And then the mass shooting at Virginia Tech happened several years later, followed by the Sandy Hook Elementary High School shooting. The year before he ran for office, 34 students within the K-12 system in his district died â17 of them by suicide.\n\nâOne of the murders happened right up the street at New Rochelle High School from the Bronx and no one was talking about it,â he said. âNo elected official, no elected leader was sounding the alarm on children dying. And so thatâs why I ran, because Iâm like, yo, the children dying are the result of something like housing, foster care system, trauma, addiction, criminal justice, but all that connects to policy and we got policymakers silent. So when Iâm yelling, itâs about that.â\n\nAl Sharpton, who last year was the subject of a documentary called âLoudmouth,â told Semafor heâs always defended a more confrontational approach as a complement to politicians with a broader base of support.\n\nIt was part of a long-running argument he had with the late David Dinkins, who was elected the first Black mayor of New York City in 1989 and served during a period of heightened racial tension.\n\nSharpton recalled that Dinkins would often say to him, âAl, you donât have to be that vibrant.â\n\nâI said, âYes, I do. Because you donât understand: The more I put down heat, the more it drives them to you to make a compromise,ââ Sharpton said.\n\nDavid Axelrod, who helped plan Obamaâs political path from Chicago to the White House, honed his craft working to elect Harold Washington, the cityâs first Black mayor . Heâs known for his work helping minority candidates sell their message to voters who may not be used to seeing nonwhite politicians on the ballot.\n\nâIâve worked with Black mayors all over the country, Iâve worked with Deval Patrick when he ran for governor of Massachusetts,â Axelrod said. âObviously, thatâs over the span of three decades so things change and evolve.â\n\nAxelrod saw Bowmanâs hallway outburst against Massie as an educator ârighteously indignant about what was happening to our kids.â But he also warned that approach could diminish the message.\n\nâThe sentiment that he was expressing is one that a lot of people share, but does that get lost? Does the form overtake the content?â Axelrod said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Tim Scott backs new super PAC push aimed at Black voters\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nA Super PAC aligned with Sen. Tim Scott is launching a $14 million-plus campaign aimed at Black and Hispanic voters ahead of the November election.\n\nThe Great Opportunity PAC, led by longtime Scott aide Jennifer DeCasper, says it sees an opportunity to win not just the 2024 presidential election, but also ensure control of both the Senate and the House, by consolidating recent polling gains with Black voters, especially men.\n\nâFrom economics to the border to crime, thereâs a lot of reasons why the shift is becoming just so blatantly obvious that itâs now undeniable that there is something amiss, and itâs real,â Scott told a small group of reporters at a roundtable this week. âI think frankly, itâs not just racial, but itâs going to manifest itself in a racial shift that we havenât seen in probably three decades into politics, and thatâs because working class Americans are banding together, being fused together, by the issues that theyâre confronting on a daily basis, and those issues are more pronounced in the African American community.â\n\nIn a memo sent Thursday to interested parties, DeCasper wrote that the PAC has âa unique opportunity to expand the Republican political coalition and be the difference between whether we win the White House, House, and Senate.â The group has been in touch with the RNC about its plan, which includes courting âother working-class racial minoritiesâ as well.\n\nThe PAC plans to ârun a full scale, 360 degree communications and voter contact plan targeting swing and low propensity Black and brown voters.â The over $14 million budget will include various events and media appearances by lawmakers, as well as digital marketing, direct mail and targeted paid advertising, and canvassing, the memo added.\n\nâIn short, how Black Men and other working-class racial minorities vote could decide this election and their votes are up for grabs,â according to the memo. âIf Trump increases his margin among non-college-educated voters by another 2 points in 2024, and his vote margin among nonwhite voters increased by only 3 points, heâd win five additional states, bringing him to a 297-241 victory in the Electoral College.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBoth of the presidential campaigns have made Black and Latino voter persuasion and turnout a priority this cycle, and the competition for support in both communities looks fiercer than prior Trump races. The Trump campaign announced a new executive director of Black coalitions earlier this week, while the Biden campaign launched a âBlack Voters for Biden-Harrisâ initiative.\n\nScottâs addition to the effort comes as heâs in the running for a potential vice presidential slot â the PAC launch offers a preview of how he might look on the ticket taking a lead role in messaging and events.\n\nAt the roundtable, Scott notably told reporters he believes heâs the right messenger for this topic, saying that heâs performed better with Black voters in South Carolina compared with the average Republican while also winning âblue counties where no Republicans are winning at all.â\n\nDemocratic pollster Cornell Belcher argued back in March that a big focus among Black Americans is âhow they feel about racism and discrimination on the rise â and they point to Donald Trump and what heâs done.â Belcher remained confident that âBlack and brown votersâ¦ are not rushing to embrace Trump or the derelict political party that foisted him on the nationâ because of this, according to a Bloomberg opinion piece.\n\nâDonald Trump is running his campaign the way heâs lived his life: not giving a damn about Black people or our communities,â Biden-Harris senior spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. âTrump entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder and political life trying to delegitimize the first Black president as the architect of birtherism. Itâs why the first thing he did after taking over the RNC was shut down its minority outreach centers, and itâs why heâs now trotting out backbenchers and C-listers in a last-ditch effort to defend his racist agenda. President Biden is on the campaign trail showing up â himself â to earn, and not ask for, Black Americansâ support. That is what leadership looks like.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âThey see strengthâ: The Black sports icons shaping Donald Trumpâs take on race, politics, and masculinity\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FloridaÂ â The road to understanding Donald Trumpâs appeal to a segment of Black America âÂ and his hopes of winning back the presidency by pulling a few precious votes away from Democrats â runs through Trumpâs Black friends, a loose set of iconic sports figures from the 1980s.\n\nThat, at least, was the impression I got from his campaign when I set out to interview Trump about his apparent gains with Black men, a group of voters who some public polls show are more likely to consider backing him this year. Trumpâs aides wouldnât promise a meeting with the former president just yet âÂ instead, they started setting up interviews with older athletes who are supporting his campaign.\n\nNot long after, I got a call from Mets and Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry. That was the beginning of an odyssey through the heroes and villains of my childhood: Over the next few weeks, I chatted with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stood backstage at a Trump rally with retired NFL star Lawrence Taylor, and traveled to meet boxing promoter Don King in person. Eventually, I talked to Trump himself.\n\nThese men, now aged 57 to 92, would make unlikely spokespeople for almost any other candidate and they mostly arenât known for their politics. But they do have a lot in common with Trump. They were household names at the same time as Trumpâs New York heyday. They were frequently in the tabloids, often for the wrong reasons, and it took a push from the campaign to persuade some of them to talk to a strange reporter. Nearly all of them had faced serious legal issues, including several criminal convictions.\n\nI met Trump six days after his own felony conviction, in the âGreat Roomâ at Mar-a-Lago. He had just finished a sit-down with Dr. Phil. I asked him, among other things, what I should take away from his warm relationship with the Black men who had been singing his praises to me.\n\nâThey see what Iâve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,â he said. âThey want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They donât want to have millions of people come and take their jobs. And we â thatâs whatâs happening. These people that are coming into our country are taking jobs away from African Americans and they know it.â\n\nI reminded him I was talking about millionaires, not working stiffs worried about immigrant labor. He conceded, jokingly, that Don King was not at risk of being replaced.\n\nTheir relationships came up more directly after my next question, when I asked how he responds to Black voters who call him racist.\n\nâI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldnât be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,â he told me. âThey would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist â and Iâm not racist!â\n\nWeâll find out in November if Trump wins this argument. He lost Black voters by a 92-8 margin in his last election, according to a Pew Research study , despite high hopes for a breakthrough that cycle. In 2016, he settled for boasting that fewer Black voters had showed up to the polls that year, which he said wasÂ âalmost as goodâ as their support.\n\nBut while he hasnât succeeded yet, Trump was getting at something noteworthy in our conversation. A common obstacle to outreach for Republican politicians is that theyâre often from cloistered, white spaces where they donât have many interactions with Black people. Thatâs not Trumpâs issue: Heâs had famous âBlack friends,â as they say, throughout his career, even as he was constantly dogged by accusations of racism at the same time. The people I spoke to werenât passing acquaintances, either. They had made deals together, weathered crises together, and shared family gatherings together. One had even chaperoned Don Jr. on a trip to Disney World.\n\nAnd while a handful of aging Reagan-era celebrities obviously arenât a stand-in for all Black people, and especially the rank-and-file voters who actually decide elections, they do represent a recognizable part of Black culture that Trump has long been plugged into. His success in the election may partly depend on whether, in this shifting cultural moment, there are enough Americans thinking about the election the way Mike Tyson does.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs aides seemed to think I might understand their candidate because I was shaped by the same New York era. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s at the nexus of these two Black Americas, where ordinary folks and celebrities meet. When I was in my early twenties, I worked at Dooney & Bourke in Trump Tower, selling leather handbags to tourists. I knew Tyson as a global icon, but also as the local bigshot who ran in the same circles as my childhood friendsâ older siblings.\n\nAnd so a couple of weeks after I pitched the campaign an interview, I was in Wildwood, New Jersey talking to Taylor and his old Giants teammate Ottis âOJâ Anderson at a Trump rally. Taylorâs case for Trump was one Iâd heard from voters many, many times before.\n\nâHeâs going to speak his mind,â he told me. âHe doesnât care how it comes out.â\n\nHe added, crucially: âHeâs a manâs man.â\n\nTaylor, like all of the names I had been put in touch with, had a business relationship with Trump at some point as well as a social one. He recalled meeting Trump when he tried to poach him as part of a failed football venture that briefly competed with the NFL. âHe put a million dollars in my account and said, listen, he wants me to play â and weâve been friends ever since,â he said.\n\nAt the time of that rally, Trump was still on trial in a Manhattan court over hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of his first election; he faces three more pending criminal trials in state and federal courts. It was a problem his friends could relate to.\n\nTaylor, who was plagued by off-field issues throughout his Hall-of-Fame playing career, pleaded guilty in 2011 to patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute. (He said he believed she was 19). Trump stood by Tyson in the 1990s while he was jailed on a rape charge that he denied (he also was hosting his fights , which required the boxer to be out of jail). In 2016, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus reportedly intervened to keep King off the 2016 convention stage because of his prior manslaughter conviction.\n\nâThe party could not associate itself with someone convicted of a felony,â the New York Times noted at the time, which might as well have been a thousand years ago.\n\nStrawberry came out the other side of drug addiction and jail to become an evangelical preacher. When I spoke to him, he mentioned that he and other sports stars know what itâs like to face the burning gaze of the public, something he connected to support for Trump.\n\nâPeople are hoping that he comes back, a lot of athletes,â Strawberry said. âA lot of times people are afraid to say â theyâre afraid of public opinion, and Iâve had public opinion my whole lifeâ¦they were saying I couldnât survive, I couldnât make it. And guess what? Iâm still here.â\n\nTrumpâs gains with nonwhite voters in the polls have mostly come from younger Americans . When I mentioned to Trump during our interview that the people that Iâd been directed to talk to all seemed to be associated with a certain bygone period, he immediately thought to add another name to the list.\n\nâDid you give her Herschel?â he asked his staff.\n\nHe was referring to Herschel Walker, the former football star who lost his Senate race last cycle while facing political attacks over allegations of past domestic abuse and previously unacknowledged children. A born-again Christian, Walker told voters at the time that he had moved past a dark period of mental illness and was reformed.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from Walker, who adores Trump. He recalled how they became close in the 1980s, when he was also involved in Trumpâs football endeavors. Walker volunteered to take a young Don Jr. to Disney World with his own family while his team was at training camp in Orlando. The ease with which a white New York businessman befriended âa Black kid who came from this little town with absolutely nothing,â made a strong impression.\n\nâI know the man has got a great heart,â he said.\n\nWalker rejected the premise that Trump had a problem with Black voters âÂ he said he was sick of being asked to âdefendâ him as a Black man, as if supporting Trump required an extraordinary explanation. His advice to the campaign was to start showing up more often in Black neighborhoods and to treat voters the same as they would white voters.\n\nâWhat I told Don is I think you need to go see more Black people in the cities and talk to them,â he said. âI said, you know, they love you.â\n\nThereâs a reason I keep mentioning the shared legal problems of Trump and his friends: Itâs become inextricable from any discussion of his outreach to Black voters.\n\nBefore his Manhattan trial, Trump had taken to comparing his personal legal struggles to those Black men face in the criminal justice system. At one point in February, he boasted that âthe Black populationâ loved seeing his mugshot in Fulton County, Georgia where he faces separate criminal charges over election interference. He has repeatedly compared himself to Nelson Mandela, the late South African president who spent decades as a political prisoner while opposing apartheid.\n\nDemocrats have accused him of reinforcing ugly stereotypes for his personal benefit. When I asked him about the topic, he said it wouldnât be part of his pitch to Black voters â but also couldnât help making the comparison again.\n\nâNo, it wonât be part of my message,â Trump said. âI think itâs through osmosis. They see whatâs happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, theyâve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see whatâs happened to them.â\n\nBlack conservatives arenât always happy about this kind of talk either. Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist, said she broached the topic with Trump at a dinner he hosted with HBCU students on the night of our interview. âDonât put that out there that Black people like you because youâre a felon,â she told me she said to Trump. âThe Black people donât like you because youâre a felon. The Black people who like you like you because they feel like youâre experiencing the things that they have been complaining about for years, and now maybe you can shine a light on the cries that have been falling on deaf ears for all of this time.â\n\nIt might make some people cringe, but itâs easier to understand where Trump gets the impression this is a relatable message when youâre spending time with his famous friends.\n\nâIf I never saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was Black,â Tyson told me. âThe way they were treating him in the papers and in the press? Think about that, the way they treat him in court? Thatâs the way they did Black people.â\n\nKing once said Trump understood Black people ââbecause âno matter what you say or do, you are guilty as hell.â The same week we spoke, rapper 50 Cent said during a Capitol visit that Black men identify with Trump âbecause they got RICO charges,â a reference to the statute being used to prosecute Trump in Georgia.\n\nâLook at what happened to a lot of the people of color and right now the injustice that is happening with Donald,â Walker told me. âRight now, itâs almost just âÂ itâs almost similar to that.â\n\nOf course, the question looming over this and every prior Trump campaign has been whether a few wealthy entertainers and athletes are representative of voters writ large. Thatâs especially true when theyâve faced their own accusations in the public eye that might make them uniquely inclined towards defending Trump.\n\nThereâs at least some early evidence Trump has misread the room in this regard: A poll by Democratic firm Navigator Research found Black voters were the group most likely to think Trump was guilty in the Manhattan case, by a 76-15 margin. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn also noted that their own post-verdict polling showed President Biden shoring up support with younger, politically disengaged, nonwhite voters âÂ the exact group Trump is targeting.\n\nDemocrats have watched Trumpâs polling rise with a mix of shock, anger, and disbelief. He has a long history of remarks that were widely condemned as racist and feuded as president with Black lawmakers like civil rights icon John Lewis , whose district he blasted as âcrime-infestedâ and who he continued to grouse about after his death. Who, they ask, is buying this?\n\nâHeâs trying to lean into his identity, Donald Trumpâs identity, as a criminal, because heâs now a convicted felon,â Rep. Steven Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told me. âItâs not a policy agenda that improves the lives of anyone, much less Black Americans. And not only is it an insult, it is an affront to Black men and Black people and what it is we are fighting forâ\n\nHorsford, who has been holding a tour of Black barbershops in his Las Vegas-area district, described Trumpâs campaign as âa bunch of platitudes with no actual policy or commitment behind them.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has taken Trumpâs polling gains seriously, though. In high-profile campaign speeches, ads, and statements, theyâve tried to remind voters âÂ and especially younger voters âÂ of his history of inflammatory statements and accusations of discrimination .\n\nâDonald Trump has spent his life and political career disrespecting Black men every chance he gets: he entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder, denigrated George Floydâs memory, and launched his political career trying to undermine the first Black president as the architect of birtherism,â Senior Biden Spokesperson Sarafina Chitikatold Semafor.\n\nVoters in their twenties today were children when Trump was leading his false birther charge against Barack Obama, a lengthy public crusade to prove that the first Black president was secretly born in Kenya and that his Ivy League pedigree at Columbia and Harvard Law School was nothing more than affirmative action. He dropped the issue just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nI brought the topic up with Trump in passing; he responded only in generalities about his broader record on issues like HBCU funding. But even some of his friends were stung by that one. Tyson told me he âdidnât agreeâ with Trumpâs Obama-bashing at the time, though he added he didnât let it affect their relationship. Walker chalked it up as âpart of this politics thing.â\n\nDemocrats are also hoping to capture the energy of four years ago, when the nation was engaged in large-scale protests against police brutality and racial inequality, a movement that notably also had broad buy-in from Black athletes in the major sports leagues. Trump condemned the Black Lives Matter movement in his debates with Biden and staged a photo-op outside the White House after riot police tear-gassed Lafayette Square. More recently, he bragged in a Time interview about how he had threatened protestors who âdesecratedâ monuments with 10-year minimum sentences.\n\nThen thereâs the âCentral Park Five,â a group of teenagers who were arrested in 1989 and charged with the rape of a jogger, prompting Trump to take out an ad calling to reinstate the death penalty. They were later exonerated âÂ one recently became a New York City Council member âÂ but Trump has never acknowledged their innocence. Their story is featured in Bidenâs campaign ads .\n\nWhen I spoke to Tyson, he said the topic still comes up when he tries to sell fellow celebrities on Trump.\n\nâThe only thing they can say is that heâs a racist,â he said. âCentral Park Five, other than that, they canât bring up anything else. And most of those famous Black people, they werenât saying that when he was getting them free tickets at the fight and getting them free rooms at the fight âÂ they werenât saying he was a racist then.â\n\nThat Trump is generous to his friends is part of the Democratsâ message, too. Theyâre arguing the former presidentâs sudden interest in discrimination as a smokescreen: Itâs not that he wants a more just legal system, itâs that he wants to abuse the law in order to protect himself, reward his allies, and punish his enemies.\n\nâWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?â Biden said at a Philadelphia event aimed at Black voters in May. âI donât think heâd be talking about pardons.â\n\nTrump has made tough talk on crime central to his campaign. But he also appealed to Black voters in 2020 by touting his work on the First Step Act, the most significant criminal justice reform package in years, and he boasted about granting clemency and pardons to some nonviolent drug offenders .\n\nThe politics of that movement have changed significantly since then. Following a crime surge in his final year in office, Trump began talking less about freeing prisoners on old drug charges, and more about executing drug dealers . A number of Trumpâs Republican primary challengers criticized the First Step Act and even suggested repealing it.\n\nSo I was at least somewhat surprised to hear Trump still sounded largely like it was 2020 when I raised these topics.\n\nâPeople have been treated very unfairly and itâs largely Black people,â he said. âItâs Hispanic people, itâs not just Black.â\n\nIn fact, he talked about expanding the First Step Act âÂ though itâs not clear how, and Trump has a history of promising policy rollouts that are always right around the corner.\n\nâWeâre going to be doing extensions of that,â he told me, adding that heâd release amendments for âstrengthening certain thingsâ while âworking on fairness.â\n\nIn some corners of the right, like Tucker Carlsonâs online show, thereâs been a renewed effort to defend Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota cop who killed George Floyd and is currently in jail for murder. Trump has pledged to âindemnify all police officers and law enforcement officialsâ if heâs re-elected, touching on a longstanding debate about whether police officers should be held personally responsible for their professional actions.\n\nHe has not elaborated on how broadly this policy should be applied, nor is it clear he has much ability to influence these cases at all. But he did tell me he believed Chauvin should not have been shielded from prosecution.\n\nâNo. What he did was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. That was crazy. When I looked at that â I watched that tape many times, no,â he said. âBut they have a lot of people that did a good job, and they were innocent. And you know, theyâve lost everything. Theyâve lost everything.â\n\nâSay hello to Don âÂ I love Don King,â Trump told me before we parted. âHeâs unbelievable. This guy was unique. There was never anybody like Don King.â\n\nAnd so after my visit to Mar-a-Lago, my nostalgia tour took me 45 miles south to Hollywood, Florida, where King was promoting his Fist of Fury boxing event.\n\nWhen I arrived for the weigh-in, King, 92 years old, was slumped in a wheelchair, though still strikingly tall. The light wasnât in his eyes like it used to be, but he could still pull off a look âÂ he was wearing one of his signature rhinestone denim jackets with an American flag design that heâs been photographed in many times before. With the assistance of his two grandsons, he was able to get on stage and stand just long enough to pose between boxers during their staredowns.\n\nKing wasnât in the mood to chat much, but his niece was there to help him get around. A self-described â Republicrat ,â he enthusiastically backed Trump in his prior campaigns and Jean King Battle told me her uncle has a lifesize cutout of Trump in their family room âbecause heâs family to my uncle.â When I approached him the next day, he seemed unaware we were scheduled to talk.\n\nBut Trump was right about one thing: The place had strong MAGA vibes and they were feeding off the testosterone in the room.\n\nâThatâs my nâa,â boxer Adrien Broner, 34, said when Trump was mentioned at the weigh-in. When I asked him to elaborate, he said, âTrumpâs the man. When Trump was in office, everybody was eating.â Dressed in a taxi-yellow sweatsuit with âWORK OR DIEâ on the back he added, âHeâs a man that means business. Just like me.â\n\nA promoter at the event, Egypt Brown, characterized Trumpâs allure in the boxing world as rooted in masculinity. âThey donât connect with Pride month as a fighter,â Brown told me. âThey donât connect with women fighting with men in their sport because itâs all about competition.â\n\nIâd heard similar things in Philadelphia just days earlier, when Republican Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt hosted a â Congress, Cognac, and Cigars â gathering at a smoking lounge to discuss Black male politics. Democratsâ emphasis on LGBTQ issues was helping drive Black voters to Republicans, Donalds said, while an audience member complained to me that feminism was leaving Black men behind.\n\nâThey intentionally promote the Black woman so she can look down on the Black man,â said Michael Blackwell, 60. âSo not only is society looking down at us, now the Black woman is because she got a hundred thousand dollars, got a career. Sheâs been conditioned to not need a man.â\n\nMy 1980s road trip through Donald Trumpâs star-studded world may wind up being a sideshow âÂ just another journalistâs half-futile attempt to understand the direction of the American public. Or it may be a kind of early warning system of something deeper.\n\nLeaders across the political spectrum are scrambling to channel the shifting politics of gender and a sense that men, in particular, have become alienated from the political system. Republicans have long argued that Black voters are more socially conservative than their vote indicates; their hope is that making elections a referendum on traditional masculinity will find a receptive audience.\n\nA big question is whether Trump has an operation ready to capitalize on his polling: The Biden campaign pointed to the newly revamped RNCâs struggles to nail their own program, including an initial decision to close minority outreach centers.\n\nTrumpâs effort is still in its early stages and has been stymied by a lack of direction, with no dedicated lead for ethnic and faith-based outreach. The campaign tapped Gina Carr to focus on Black outreach around the time of his South Bronx rally last month, which was touted as a show of his dedication to reaching nonwhite voters. But itâs still not clear the level of resources or scheduling the campaign plans to roll out, or whether it might release a targeted policy platform for Black Americans like 2020âs â Platinum Plan .â Lynne Patton, his senior advisor, said in a statement that his âpledge to Black Americansâ would be to âreinstateâ his old policies on issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nBut no one should assume Black voters are permanently immune to the kinds of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters âÂ that Trumpâs business success translates to success overseeing an economy, or that his personal problems equate to their personal problems, or that his distrust of the âdeep stateâ echoes their suspicions about government or media or corporations. Trump would hardly be the first candidate to try to beat an unpopular incumbent by feeding votersâ frustrations, avoiding policy specifics, and asking them to project their hopes on him.\n\nI asked Tyson about his interactions with ordinary people when it comes to Trump. He told me fans he meets are skeptical, but that his relationship with the former president makes them curious if theyâre missing something.\n\nâStreet people, they say âYo, I donât fâ with your man [Trump], but he loves you,ââ he said. âThey want to meet him. They ask me âwhat is he like?ââ\n\nAnd what does he tell them?\n\nâHeâs a people person,â he said. âThe common people voted him into office. It wasnât no big shot that voted him in office.â\n\nNot everyone buys the premise that Trumpâs gains with Black voters in polls will translate to the real world. While he has some concerns about younger voters, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher told me that about 14% of Black men have typically voted Republican in non-Obama cycles and heâs seen little in his own polling of likely voters âÂ and especially in recent election results â to indicate this will change in a major way.\n\nâ[There] is literally no evidence in actual voting that Black voters, including Black men, are somehow historically breaking Republican,â Belcher said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âThey see strengthâ: The Black sports icons shaping Donald Trumpâs take on race, politics, and masculinity\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FloridaÂ â The road to understanding Donald Trumpâs appeal to a segment of Black America âÂ and his hopes of winning back the presidency by pulling a few precious votes away from Democrats â runs through Trumpâs Black friends, a loose set of iconic sports figures from the 1980s.\n\nThat, at least, was the impression I got from his campaign when I set out to interview Trump about his apparent gains with Black men, a group of voters who some public polls show are more likely to consider backing him this year. Trumpâs aides wouldnât promise a meeting with the former president just yet âÂ instead, they started setting up interviews with older athletes who are supporting his campaign.\n\nNot long after, I got a call from Mets and Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry. That was the beginning of an odyssey through the heroes and villains of my childhood: Over the next few weeks, I chatted with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stood backstage at a Trump rally with retired NFL star Lawrence Taylor, and traveled to meet boxing promoter Don King in person. Eventually, I talked to Trump himself.\n\nThese men, now aged 57 to 92, would make unlikely spokespeople for almost any other candidate and they mostly arenât known for their politics. But they do have a lot in common with Trump. They were household names at the same time as Trumpâs New York heyday. They were frequently in the tabloids, often for the wrong reasons, and it took a push from the campaign to persuade some of them to talk to a strange reporter. Nearly all of them had faced serious legal issues, including several criminal convictions.\n\nI met Trump six days after his own felony conviction, in the âGreat Roomâ at Mar-a-Lago. He had just finished a sit-down with Dr. Phil. I asked him, among other things, what I should take away from his warm relationship with the Black men who had been singing his praises to me.\n\nâThey see what Iâve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,â he said. âThey want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They donât want to have millions of people come and take their jobs. And we â thatâs whatâs happening. These people that are coming into our country are taking jobs away from African Americans and they know it.â\n\nI reminded him I was talking about millionaires, not working stiffs worried about immigrant labor. He conceded, jokingly, that Don King was not at risk of being replaced.\n\nTheir relationships came up more directly after my next question, when I asked how he responds to Black voters who call him racist.\n\nâI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldnât be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,â he told me. âThey would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist â and Iâm not racist!â\n\nWeâll find out in November if Trump wins this argument. He lost Black voters by a 92-8 margin in his last election, according to a Pew Research study , despite high hopes for a breakthrough that cycle. In 2016, he settled for boasting that fewer Black voters had showed up to the polls that year, which he said wasÂ âalmost as goodâ as their support.\n\nBut while he hasnât succeeded yet, Trump was getting at something noteworthy in our conversation. A common obstacle to outreach for Republican politicians is that theyâre often from cloistered, white spaces where they donât have many interactions with Black people. Thatâs not Trumpâs issue: Heâs had famous âBlack friends,â as they say, throughout his career, even as he was constantly dogged by accusations of racism at the same time. The people I spoke to werenât passing acquaintances, either. They had made deals together, weathered crises together, and shared family gatherings together. One had even chaperoned Don Jr. on a trip to Disney World.\n\nAnd while a handful of aging Reagan-era celebrities obviously arenât a stand-in for all Black people, and especially the rank-and-file voters who actually decide elections, they do represent a recognizable part of Black culture that Trump has long been plugged into. His success in the election may partly depend on whether, in this shifting cultural moment, there are enough Americans thinking about the election the way Mike Tyson does.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs aides seemed to think I might understand their candidate because I was shaped by the same New York era. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s at the nexus of these two Black Americas, where ordinary folks and celebrities meet. When I was in my early twenties, I worked at Dooney & Bourke in Trump Tower, selling leather handbags to tourists. I knew Tyson as a global icon, but also as the local bigshot who ran in the same circles as my childhood friendsâ older siblings.\n\nAnd so a couple of weeks after I pitched the campaign an interview, I was in Wildwood, New Jersey talking to Taylor and his old Giants teammate Ottis âOJâ Anderson at a Trump rally. Taylorâs case for Trump was one Iâd heard from voters many, many times before.\n\nâHeâs going to speak his mind,â he told me. âHe doesnât care how it comes out.â\n\nHe added, crucially: âHeâs a manâs man.â\n\nTaylor, like all of the names I had been put in touch with, had a business relationship with Trump at some point as well as a social one. He recalled meeting Trump when he tried to poach him as part of a failed football venture that briefly competed with the NFL. âHe put a million dollars in my account and said, listen, he wants me to play â and weâve been friends ever since,â he said.\n\nAt the time of that rally, Trump was still on trial in a Manhattan court over hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of his first election; he faces three more pending criminal trials in state and federal courts. It was a problem his friends could relate to.\n\nTaylor, who was plagued by off-field issues throughout his Hall-of-Fame playing career, pleaded guilty in 2011 to patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute. (He said he believed she was 19). Trump stood by Tyson in the 1990s while he was jailed on a rape charge that he denied (he also was hosting his fights , which required the boxer to be out of jail). In 2016, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus reportedly intervened to keep King off the 2016 convention stage because of his prior manslaughter conviction.\n\nâThe party could not associate itself with someone convicted of a felony,â the New York Times noted at the time, which might as well have been a thousand years ago.\n\nStrawberry came out the other side of drug addiction and jail to become an evangelical preacher. When I spoke to him, he mentioned that he and other sports stars know what itâs like to face the burning gaze of the public, something he connected to support for Trump.\n\nâPeople are hoping that he comes back, a lot of athletes,â Strawberry said. âA lot of times people are afraid to say â theyâre afraid of public opinion, and Iâve had public opinion my whole lifeâ¦they were saying I couldnât survive, I couldnât make it. And guess what? Iâm still here.â\n\nTrumpâs gains with nonwhite voters in the polls have mostly come from younger Americans . When I mentioned to Trump during our interview that the people that Iâd been directed to talk to all seemed to be associated with a certain bygone period, he immediately thought to add another name to the list.\n\nâDid you give her Herschel?â he asked his staff.\n\nHe was referring to Herschel Walker, the former football star who lost his Senate race last cycle while facing political attacks over allegations of past domestic abuse and previously unacknowledged children. A born-again Christian, Walker told voters at the time that he had moved past a dark period of mental illness and was reformed.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from Walker, who adores Trump. He recalled how they became close in the 1980s, when he was also involved in Trumpâs football endeavors. Walker volunteered to take a young Don Jr. to Disney World with his own family while his team was at training camp in Orlando. The ease with which a white New York businessman befriended âa Black kid who came from this little town with absolutely nothing,â made a strong impression.\n\nâI know the man has got a great heart,â he said.\n\nWalker rejected the premise that Trump had a problem with Black voters âÂ he said he was sick of being asked to âdefendâ him as a Black man, as if supporting Trump required an extraordinary explanation. His advice to the campaign was to start showing up more often in Black neighborhoods and to treat voters the same as they would white voters.\n\nâWhat I told Don is I think you need to go see more Black people in the cities and talk to them,â he said. âI said, you know, they love you.â\n\nThereâs a reason I keep mentioning the shared legal problems of Trump and his friends: Itâs become inextricable from any discussion of his outreach to Black voters.\n\nBefore his Manhattan trial, Trump had taken to comparing his personal legal struggles to those Black men face in the criminal justice system. At one point in February, he boasted that âthe Black populationâ loved seeing his mugshot in Fulton County, Georgia where he faces separate criminal charges over election interference. He has repeatedly compared himself to Nelson Mandela, the late South African president who spent decades as a political prisoner while opposing apartheid.\n\nDemocrats have accused him of reinforcing ugly stereotypes for his personal benefit. When I asked him about the topic, he said it wouldnât be part of his pitch to Black voters â but also couldnât help making the comparison again.\n\nâNo, it wonât be part of my message,â Trump said. âI think itâs through osmosis. They see whatâs happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, theyâve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see whatâs happened to them.â\n\nBlack conservatives arenât always happy about this kind of talk either. Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist, said she broached the topic with Trump at a dinner he hosted with HBCU students on the night of our interview. âDonât put that out there that Black people like you because youâre a felon,â she told me she said to Trump. âThe Black people donât like you because youâre a felon. The Black people who like you like you because they feel like youâre experiencing the things that they have been complaining about for years, and now maybe you can shine a light on the cries that have been falling on deaf ears for all of this time.â\n\nIt might make some people cringe, but itâs easier to understand where Trump gets the impression this is a relatable message when youâre spending time with his famous friends.\n\nâIf I never saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was Black,â Tyson told me. âThe way they were treating him in the papers and in the press? Think about that, the way they treat him in court? Thatâs the way they did Black people.â\n\nKing once said Trump understood Black people ââbecause âno matter what you say or do, you are guilty as hell.â The same week we spoke, rapper 50 Cent said during a Capitol visit that Black men identify with Trump âbecause they got RICO charges,â a reference to the statute being used to prosecute Trump in Georgia.\n\nâLook at what happened to a lot of the people of color and right now the injustice that is happening with Donald,â Walker told me. âRight now, itâs almost just âÂ itâs almost similar to that.â\n\nOf course, the question looming over this and every prior Trump campaign has been whether a few wealthy entertainers and athletes are representative of voters writ large. Thatâs especially true when theyâve faced their own accusations in the public eye that might make them uniquely inclined towards defending Trump.\n\nThereâs at least some early evidence Trump has misread the room in this regard: A poll by Democratic firm Navigator Research found Black voters were the group most likely to think Trump was guilty in the Manhattan case, by a 76-15 margin. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn also noted that their own post-verdict polling showed President Biden shoring up support with younger, politically disengaged, nonwhite voters âÂ the exact group Trump is targeting.\n\nDemocrats have watched Trumpâs polling rise with a mix of shock, anger, and disbelief. He has a long history of remarks that were widely condemned as racist and feuded as president with Black lawmakers like civil rights icon John Lewis , whose district he blasted as âcrime-infestedâ and who he continued to grouse about after his death. Who, they ask, is buying this?\n\nâHeâs trying to lean into his identity, Donald Trumpâs identity, as a criminal, because heâs now a convicted felon,â Rep. Steven Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told me. âItâs not a policy agenda that improves the lives of anyone, much less Black Americans. And not only is it an insult, it is an affront to Black men and Black people and what it is we are fighting forâ\n\nHorsford, who has been holding a tour of Black barbershops in his Las Vegas-area district, described Trumpâs campaign as âa bunch of platitudes with no actual policy or commitment behind them.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has taken Trumpâs polling gains seriously, though. In high-profile campaign speeches, ads, and statements, theyâve tried to remind voters âÂ and especially younger voters âÂ of his history of inflammatory statements and accusations of discrimination .\n\nâDonald Trump has spent his life and political career disrespecting Black men every chance he gets: he entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder, denigrated George Floydâs memory, and launched his political career trying to undermine the first Black president as the architect of birtherism,â Senior Biden Spokesperson Sarafina Chitikatold Semafor.\n\nVoters in their twenties today were children when Trump was leading his false birther charge against Barack Obama, a lengthy public crusade to prove that the first Black president was secretly born in Kenya and that his Ivy League pedigree at Columbia and Harvard Law School was nothing more than affirmative action. He dropped the issue just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nI brought the topic up with Trump in passing; he responded only in generalities about his broader record on issues like HBCU funding. But even some of his friends were stung by that one. Tyson told me he âdidnât agreeâ with Trumpâs Obama-bashing at the time, though he added he didnât let it affect their relationship. Walker chalked it up as âpart of this politics thing.â\n\nDemocrats are also hoping to capture the energy of four years ago, when the nation was engaged in large-scale protests against police brutality and racial inequality, a movement that notably also had broad buy-in from Black athletes in the major sports leagues. Trump condemned the Black Lives Matter movement in his debates with Biden and staged a photo-op outside the White House after riot police tear-gassed Lafayette Square. More recently, he bragged in a Time interview about how he had threatened protestors who âdesecratedâ monuments with 10-year minimum sentences.\n\nThen thereâs the âCentral Park Five,â a group of teenagers who were arrested in 1989 and charged with the rape of a jogger, prompting Trump to take out an ad calling to reinstate the death penalty. They were later exonerated âÂ one recently became a New York City Council member âÂ but Trump has never acknowledged their innocence. Their story is featured in Bidenâs campaign ads .\n\nWhen I spoke to Tyson, he said the topic still comes up when he tries to sell fellow celebrities on Trump.\n\nâThe only thing they can say is that heâs a racist,â he said. âCentral Park Five, other than that, they canât bring up anything else. And most of those famous Black people, they werenât saying that when he was getting them free tickets at the fight and getting them free rooms at the fight âÂ they werenât saying he was a racist then.â\n\nThat Trump is generous to his friends is part of the Democratsâ message, too. Theyâre arguing the former presidentâs sudden interest in discrimination as a smokescreen: Itâs not that he wants a more just legal system, itâs that he wants to abuse the law in order to protect himself, reward his allies, and punish his enemies.\n\nâWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?â Biden said at a Philadelphia event aimed at Black voters in May. âI donât think heâd be talking about pardons.â\n\nTrump has made tough talk on crime central to his campaign. But he also appealed to Black voters in 2020 by touting his work on the First Step Act, the most significant criminal justice reform package in years, and he boasted about granting clemency and pardons to some nonviolent drug offenders .\n\nThe politics of that movement have changed significantly since then. Following a crime surge in his final year in office, Trump began talking less about freeing prisoners on old drug charges, and more about executing drug dealers . A number of Trumpâs Republican primary challengers criticized the First Step Act and even suggested repealing it.\n\nSo I was at least somewhat surprised to hear Trump still sounded largely like it was 2020 when I raised these topics.\n\nâPeople have been treated very unfairly and itâs largely Black people,â he said. âItâs Hispanic people, itâs not just Black.â\n\nIn fact, he talked about expanding the First Step Act âÂ though itâs not clear how, and Trump has a history of promising policy rollouts that are always right around the corner.\n\nâWeâre going to be doing extensions of that,â he told me, adding that heâd release amendments for âstrengthening certain thingsâ while âworking on fairness.â\n\nIn some corners of the right, like Tucker Carlsonâs online show, thereâs been a renewed effort to defend Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota cop who killed George Floyd and is currently in jail for murder. Trump has pledged to âindemnify all police officers and law enforcement officialsâ if heâs re-elected, touching on a longstanding debate about whether police officers should be held personally responsible for their professional actions.\n\nHe has not elaborated on how broadly this policy should be applied, nor is it clear he has much ability to influence these cases at all. But he did tell me he believed Chauvin should not have been shielded from prosecution.\n\nâNo. What he did was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. That was crazy. When I looked at that â I watched that tape many times, no,â he said. âBut they have a lot of people that did a good job, and they were innocent. And you know, theyâve lost everything. Theyâve lost everything.â\n\nâSay hello to Don âÂ I love Don King,â Trump told me before we parted. âHeâs unbelievable. This guy was unique. There was never anybody like Don King.â\n\nAnd so after my visit to Mar-a-Lago, my nostalgia tour took me 45 miles south to Hollywood, Florida, where King was promoting his Fist of Fury boxing event.\n\nWhen I arrived for the weigh-in, King, 92 years old, was slumped in a wheelchair, though still strikingly tall. The light wasnât in his eyes like it used to be, but he could still pull off a look âÂ he was wearing one of his signature rhinestone denim jackets with an American flag design that heâs been photographed in many times before. With the assistance of his two grandsons, he was able to get on stage and stand just long enough to pose between boxers during their staredowns.\n\nKing wasnât in the mood to chat much, but his niece was there to help him get around. A self-described â Republicrat ,â he enthusiastically backed Trump in his prior campaigns and Jean King Battle told me her uncle has a lifesize cutout of Trump in their family room âbecause heâs family to my uncle.â When I approached him the next day, he seemed unaware we were scheduled to talk.\n\nBut Trump was right about one thing: The place had strong MAGA vibes and they were feeding off the testosterone in the room.\n\nâThatâs my nâa,â boxer Adrien Broner, 34, said when Trump was mentioned at the weigh-in. When I asked him to elaborate, he said, âTrumpâs the man. When Trump was in office, everybody was eating.â Dressed in a taxi-yellow sweatsuit with âWORK OR DIEâ on the back he added, âHeâs a man that means business. Just like me.â\n\nA promoter at the event, Egypt Brown, characterized Trumpâs allure in the boxing world as rooted in masculinity. âThey donât connect with Pride month as a fighter,â Brown told me. âThey donât connect with women fighting with men in their sport because itâs all about competition.â\n\nIâd heard similar things in Philadelphia just days earlier, when Republican Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt hosted a â Congress, Cognac, and Cigars â gathering at a smoking lounge to discuss Black male politics. Democratsâ emphasis on LGBTQ issues was helping drive Black voters to Republicans, Donalds said, while an audience member complained to me that feminism was leaving Black men behind.\n\nâThey intentionally promote the Black woman so she can look down on the Black man,â said Michael Blackwell, 60. âSo not only is society looking down at us, now the Black woman is because she got a hundred thousand dollars, got a career. Sheâs been conditioned to not need a man.â\n\nMy 1980s road trip through Donald Trumpâs star-studded world may wind up being a sideshow âÂ just another journalistâs half-futile attempt to understand the direction of the American public. Or it may be a kind of early warning system of something deeper.\n\nLeaders across the political spectrum are scrambling to channel the shifting politics of gender and a sense that men, in particular, have become alienated from the political system. Republicans have long argued that Black voters are more socially conservative than their vote indicates; their hope is that making elections a referendum on traditional masculinity will find a receptive audience.\n\nA big question is whether Trump has an operation ready to capitalize on his polling: The Biden campaign pointed to the newly revamped RNCâs struggles to nail their own program, including an initial decision to close minority outreach centers.\n\nTrumpâs effort is still in its early stages and has been stymied by a lack of direction, with no dedicated lead for ethnic and faith-based outreach. The campaign tapped Gina Carr to focus on Black outreach around the time of his South Bronx rally last month, which was touted as a show of his dedication to reaching nonwhite voters. But itâs still not clear the level of resources or scheduling the campaign plans to roll out, or whether it might release a targeted policy platform for Black Americans like 2020âs â Platinum Plan .â Lynne Patton, his senior advisor, said in a statement that his âpledge to Black Americansâ would be to âreinstateâ his old policies on issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nBut no one should assume Black voters are permanently immune to the kinds of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters âÂ that Trumpâs business success translates to success overseeing an economy, or that his personal problems equate to their personal problems, or that his distrust of the âdeep stateâ echoes their suspicions about government or media or corporations. Trump would hardly be the first candidate to try to beat an unpopular incumbent by feeding votersâ frustrations, avoiding policy specifics, and asking them to project their hopes on him.\n\nI asked Tyson about his interactions with ordinary people when it comes to Trump. He told me fans he meets are skeptical, but that his relationship with the former president makes them curious if theyâre missing something.\n\nâStreet people, they say âYo, I donât fâ with your man [Trump], but he loves you,ââ he said. âThey want to meet him.

      "text": "Nashville council reinstates expelled Tennessee lawmaker Justin Jones to state House\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nJust days after the GOP-led Tennessee State House expelled State Rep. Justin Jones over his gun control protest on the chamber floor, the Nashville Metro Council voted unanimously to reinstate him as the interim district representative in the General Assembly.\n\nThe expulsion of Jones and another Black Democratic lawmaker, State Rep. Justin Pearson has prompted outrage from Democrats across the country, with President Joe Biden calling the expulsions âundemocratic.â\n\nWithin minutes of the Metro Council meeting beginning, the council suspended rules regarding appointments and nominated Jones, sending him back to the House of Representatives.\n\nâWe are restoring the political voice of the 70,000 people of District 52,â Council member Zulfat Suara said, ahead of the vote. âTheir will shouldâve never been undermined.â\n\nJones, Pearson, and State Rep. Gloria Johnson were hailed as the â Tennessee threeâ after they joined hundreds of protesters on the House floor calling for gun reform legislation in light of the deadly Nashville school shooting.\n\nThe Tennessee House of Representatives on Friday then voted on whether to expel the three lawmakers for violating rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor and for not asking permission to protest. Jones and Pearson â both Black men â were expelled, but Johnson, a white woman, was not, prompting allegations of racism.\n\nThe rare expulsions sparked nationwide condemnation. Only two other Tennessee representatives have been expelled in 157 years with neither  incident centered on a protest.\n\nPer Tennessee law, city councils are tasked with filling a vacant seat. While the appointment process generally takes four week s, according to the Tennessean, the Nashville Metro Council suspended the rules and held an emergency vote to first nominate, and then elect Jones to the vacancy.\n\nState House Speaker Cameron Sexton, a Republican, had compared the gun reform protest to the Jan. 6 insurrection . He later told reporters that he would seat both Jones and Pearson if their respective local bodies voted to reinstate them.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

The Democratsâ social justice-oriented âGreat Societyâ rhetoric no longer resonates with upwardly mobile Latino, Black and Asian voters, a Democratic political consultant told Axios. âDemocrats cannot conceive that non-white voters are anything other than civil rights voters,â a Republican consultant added. Some pundits are befuddled by Republican candidate Donald Trumpâs apparent gains among Black men, for instance, but â no one should assume that Black men are permanently immune to the kind of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters,â Semaforâs Kadia Goba argued.\n\nTalk of a single ethnic minority voting bloc risks obscuring the âstark differencesâ that exist between different ethnic communities, UK in a Changing Europe wrote in a recent report: For example, Hindu voters were more likely to vote Conservative in 2019 than any other non-white religious group, and British Indians and British Chinese voters tend to be more right-wing on the economy and welfare provision than other ethnic groups, while those of Bangladeshi and Caribbean descent are more left-leaning. While Labour still ultimately commands more ethnic minority support than the Conservatives, that support â could disappear very quickly â in future elections, Focal Dataâs chief research officer argued.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "âThey see strengthâ: The Black sports icons shaping Donald Trumpâs take on race, politics, and masculinity\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FloridaÂ â The road to understanding Donald Trumpâs appeal to a segment of Black America âÂ and his hopes of winning back the presidency by pulling a few precious votes away from Democrats â runs through Trumpâs Black friends, a loose set of iconic sports figures from the 1980s.\n\nThat, at least, was the impression I got from his campaign when I set out to interview Trump about his apparent gains with Black men, a group of voters who some public polls show are more likely to consider backing him this year. Trumpâs aides wouldnât promise a meeting with the former president just yet âÂ instead, they started setting up interviews with older athletes who are supporting his campaign.\n\nNot long after, I got a call from Mets and Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry. That was the beginning of an odyssey through the heroes and villains of my childhood: Over the next few weeks, I chatted with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stood backstage at a Trump rally with retired NFL star Lawrence Taylor, and traveled to meet boxing promoter Don King in person. Eventually, I talked to Trump himself.\n\nThese men, now aged 57 to 92, would make unlikely spokespeople for almost any other candidate and they mostly arenât known for their politics. But they do have a lot in common with Trump. They were household names at the same time as Trumpâs New York heyday. They were frequently in the tabloids, often for the wrong reasons, and it took a push from the campaign to persuade some of them to talk to a strange reporter. Nearly all of them had faced serious legal issues, including several criminal convictions.\n\nI met Trump six days after his own felony conviction, in the âGreat Roomâ at Mar-a-Lago. He had just finished a sit-down with Dr. Phil. I asked him, among other things, what I should take away from his warm relationship with the Black men who had been singing his praises to me.\n\nâThey see what Iâve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,â he said. âThey want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They donât want to have millions of people come and take their jobs. And we â thatâs whatâs happening. These people that are coming into our country are taking jobs away from African Americans and they know it.â\n\nI reminded him I was talking about millionaires, not working stiffs worried about immigrant labor. He conceded, jokingly, that Don King was not at risk of being replaced.\n\nTheir relationships came up more directly after my next question, when I asked how he responds to Black voters who call him racist.\n\nâI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldnât be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,â he told me. âThey would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist â and Iâm not racist!â\n\nWeâll find out in November if Trump wins this argument. He lost Black voters by a 92-8 margin in his last election, according to a Pew Research study , despite high hopes for a breakthrough that cycle. In 2016, he settled for boasting that fewer Black voters had showed up to the polls that year, which he said wasÂ âalmost as goodâ as their support.\n\nBut while he hasnât succeeded yet, Trump was getting at something noteworthy in our conversation. A common obstacle to outreach for Republican politicians is that theyâre often from cloistered, white spaces where they donât have many interactions with Black people. Thatâs not Trumpâs issue: Heâs had famous âBlack friends,â as they say, throughout his career, even as he was constantly dogged by accusations of racism at the same time. The people I spoke to werenât passing acquaintances, either. They had made deals together, weathered crises together, and shared family gatherings together. One had even chaperoned Don Jr. on a trip to Disney World.\n\nAnd while a handful of aging Reagan-era celebrities obviously arenât a stand-in for all Black people, and especially the rank-and-file voters who actually decide elections, they do represent a recognizable part of Black culture that Trump has long been plugged into. His success in the election may partly depend on whether, in this shifting cultural moment, there are enough Americans thinking about the election the way Mike Tyson does.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs aides seemed to think I might understand their candidate because I was shaped by the same New York era. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s at the nexus of these two Black Americas, where ordinary folks and celebrities meet. When I was in my early twenties, I worked at Dooney & Bourke in Trump Tower, selling leather handbags to tourists. I knew Tyson as a global icon, but also as the local bigshot who ran in the same circles as my childhood friendsâ older siblings.\n\nAnd so a couple of weeks after I pitched the campaign an interview, I was in Wildwood, New Jersey talking to Taylor and his old Giants teammate Ottis âOJâ Anderson at a Trump rally. Taylorâs case for Trump was one Iâd heard from voters many, many times before.\n\nâHeâs going to speak his mind,â he told me. âHe doesnât care how it comes out.â\n\nHe added, crucially: âHeâs a manâs man.â\n\nTaylor, like all of the names I had been put in touch with, had a business relationship with Trump at some point as well as a social one. He recalled meeting Trump when he tried to poach him as part of a failed football venture that briefly competed with the NFL. âHe put a million dollars in my account and said, listen, he wants me to play â and weâve been friends ever since,â he said.\n\nAt the time of that rally, Trump was still on trial in a Manhattan court over hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of his first election; he faces three more pending criminal trials in state and federal courts. It was a problem his friends could relate to.\n\nTaylor, who was plagued by off-field issues throughout his Hall-of-Fame playing career, pleaded guilty in 2011 to patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute. (He said he believed she was 19). Trump stood by Tyson in the 1990s while he was jailed on a rape charge that he denied (he also was hosting his fights , which required the boxer to be out of jail). In 2016, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus reportedly intervened to keep King off the 2016 convention stage because of his prior manslaughter conviction.\n\nâThe party could not associate itself with someone convicted of a felony,â the New York Times noted at the time, which might as well have been a thousand years ago.\n\nStrawberry came out the other side of drug addiction and jail to become an evangelical preacher. When I spoke to him, he mentioned that he and other sports stars know what itâs like to face the burning gaze of the public, something he connected to support for Trump.\n\nâPeople are hoping that he comes back, a lot of athletes,â Strawberry said. âA lot of times people are afraid to say â theyâre afraid of public opinion, and Iâve had public opinion my whole lifeâ¦they were saying I couldnât survive, I couldnât make it. And guess what? Iâm still here.â\n\nTrumpâs gains with nonwhite voters in the polls have mostly come from younger Americans . When I mentioned to Trump during our interview that the people that Iâd been directed to talk to all seemed to be associated with a certain bygone period, he immediately thought to add another name to the list.\n\nâDid you give her Herschel?â he asked his staff.\n\nHe was referring to Herschel Walker, the former football star who lost his Senate race last cycle while facing political attacks over allegations of past domestic abuse and previously unacknowledged children. A born-again Christian, Walker told voters at the time that he had moved past a dark period of mental illness and was reformed.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from Walker, who adores Trump. He recalled how they became close in the 1980s, when he was also involved in Trumpâs football endeavors. Walker volunteered to take a young Don Jr. to Disney World with his own family while his team was at training camp in Orlando. The ease with which a white New York businessman befriended âa Black kid who came from this little town with absolutely nothing,â made a strong impression.\n\nâI know the man has got a great heart,â he said.\n\nWalker rejected the premise that Trump had a problem with Black voters âÂ he said he was sick of being asked to âdefendâ him as a Black man, as if supporting Trump required an extraordinary explanation. His advice to the campaign was to start showing up more often in Black neighborhoods and to treat voters the same as they would white voters.\n\nâWhat I told Don is I think you need to go see more Black people in the cities and talk to them,â he said. âI said, you know, they love you.â\n\nThereâs a reason I keep mentioning the shared legal problems of Trump and his friends: Itâs become inextricable from any discussion of his outreach to Black voters.\n\nBefore his Manhattan trial, Trump had taken to comparing his personal legal struggles to those Black men face in the criminal justice system. At one point in February, he boasted that âthe Black populationâ loved seeing his mugshot in Fulton County, Georgia where he faces separate criminal charges over election interference. He has repeatedly compared himself to Nelson Mandela, the late South African president who spent decades as a political prisoner while opposing apartheid.\n\nDemocrats have accused him of reinforcing ugly stereotypes for his personal benefit. When I asked him about the topic, he said it wouldnât be part of his pitch to Black voters â but also couldnât help making the comparison again.\n\nâNo, it wonât be part of my message,â Trump said. âI think itâs through osmosis. They see whatâs happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, theyâve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see whatâs happened to them.â\n\nBlack conservatives arenât always happy about this kind of talk either. Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist, said she broached the topic with Trump at a dinner he hosted with HBCU students on the night of our interview. âDonât put that out there that Black people like you because youâre a felon,â she told me she said to Trump. âThe Black people donât like you because youâre a felon. The Black people who like you like you because they feel like youâre experiencing the things that they have been complaining about for years, and now maybe you can shine a light on the cries that have been falling on deaf ears for all of this time.â\n\nIt might make some people cringe, but itâs easier to understand where Trump gets the impression this is a relatable message when youâre spending time with his famous friends.\n\nâIf I never saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was Black,â Tyson told me. âThe way they were treating him in the papers and in the press? Think about that, the way they treat him in court? Thatâs the way they did Black people.â\n\nKing once said Trump understood Black people ââbecause âno matter what you say or do, you are guilty as hell.â The same week we spoke, rapper 50 Cent said during a Capitol visit that Black men identify with Trump âbecause they got RICO charges,â a reference to the statute being used to prosecute Trump in Georgia.\n\nâLook at what happened to a lot of the people of color and right now the injustice that is happening with Donald,â Walker told me. âRight now, itâs almost just âÂ itâs almost similar to that.â\n\nOf course, the question looming over this and every prior Trump campaign has been whether a few wealthy entertainers and athletes are representative of voters writ large. Thatâs especially true when theyâve faced their own accusations in the public eye that might make them uniquely inclined towards defending Trump.\n\nThereâs at least some early evidence Trump has misread the room in this regard: A poll by Democratic firm Navigator Research found Black voters were the group most likely to think Trump was guilty in the Manhattan case, by a 76-15 margin. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn also noted that their own post-verdict polling showed President Biden shoring up support with younger, politically disengaged, nonwhite voters âÂ the exact group Trump is targeting.\n\nDemocrats have watched Trumpâs polling rise with a mix of shock, anger, and disbelief. He has a long history of remarks that were widely condemned as racist and feuded as president with Black lawmakers like civil rights icon John Lewis , whose district he blasted as âcrime-infestedâ and who he continued to grouse about after his death. Who, they ask, is buying this?\n\nâHeâs trying to lean into his identity, Donald Trumpâs identity, as a criminal, because heâs now a convicted felon,â Rep. Steven Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told me. âItâs not a policy agenda that improves the lives of anyone, much less Black Americans. And not only is it an insult, it is an affront to Black men and Black people and what it is we are fighting forâ\n\nHorsford, who has been holding a tour of Black barbershops in his Las Vegas-area district, described Trumpâs campaign as âa bunch of platitudes with no actual policy or commitment behind them.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has taken Trumpâs polling gains seriously, though. In high-profile campaign speeches, ads, and statements, theyâve tried to remind voters âÂ and especially younger voters âÂ of his history of inflammatory statements and accusations of discrimination .\n\nâDonald Trump has spent his life and political career disrespecting Black men every chance he gets: he entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder, denigrated George Floydâs memory, and launched his political career trying to undermine the first Black president as the architect of birtherism,â Senior Biden Spokesperson Sarafina Chitikatold Semafor.\n\nVoters in their twenties today were children when Trump was leading his false birther charge against Barack Obama, a lengthy public crusade to prove that the first Black president was secretly born in Kenya and that his Ivy League pedigree at Columbia and Harvard Law School was nothing more than affirmative action. He dropped the issue just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nI brought the topic up with Trump in passing; he responded only in generalities about his broader record on issues like HBCU funding. But even some of his friends were stung by that one. Tyson told me he âdidnât agreeâ with Trumpâs Obama-bashing at the time, though he added he didnât let it affect their relationship. Walker chalked it up as âpart of this politics thing.â\n\nDemocrats are also hoping to capture the energy of four years ago, when the nation was engaged in large-scale protests against police brutality and racial inequality, a movement that notably also had broad buy-in from Black athletes in the major sports leagues. Trump condemned the Black Lives Matter movement in his debates with Biden and staged a photo-op outside the White House after riot police tear-gassed Lafayette Square. More recently, he bragged in a Time interview about how he had threatened protestors who âdesecratedâ monuments with 10-year minimum sentences.\n\nThen thereâs the âCentral Park Five,â a group of teenagers who were arrested in 1989 and charged with the rape of a jogger, prompting Trump to take out an ad calling to reinstate the death penalty. They were later exonerated âÂ one recently became a New York City Council member âÂ but Trump has never acknowledged their innocence. Their story is featured in Bidenâs campaign ads .\n\nWhen I spoke to Tyson, he said the topic still comes up when he tries to sell fellow celebrities on Trump.\n\nâThe only thing they can say is that heâs a racist,â he said. âCentral Park Five, other than that, they canât bring up anything else. And most of those famous Black people, they werenât saying that when he was getting them free tickets at the fight and getting them free rooms at the fight âÂ they werenât saying he was a racist then.â\n\nThat Trump is generous to his friends is part of the Democratsâ message, too. Theyâre arguing the former presidentâs sudden interest in discrimination as a smokescreen: Itâs not that he wants a more just legal system, itâs that he wants to abuse the law in order to protect himself, reward his allies, and punish his enemies.\n\nâWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?â Biden said at a Philadelphia event aimed at Black voters in May. âI donât think heâd be talking about pardons.â\n\nTrump has made tough talk on crime central to his campaign. But he also appealed to Black voters in 2020 by touting his work on the First Step Act, the most significant criminal justice reform package in years, and he boasted about granting clemency and pardons to some nonviolent drug offenders .\n\nThe politics of that movement have changed significantly since then. Following a crime surge in his final year in office, Trump began talking less about freeing prisoners on old drug charges, and more about executing drug dealers . A number of Trumpâs Republican primary challengers criticized the First Step Act and even suggested repealing it.\n\nSo I was at least somewhat surprised to hear Trump still sounded largely like it was 2020 when I raised these topics.\n\nâPeople have been treated very unfairly and itâs largely Black people,â he said. âItâs Hispanic people, itâs not just Black.â\n\nIn fact, he talked about expanding the First Step Act âÂ though itâs not clear how, and Trump has a history of promising policy rollouts that are always right around the corner.\n\nâWeâre going to be doing extensions of that,â he told me, adding that heâd release amendments for âstrengthening certain thingsâ while âworking on fairness.â\n\nIn some corners of the right, like Tucker Carlsonâs online show, thereâs been a renewed effort to defend Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota cop who killed George Floyd and is currently in jail for murder. Trump has pledged to âindemnify all police officers and law enforcement officialsâ if heâs re-elected, touching on a longstanding debate about whether police officers should be held personally responsible for their professional actions.\n\nHe has not elaborated on how broadly this policy should be applied, nor is it clear he has much ability to influence these cases at all. But he did tell me he believed Chauvin should not have been shielded from prosecution.\n\nâNo. What he did was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. That was crazy. When I looked at that â I watched that tape many times, no,â he said. âBut they have a lot of people that did a good job, and they were innocent. And you know, theyâve lost everything. Theyâve lost everything.â\n\nâSay hello to Don âÂ I love Don King,â Trump told me before we parted. âHeâs unbelievable. This guy was unique. There was never anybody like Don King.â\n\nAnd so after my visit to Mar-a-Lago, my nostalgia tour took me 45 miles south to Hollywood, Florida, where King was promoting his Fist of Fury boxing event.\n\nWhen I arrived for the weigh-in, King, 92 years old, was slumped in a wheelchair, though still strikingly tall. The light wasnât in his eyes like it used to be, but he could still pull off a look âÂ he was wearing one of his signature rhinestone denim jackets with an American flag design that heâs been photographed in many times before. With the assistance of his two grandsons, he was able to get on stage and stand just long enough to pose between boxers during their staredowns.\n\nKing wasnât in the mood to chat much, but his niece was there to help him get around. A self-described â Republicrat ,â he enthusiastically backed Trump in his prior campaigns and Jean King Battle told me her uncle has a lifesize cutout of Trump in their family room âbecause heâs family to my uncle.â When I approached him the next day, he seemed unaware we were scheduled to talk.\n\nBut Trump was right about one thing: The place had strong MAGA vibes and they were feeding off the testosterone in the room.\n\nâThatâs my nâa,â boxer Adrien Broner, 34, said when Trump was mentioned at the weigh-in. When I asked him to elaborate, he said, âTrumpâs the man. When Trump was in office, everybody was eating.â Dressed in a taxi-yellow sweatsuit with âWORK OR DIEâ on the back he added, âHeâs a man that means business. Just like me.â\n\nA promoter at the event, Egypt Brown, characterized Trumpâs allure in the boxing world as rooted in masculinity. âThey donât connect with Pride month as a fighter,â Brown told me. âThey donât connect with women fighting with men in their sport because itâs all about competition.â\n\nIâd heard similar things in Philadelphia just days earlier, when Republican Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt hosted a â Congress, Cognac, and Cigars â gathering at a smoking lounge to discuss Black male politics. Democratsâ emphasis on LGBTQ issues was helping drive Black voters to Republicans, Donalds said, while an audience member complained to me that feminism was leaving Black men behind.\n\nâThey intentionally promote the Black woman so she can look down on the Black man,â said Michael Blackwell, 60. âSo not only is society looking down at us, now the Black woman is because she got a hundred thousand dollars, got a career. Sheâs been conditioned to not need a man.â\n\nMy 1980s road trip through Donald Trumpâs star-studded world may wind up being a sideshow âÂ just another journalistâs half-futile attempt to understand the direction of the American public. Or it may be a kind of early warning system of something deeper.\n\nLeaders across the political spectrum are scrambling to channel the shifting politics of gender and a sense that men, in particular, have become alienated from the political system. Republicans have long argued that Black voters are more socially conservative than their vote indicates; their hope is that making elections a referendum on traditional masculinity will find a receptive audience.\n\nA big question is whether Trump has an operation ready to capitalize on his polling: The Biden campaign pointed to the newly revamped RNCâs struggles to nail their own program, including an initial decision to close minority outreach centers.\n\nTrumpâs effort is still in its early stages and has been stymied by a lack of direction, with no dedicated lead for ethnic and faith-based outreach. The campaign tapped Gina Carr to focus on Black outreach around the time of his South Bronx rally last month, which was touted as a show of his dedication to reaching nonwhite voters. But itâs still not clear the level of resources or scheduling the campaign plans to roll out, or whether it might release a targeted policy platform for Black Americans like 2020âs â Platinum Plan .â Lynne Patton, his senior advisor, said in a statement that his âpledge to Black Americansâ would be to âreinstateâ his old policies on issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nBut no one should assume Black voters are permanently immune to the kinds of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters âÂ that Trumpâs business success translates to success overseeing an economy, or that his personal problems equate to their personal problems, or that his distrust of the âdeep stateâ echoes their suspicions about government or media or corporations. Trump would hardly be the first candidate to try to beat an unpopular incumbent by feeding votersâ frustrations, avoiding policy specifics, and asking them to project their hopes on him.\n\nI asked Tyson about his interactions with ordinary people when it comes to Trump. He told me fans he meets are skeptical, but that his relationship with the former president makes them curious if theyâre missing something.\n\nâStreet people, they say âYo, I donât fâ with your man [Trump], but he loves you,ââ he said. âThey want to meet him. They ask me âwhat is he like?ââ\n\nAnd what does he tell them?\n\nâHeâs a people person,â he said. âThe common people voted him into office. It wasnât no big shot that voted him in office.â\n\nNot everyone buys the premise that Trumpâs gains with Black voters in polls will translate to the real world. While he has some concerns about younger voters, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher told me that about 14% of Black men have typically voted Republican in non-Obama cycles and heâs seen little in his own polling of likely voters âÂ and especially in recent election results â to indicate this will change in a major way.\n\nâ[There] is literally no evidence in actual voting that Black voters, including Black men, are somehow historically breaking Republican,â Belcher said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Study: HIV Rates in Gay Black Men Are Alarmingly High\n\nFollow @TIMEHealth\n\nA study of black gay and bisexual men in six U.S. cities finds that rates of HIV are increasing at a troublesome pace: each year, nearly 3% of gay black men become infected with HIV, a 50% higher rate than among their white counterparts.\n\nThe new-infection rate in gay black men under 30 is even higher, at 6% a year, according to the new data presented Monday at the annual International AIDS Conference in Washington, D.C. These numbers are comparable to HIV rates seen in sub-Saharan Africa, in countries that are hardest hit by HIV, the authors of the study note.\n\n\"This is extremely concerning,\" Kenneth Mayer, medical research director at Fenway Health, a leading HIV/AIDS clinic in Boston, and co-chair of the study, told USA Today . \"Here we are, this far into the epidemic, and we have these rates.\"\n\n( MORE: HIV Continues To Spread Among Gay Men )\n\nThe new numbers come from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study, conducted between 2009 and 2011, involved 1,553 gay and bisexual men from Atlanta, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe majority of the men in the study identified themselves as black. Not all the men identified themselves as gay or bisexual, but all the participants were having unprotected sex with men. More than 97% of men enrolled were willing to have an HIV test, and the results suggest that many men are not fully aware of their HIV risk: among those who thought they were HIV-negative or didn't know their status, 12% tested positive.\n\n\"The...study findings are a sobering wake-up call,\" said study author Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr in a statement .\n\n( MORE: Treatment as Prevention: How the New Way to Control HIV Came to Be )\n\nLast week, another new study [PDF] by the Black AIDS Institute also highlighted the alarming rate of infection among black men who have sex with men (MSM). While only 1 in 500 Americans is a black gay or bisexual male, they account for 1 in 4 new HIV infections in the United States, the report found. It also found that a black gay man has a 1 in 4 chance of becoming infected by age 25; by age 40, he has a 60% of becoming HIV positive.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that from 2006 to 2009, HIV infections among black gay and bisexual men under 30 increased 48% and that African Americans are overall disproportionately affected by HIV. Blacks make up 14% of the U.S. population, but account for 44% of all new HIV infections. According to 2009 data, 73% of new infections in black men are in gay and bisexual men.\n\n\"We have known that black MSM are affected by HIV at disproportionately higher rates when compared to other MSM in the U.S., but the [new study's] HIV incidence rates were extremely high,\" said study co-chair Dr. Darrell Wheeler, dean of the school of social work at Loyola University, in the statement. \"They make it very clear that we must urgently find and implement ways to stem the spread of HIV among black gay men in this country, and critically among young black gay men.\"\n\n( MORE: How the Global War on Drugs Drives HIV and AIDS )\n\nThe study found further that HIV risk among this population was associated with income and health overall. Those who tested positive for HIV were more likely to have another sexually transmitted disease (STD) and to be poor. USA Today reported:\n\nBoth increase the risk of disease transmission. STDs create inflammation that make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter the body. And because poor people generally have more problems getting health care, they're less likely to be tested, know their status and be on treatment, Mayer says. Recent studies show that effective treatment can make patients virtually non-contagious, and most AIDS researchers at the conference this week now seem to see \"treatment as prevention\" as the best hope for containing the disease.\n\nThe study reinforces the notion that fighting AIDS will involve more than just changing individual behavior, Mayer says. Research has consistently linked HIV infections with poverty, suggesting that the country needs to address \"structural\" issues, such as homelessness, discrimination and economic opportunity, Mayer says.\n\nMore than a million Americans are currently living with HIV, a high HIV rate that makes prevention efforts more difficult. As Mayer pointed out , prevention becomes even more problematic among the small population of gay black men who tend to date other men within their racial group and face even higher risks of being exposed to HIV.\n\nRecent data show that the disparities between black and white gay men don't come down to risky behavior. Blacks and whites tend to have similar numbers of sexual partners and are equally likely to to have risky sex. CDC data also suggest that the higher rate in black gay men isn't attributable to jail time or circumcision rates.\n\nFurther analysis of data from the HPTN study will focus on how behavioral and societal factors affect HIV risk in gay black men, including incarceration, childhood experience, social and sexual networks, discrimination and homophobia, and access to health care.\n\nMORE: Truvada: 5 Things to Know About the First Drug to Prevent HIV"

      "text": "Meet the Young Black Entrepreneurs Taking on Tinder\n\nJ ustin Gerrard speaks quickly, Brian Gerrard speaks slowly. Justin jumps around the room, Brian glides with caution. If you met them separately, you would never guess they were brothers. But their oil-and-water partnership helped them create Bae , a dating app for black people.\n\nBae works pretty much like Tinder, but tailor-made for black users. The Gerrards came up with the idea after they realized how difficult it is for black singles to find dates on existing platforms.\n\n\"If you are a black person, you see Tinder as a white app,\" says Brian. \"Tinder isn't calling itself the dating app for white people, but that is achieved implicitly because of the negative experience for black people.\" (Tinder spokesperson Rosette Pambakian said the dating app is among the most diverse global platforms in the world, and that \"everyone is welcome to use Tinder.\")\n\nIndeed, dating while black is not easy, especially on platforms largely populated by non-black users. The Gerrards cite an OKCupid study showing that black users experience a strong negative bias in online dating. In 2014, black women were 17% to 20% less likely to get responses from non-black men on OKCupid, while black men were 8% to 27% less likely to match with a woman of a different race. According to the OKCupid analysis, 82% of non-black men on the platform exhibit some form of racial bias against black women.\n\nThe problem can go far deeper than an inability to find dates. Brian says friends have shown him screenshots of \"being called a n-gger on Tinder. In 2016. In San Francisco.\" Phoebe Boswell, a Kenyan artist living in London, recently created an entire gallery show about the racist insults she has received on Tinder.\n\nTen years ago, the Gerrard brothers weren't thinking about starting a company together. They were too busy swordfighting. Their parents, both lawyers, sent the boys to separate private schools in suburban New Jersey. There, they both pursued fencing - Brian was ranked one of the top foil fencers in the state - and they frequently faced off against each another in tournaments, even though Justin is two years older. The brothers say their contrasting personalities have strengthened them as a team. \"It has made us more successful because of how we are able to combine those different skill sets,\" says Justin.\n\nNow the brothers Gerrard are both applying their skills toward Bae. The operation is based in Brian's small apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where basketballs roll around in the living room and old record covers hang on the wall. Their progress is tracked on a whiteboard, which lists the tasks of various team members and two questions scrawled in teenage-boy handwriting: \"What did you accomplish yesterday? What will you do today?\" There is beer in the fridge, an Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset near the TV, and the bathroom is what you would expect from a 20-something dude in Brooklyn. The Gerrards have three full-time and three part-time employees. They're not yet making money, but they hope to do so soon, perhaps through advertising.\n\nThere are some dating sites for black people, more in the Match.com vein, but not an app for young black users. Since the Gerrards launched Bae last April, the app's user base has grown to more than 100,000 people, roughly split between men and women (they won't give an exact user count). The Gerrards don't just want to create a hot app - they also want to help address the low marriage rates in the black community by making it easier for black singles to meet up. Pew found in 2012 that 36% of black people over the age of 25 had never been married, up from 9% in 1960. By comparison, 16% of whites over 25 had never been married.\n\nNon-black people aren't prevented from signing up for Bae, as the app doesn't ask your race when you create an account. But the idea is to create an app for black people to safely meet people of all races who want to form a genuine connection.\n\n\"It's shocking that there's a dating app for people who like bacon, there's one for burrito lovers, for Jewish folks, for Asians, there's Hinge and Bumble, but nobody wanted to solve this problem,\" Brian says. \"In hindsight, it makes perfect sense. People don't think about solving problems that don't affect them, and investors don't invest in ideas that don't affect them.\"\n\nIndeed, funding is one of the biggest obstacles facing many entrepreneurs of color. The Gerrards say they know of many white entrepreneurs who were able to get a head start through inheritance or, as Brian puts it, \"a quick friends-and-family round of $800,000,\" but black entrepreneurs rarely have that luxury. Bae received an angel investment last year before kicking off a seed round at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this month.\n\n\"Two generations ago if you were black in America, the best job you could have was post officer or schoolteacher,\" Brian says. \"So there's really no generational wealth to rely on.\" That means black entrepreneurs rely heavily on investors even for the earliest rounds of funding, which can be challenging given that most tech investors are white men.\n\n\"Nine times out of 10 if we're pursuing an investor, it is likely not somebody who has experienced what it's like to date as a black person in America,\" Brian says. Almost every black entrepreneur faces this challenge. Fewer than 1% of venture-backed startups are founded by a person of color.\n\nThe difficulty facing black entrepreneurs is obvious in the name of the product itself. That the Gerrards were able to trademark a phrase as common as \"bae\" and sell such a simple idea illustrates just how few startups are being created for black users. \"Bae\" has been part of the cultural vernacular for years, especially in the black community. It's been around so long that it was even declared \" over \" in 2014, after mainstream media outlets like this one took to explaining the term to old fogeys. But \"bae\" is such a common phrase, used by everyone from teens on Tumblr to Pharrell , that the Gerrards were shocked when they were able to use the word to name their app.\n\n\"It's crazy that we were able to trademark the word bae in 2015,\" says Brian, noting that the annual buying power of black consumers is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2020. \"It actually puts those particular investors at a huge disadvantage.\"\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com"

      "text": "The Little-Known History of the Black Men Who Became America's First Paramedics\n\nParamedics are lifelines in U.S communities, responding to all kinds of medical emergencies . And yet, the history of the emergency medical services (EMS) is little-known.\n\nIn American Sirens: The Incredible Story of the Black Men Who Became America's First Paramedics, author Kevin Hazzard, a former paramedic, spotlights the Black men in Pittsburgh who pioneered the profession and formed a model for emergency medical services that other cities copied.\n\nIn 1966, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published a white paper that was a damning indictment of the nation's emergency response system. \"Essentially, paramedics weren't plentiful enough to be there when you needed them and then weren't well trained enough to be of much use when they were there,\" Hazzard says.\n\nAmbulances were, in some cases, hearses that were driven by undertakers from the funeral home that would later plan the patient's funeral. In other situations, the sick and injured might be tended to by police officers or volunteer firefighters who were not trained to provide emergency care. Americans were more likely to survive a gunshot wound in the Vietnam War than on the homefront, according to the NAS report, because at least injured soldiers are accompanied by trained medics. \"In 1965, 52 million accidental injuries killed 107,000, temporarily disabled over 10 million and permanently impaired 400,000 American citizens at a cost of approximately $18 billion,\" the report said . \"It is the leading cause of death in the first half of life's span.\"\n\nThis lack of emergency care hit home for Peter Safar, an Austrian-born anesthesiologist at the University of Pittsburgh and a pioneer of CPR who helped to develop the modern hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He lost his daughter in 1966 to an asthma attack because she didn't get the right help between her house and the hospital. So he coped with the loss by designing the modern ambulance-including the equipment inside, plus its paint scheme. Perhaps most crucially, he also designed the world's first comprehensive course to train paramedics.\n\nThe first people to take the course in 1967 were a group of Black men who were in Freedom House, an organization that originally provided jobs delivering vegetables to needy Black Americans. At first the idea was to switch the delivery service from delivering food to driving people to medical appointments. But, within eight months, the drivers were trained to handle emergencies including heart attacks, seizures, childbirth, and choking. Their first calls took place during the uprising following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.\n\nAnd data showed that the training worked. One 1972 study of 1,400 patients transported to area hospitals by Freedom House over two months found the paramedics delivered the correct care to critical patients 89% of the time. By contrast, the study found police and volunteer ambulance services delivered the right care only 38% and 13% of the time, respectively. One Freedom House member, Nancy Caroline, wrote a textbook on EMS training that became the national standard.\n\nDespite the success of Freedom House, the city nixed the program in 1975. Pittsburgh Mayor Peter Flaherty thought he could create a better system and replaced Freedom House with an all-white paramedic corps. Hazzard tells TIME that he believes racism was at play. As he puts it, \"What other reason could he have for not wanting this organization, which was so successful and was a model around the country and around the world, other than the fact that they were an almost entirely Black organization.\"\n\nThe real story \"doesn't make the city look good,\" Hazzard says, so that's why he thinks the story of the nation's first paramedics is not better known. But Hazzard believes there are lessons in this story that are useful for all professions, not just paramedics. Many of the Freedom House participants went on to get master's degrees, Ph.D.s, or medical degrees-or pursued careers in politics or the upper echelons of police, EMS, and fire departments.\n\n\"These were really successful people who came from nowhere and where it all began was an opportunity in 1967,\" Hazzard says. \"All it took for a group of young men that the world had written off was one opportunity, and they never looked back from that point. Anyone can reach great heights. They just simply need a single opportunity.\"\n\nWrite to Olivia B. Waxman at olivia.waxman@time.com"

      "text": "Does The Bachelor Discriminate Against Blacks?\n\nAfter 16 seasons, there has yet to be a non-white bachelor on the show. Maybe it's time for a change\n\nChristopher Johnson talks with the media during a news conference to discuss his and Nathaniel Claybrooks' lawsuit against ABC's reality TV shows \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\" in Nashville, Tennessee April 18, 2012.\n\nFollow @TIMEIdeas\n\nIn the 1960s, people sued to desegregate lunch counters and universities. In April, a pair of black men challenged a different sort of institution they say remains a bastion of racial exclusion: ABC's The Bachelor . They asked a federal judge to order the dating show to cast a black lead. Last week, the judge threw the suit out on First Amendment grounds - which was the right thing to do. But just because the suit was a clear loser does not mean it will not have an impact.\n\nNathaniel Claybrooks and Christopher Johnson applied to be cast as the lead in the 2011 season of The Bachelor but they were turned down. That meant they missed out on the chance to receive a stipend, free food and housing, and travel expenses - and to have 25 women as exhibitionist as they are compete for their affections. The Bachelor may be mind-rottingly dumb - and its couples certainly have a poor track record of actually making it to the altar - but it is in its 16th season, so it clearly has a following.\n\n( MORE: Why Do We Care More About Diversity on TV Than in Our Schools )\n\nThe show boasts of its \"eclectic mix of bachelors,\" which have included \"a doctor, football star, prince, millionaire, [and a] single dad\" - presumably not the same person - but that eclectic mix has never produced a bachelor of color. The Bachelorette , its sibling show, has never had a bachelorette of color in its eight seasons. That makes the franchise 0 for 24. The overwhelming majority of the women and men competing for the bachelor and bachelorette's affections have also been white.\n\nClaybrooks and Johnson said that when they applied to be on the show, they were not seriously considered. Claybrooks said that when he went to a casting call in Nashville, all the other applicants appeared to be white, and while their interviews lasted about 45 minutes, his was ended after just 20 minutes.  Johnson said that when he arrived at a casting call also in Nashville, a white employee of the show took his materials and promised to \"pass them on\" to the casting directors, while white applicants were allowed in an given an interview.\n\n( MORE: Elizabeth Warren, Scott Brown, and the Myth of Race )\n\nThe two men accused the show's producers of intentionally avoiding casting black participants to avoid the subject of interracial dating - which could alienate the predominantly white audience. The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are, they argued, \"examples of purposeful segregation in the media that perpetuates racial stereotypes and denies persons of color of opportunities in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nThe two men charged that the show violated their rights under a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in forming contracts. They asked the court to order the show to stop discriminating, and to consider non-whites as finalists for the roles of bachelor and bachelorette.\n\nThe judge sided with the show's producers, ruling that their casting decisions are free expression protected by the First Amendment. The court invoked a 1995 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the organizers of a Boston St. Patrick's Day parade could keep out an Irish-American gay, lesbian and bisexual group, even though Massachusetts had a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supreme Court said that \"the speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message\" - a principle that applies to the producers of The Bachelor , as well.\n\n( MORE: Coming Out in Hip Hop: Frank Ocean's Powerful Moment )\n\nClaybrooks and Johnson may be wrong on the law, but they have a point to make on the facts.  The contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are far whiter than the country. The shows may be dreck, but television and pop culture shape public opinion. When Star Trek aired one of television's first interracial kisses , it chipped away at racial barriers. Vice President Joe Biden was right when he said on Meet the Press earlier this year that Will and Grace did a whole lot to change public opinion about gay marriage.\n\nEven if the First Amendment protects the producers' right to use casting decisions that bear an uncomfortable relation to social mores of Alabama in 1950, that does not mean it is the right thing to do. The lawsuit put an uncomfortable spotlight on the show's practices - and as NPR has pointed out , may well have had an effect. It appears that after seasons in which there have been no minority contestants , the next season of The Bachelor will have four black women. It is not exactly putting Thurgood Marshall or Sonia Sotomayor on the Supreme Court, but if we really want a society in which all groups are included, even our drivelly television should not discriminate.\n\nMORE: Why We Still Need Affirmative Action\n\nCohen, the author of Nothing to Fear , teaches at Yale Law School.

      "text": "Black Men With High Blood Pressure, See Your Barber?\n\nMid adult man getting his haircut in a barber shop and reading a newspaper\n\nFollow @TIMEHealth\n\nBlack men have the highest rate of hypertension-related death of any group in the U.S. (three times the rate of white men), partly because high blood pressure goes untreated in so many African Americans. To help remedy the problem - especially in patients who haven't sought a doctor's care - public health officials have long offered regular blood pressure screening at common places of congregation: churches, community centers and barbershops. Question is, do such interventions work?\n\nSome of these initiatives have been ongoing since the 1980s, but until now no one has done a systematic study of their effects. Now, a new study of 17 Dallas-area barbershops with primarily black clientele finds that when barbers offer free blood pressure screening and encourage patrons with high blood pressure to see their doctor, it helps people control their hypertension. ( More on Time.com: Want Good Health? There Are 10 Apps for That )\n\nIn the study, barbershops were assigned to be either an \"intervention\" shop or a control shop. In the intervention shops, barbers began with a 10-week baseline BP screening. Over the next 10 months, barbers offered clients BP checks with every haircut, and urged those with high blood pressure to see a doctor. They also gave clients referral cards to give their doctors with their latest BP readings. As extra motivation, the barbers were trained to tell clients \"model\" stories about other patrons who benefited from getting their hypertension under control.\n\nIf a hypertensive client had not seen a doctor by his next haircut, the barber would schedule an appointment for him. If the client then saw the doctor, he received a free haircut. ( More on Time.com: Why Are Black Bikers More Likely to Die in Crashes than Whites? )\n\nIn the control group, patrons were simply given a baseline screening and then were given a standard American Heart Association pamphlet about high blood pressure in African Americans.\n\nAt the end of the 10-month period, both groups successfully got clients to treat their blood pressure, but the rate of success in the intervention group was higher. Among the 695 clients with hypertension in the intervention group, the percentage who had brought their BP down to a safe level increased from 34% at baseline to nearly 54% 10 months later. Among the 602 men with high BP in the control group, that rate went from 40% to 51%. In the intervention group, 20% of hypertensive clients were on BP medication, compared with 10% of the control group.\n\nThe authors of the study note that widespread barbershop outreach could reduce heart attacks, strokes and death in the vulnerable black population, and save the health-care system millions. They write:\n\nIf the intervention could be implemented in the approximately 18,000 black-owned barbershops in the United States to reduce systolic BP...in the approximately 50% of hypertensive U.S. black men who patronize these barbershops [an estimated 2.2 million people], we project that about 800 fewer myocardial infarctions, 550 fewer strokes and 900 fewer deaths would occur in the first year alone, saving about $98 million in [coronary heart disease] care and $13 million in stroke care.\n\n\"What we learned from this trial is that the benefits of intensive blood pressure screening are enhanced when barbers are empowered to become health care extenders to help combat this epidemic of the silent killer in their community,\" said the study's author Dr. Ronald G. Victor of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles in a statement . \"Barbers, whose historical predecessors were barber-surgeons, are a unique work force of potential community health advocates because of their loyal clientele.\" ( More on Time.com: Why Do Black Patients Get Unwanted End-of-Life Care? )\n\nThe study , titled BARBER-1 (for Barber-Assisted Reduction in Blood Pressure in Ethnic Residents), was published online Monday by the Archives of Internal Medicine .\n\nMore on Time.com:\n\nThe Hispanic Mortality Paradox: Why Do Latinos Outlive Other Americans?\n\nThe 'Other' Salt: 5 Foods Rich in Potassium\n\nSpecial Report: Overcoming Obesity"

      "text": "Black Gay Men Are Still Invisible\n\nW henever I read about this mythical place in which a person's sexuality is no longer taboo, in the wake of a handful of states allowing marriage equality, I often think to check the balance of my credit card. I would love to be able to afford to go to such a wondrous place. Unfortunately, reality quickly smacks me upside the head. There's no way I could ever enter such a utopia - given that the only people allowed admittance are white, upper middle class white gay men. (Oh, and maybe the occasional straight \"ally.\")\n\nMonths ago, I read David Carr's essay in which he asserted \"now that gay marriage is a fact of life, a person's sexual orientation is not only not news, it's not very interesting.\" I chalked that up to him being a straight, white guy who didn't know any better. However, Brandon Ambrosino recently lent credence to Carr's possibly misguided remarks by noting , \"Carr's is a welcome reminder of the progress we often forget we've made. A person's gayness isn't a talking point, and his alleged gayness ought never be since it takes us back to an era when it was culturally acceptable to shame a gay person as a curious oddity.\"\n\nFor the record, it's still culturally acceptable to shame a gay person as a curious oddity. Otherwise, any conversation about a public figure's sexuality would reflect that on its own. What really bugs me about this conversation, and all those like it, though, is that marriage equality is often the sole basis on how to weigh progress.\n\nShould I meet the R&B singer or NBA player of my dreams, I'd love to get married and have all of the legal protections that come with that institution in all of the 50 states. Nonetheless, when I think about actual progress, as a gay Black man I can't be silly enough to base \"how far we've come\" on where I can get married. I can see same sex marriage being legalized nationwide - but at present moment, I have other things on my mind to worry about.\n\nWe can start with the one-sided representation of the LGBT community.\n\nAlthough Black people have traditionally been portrayed as the boogiemen and boogiewomen of gay rights (disproportionately opposed to gay marriage, on the whole), a Gallup poll nonetheless found that \"Blacks are more likely to identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender than any other racial or ethnic group in the nation.\" A year before that, the Census Bureau highlighted that gay couples \"in Southern states like Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are more likely to be raising children than their counterparts on the West Coast, in New York and in New England.\"\n\nAnd yet, who are the faces of gay families in the media? I recall Stephen Marche's review of the now cancelled NBC comedy, The New Normal, in which he claimed that, \"Gay people are becoming too boring for television.\" Well, maybe the ones we're stuck with are.\n\nAnd even when there is some diversity - e.g. the picture of two gay Black men raising children together that caused a stir recently - it comes from the Internet and is still framed with a disingenuous, \"Ohmigod, why are you talking about their race as if that matters?\" It's always the people who aren't subjected to scrutiny because of their color telling everyone else about the beauty of colorblindness.\n\nThe lack of effort to reach and represent other types of gay men has numerous consequences. For instance, take the New York Times report about Black and Latino men becoming the face of HIV. The story notes that \"there has been little political pressure to focus on young gay blacks and Hispanics.\" On the booming AIDS rates among minority gay men, Krishna Stone, a spokeswoman for Gay Men's Health Crisis, lamented, \"There wasn't even an ad campaign aimed at young black men until last year - what's that about?\" Phill Wilson, president of the Black AIDS Institute in Los Angeles, added that there are \"no models out there right now for reaching these men.\"\n\nBut again, someone's sexual orientation doesn't matter anymore because a few guys in New York and San Francisco have gotten married, which means the gay dudes living in New Orleans, Houston, and Atlanta just need to shut up and smile. The struggle is over now.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "The Question Bridge Project: Redefining Black Male Identity\n\nQuestion Bridge: Black Males is an innovative transmedia art project that aims to facilitate a dialog between black men from diverse and contending backgrounds and create a platform for representing and redefining black male identity. Conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas writes for LightBox about the ideas and motivations behind the project.\n\nLiving in mainstream society in the 21st century - a critical period in American history - requires us to constantly challenge and modify our behaviors, values and ideas about long-standing norms. In recent years, many people from traditionally marginalized communities have been able to transcend gender, cultural, racial, and economic boundaries, while others - African American men, in particular - have found themselves increasingly burdened with institutional constraints. Even with Barack Obama in the White House, many black men are still racially profiled; they are severely overrepresented in prisons; they suffer disproportionately from various preventable health risks and violent crimes. Even more disheartening is the level to which they are over-disciplined in the criminal justice system for the same offenses compared to \"whites\" convicted of similar crimes.\n\nQuestion Bridge was conceived by my collaborator, Chris Johnson, in 1996. Chris felt that art is \"too often considered to be something that can be valuable without being useful.\" The purpose of a Question Bridge is to use art to create a safe setting for honest expression, healing dialog and understanding within a community.\n\nOver the past five years, Chris and I, along with Bayeté Ross Smith, Kamal Sinclair, Jesse Williams and a growing team of artists have traveled the country and video-recorded nearly 1500 questions-and answer-exchanges from 160 self-identifying black men. We have created a video art installation that is traveling the country, a youth development curriculum and specialized community engagement events. We are currently developing an interactive website, a book and accompanying documentary. The project aims to spark a paradigm shift in consciousness around black identity that removes two critical obstacles facing the modern black male: exclusion from \"the other\" and estrangement from each other.\n\nA sample question from the project.\n\nThere is as much diversity within any demographic as there is outside of it. Why should anyone be confined to another's definition of who they are? The craziest thing about \"blackness\" is that \"black people\" didn't create it. Europeans, with a commercial interest in creating a sub- or nonhuman order of being that could be traded as a commodity, fabricated the concept of a \"black race.\" Nearly every virtue or characteristic ordinarily ascribed to human beings was stripped away as justification for the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The residue of this ancient mythology continues to corrode our discourse. Africa is a huge continent with hundreds of millions of souls, thousands of religions, histories, languages and cultures. Could such a galaxy of existences be reduced to a single, simple word? The persistent struggle for generations of Americans of African descent has been to turn a concept designed to relegate and regulate us into something beautiful and laudable. Millions have succeeded, but even more still fight the battle against implicit bias .\n\nThe depiction of black males through popular culture has long been governed by prevailing stereotypes about race and sexuality. Far too little is known about the range of internal values and dynamics of this group. Thousands of scientists, social scientists, theorists, historians, politicians and activists have investigated the \"plight\" of the African American male on various levels and from diverse perspectives, yet not enough has been done to create and find a multifaceted and, critically, a self-determined representation of this demographic. In some ways, the black male's greatest challenges reside within himself, and between other black men. The question is, \"why?\"\n\nQuestion Bridge: Black Males opens a window onto the complex and often invisible dialogs among African American men. \"Blackness\" ceases to be a simple, monochromatic concept, while the project urges the participants themselves to be at once the researchers and the subjects. Thus, not only the participants but the project's witnesses are freed to recognize each black man as an individual with limitless potential, released from the constraints of low-expectation stereotypes\n\nUltimately, however, in a very real sense, the project is not about black men at all. It's about what happens when people are put into groups, how they relate to the idea of the group and to others within it. This is a human experience. We live in a moment where we are outgrowing authoritative, grand narratives written by our \"leaders.\" Nearly every boundary has become permeable. We have a greater understanding of the value of each of our voices and the importance of listening to a variety of perspectives before forming our own conclusion about a given issue. Our greatest hope for this project is to complicate any simple definition of a group to the point where people no longer feel comfortable saying \"black men are...\" If we are successful in this broad endeavor, then we believe the Question Bridge methodology can be replicated and applied to address a broad range of human issues.

      "text": "Good News on Cancer Death Rates, Especially for Black Men\n\nFollow @TIMEHealth\n\nThe encouraging decline in deaths from cancer is continuing.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society's annual report, over the last 20 years, there's been a 20% drop in Americans' risk of dying of cancer. The researchers estimate that there will be 1,655,540 new cases of cancer and 585,720 cancer deaths in 2014. Lung, colon, prostate and breast cancers will account for the most fatal types of cancer.\n\nThe decline was especially dramatic for middle-age black men. In the last two decades, their death rates have been sliced by 50%. But because incidence and death rates from cancer among this group are among the highest in the nation, even with this drop, more black men continue to develop and die of cancer than whites or Asian Americans, who have the lowest rates of the disease.\n\nWhat's keeping rates so high among black men? They continue to have higher rates of prostate cancer than any other group in the U.S., and scientists have identified some gene variants that are more common among black men that are associated with an increased risk of the disease. Other factors, such as lack of health insurance, poor access to health care services, and lower screening rates, could also be contributing to the trend.\n\nOn the more positive side, the report found that one of the major factors contributing to dramatic drop in overall cancer risk for black men, is their lower rate of smoking.\n\n\"This was overwhelmingly driven by a combination of smoking cessation as well as black men not starting to smoke as teenagers in the 1960s, 70s and 80s,\" says Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical director of the American Cancer Society. \"People who started smoking in the 60s and 70s are really dying of lung cancer right now. For some reason this decline in black men was driven by a decline in death rate of lung cancer in black men.\"\n\nWhile anti-smoking campaigns have become more targeted to specific smoking populations, Brawley suspects that cost may be a more potent contributor to lower smoking rates among black men. \"One of the things that we found is that really has driven smoking rates down is the price of the cigarettes. It is conceivable that black men have been much more sensitive to the increasing cost of the price of cigarettes than white men,\" says Brawley.\n\nThat trend will hopefully continue and, Brawley hopes, contribute to more declines in smoking, and smoking-related cancers, among all ethnic groups. While the drops among black men are encouraging, he says, renewed focus on prevention efforts, such as regular cancer screening, could make the downward shift in cancer deaths even more dramatic in coming years."

      "text": "Unreasonable Fear Is Killing Black Men in America-And There's No Justification For It\n\nI f you closely follow the twists and turns in many of the most recent high-profile shootings of black men, you'll notice a pattern. First, only the slightest and smallest level of alleged misconduct or \"suspicious\" behavior is used to justify the killer's unreasonable fear.\n\nAnd second, even after the smoke clears, all too many members of the public will understand, forgive and perhaps even share that deadly terror. Americans still impose upon black men the burden of their own unbalanced sense of risk. The injustice of the singular act of the shooting is magnified by a collective acceptance and defense of the shooter's extraordinary alarm.\n\nThe pattern applies to the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. The known facts of the case are simple and startling. On the afternoon of Feb. 23, two Georgia men, Travis and Gregory McMichael, saw Arbery running past their home. According to the police report in the case, these men thought he looked like a suspect in recent breakins, so they armed themselves with a shotgun and a handgun and-along with a third man-gave chase in two vehicles.\n\nEventually they cornered Arbery. One vehicle drove behind him, its driver filming the encounter. The McMichaels' parked truck was in front of him, blocking his path forward. When he tried to run around the truck, Travis McMichael moved to intercept, holding his shotgun. Arbery and Travis scuffled, and the Georgia bureau of investigation said Travis shot Arbery, killing him.\n\nThe video was shocking. Why would these men arm them-selves and chase down a young man in shorts and a T-shirt who held no visible weapons? Gregory McMichael told police they thought he might be armed. Why? Because they'd seen him once put his hand down his pants.\n\nThat is the very definition of unreasonable fear.\n\nAs the case gained widespread public attention, evidence emerged that Arbery had likely been in a construction site shortly before he was shot. A 911 caller said he saw a man in an open, unfinished house. A video feed showed someone who looked like Arbery standing in the site. There was no immediate evidence that he committed a crime. He simply stood in an empty, open building-something countless curious Americans do as a matter of course.\n\nYet that very allegation, as innocuous as it is, was enough for some conservatives to come to the McMichaels' defense. For example, conservative commentator Tomi Lahren compared the claim that Arbery was \"just out jogging\" to the false claim that Michael Brown had his hands up when he was fatally shot in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nAnother conservative commentator, Candace Owens, attacked the claim that Arbery was \"just a jogger\" and said he was \"caught on camera breaking into an unfinished property.\" But even if true, that action in no way justifies an armed two-car pursuit, and it certainly doesn't permit private citizens to attempt to seize Arbery at gunpoint. That's not the only trivial action or suspicion that contributed to a deadly attack. I'll never forget the extraordinary statement of Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who shot and killed a young black man named Philando Castile during a traffic stop after Castile told Yanez that he was lawfully carrying a firearm. It's hardly unusual for a motorist to lawfully carry a firearm, and video of the encounter shows that Castile was complying with Yanez's instructions when he was shot. That same video shows Yanez rapidly escalating the encounter. What was one reason Yanez became so instantly afraid? Why was he so immediately convinced that a calmly speaking Castile was a deadly threat?\n\nBecause Yanez smelled marijuana. Yanez told investigators that if Castile \"has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the 5-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front-seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me?\" And lest anyone believe that Yanez's statement was too unreasonable to truly believe, re-call that a Minnesota jury acquitted him of second-degree manslaughter charges.\n\nThere are just too many tragic examples. Do you remember the killing of Walter Scott? He was shot in the back in 2015 by a South Carolina police officer named Michael Slager as Scott fled from a scuffle. He was unarmed. Why did the officer shoot an unarmed black man in the back? \"I was scared,\" Slager told the jury. He said that in his mind was \"total fear.\" A 33-year-old cop was terrified of a 50-year-old man running away.\n\nOne of the most traumatic fatal confrontations in recent U.S. history-the killing of Trayvon Martin-began when George Zimmerman called 911 to report that Martin \"looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about.\"\n\nThat was the sight that led an armed man to follow a teenager. There were no weapons visible (Martin was un-armed). There was no evidence of any criminality.\n\nWhen the case dominated public attention, a number of right-wing sites combed through Martin's history, publicized evidence of past drug use and speculated whether he was a drug dealer. They were looking for reasons to justify Zimmerman's pursuit. As Shermichael Singleton recalls in the Washington Post, Geraldo Rivera went so far as to identify Martin's hoodie as a material factor in his death. \"If he didn't have that hoodie on,\" Rivera argued, \"that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn't have responded in that violent and aggressive way.\"\n\nThe legal outcomes of these cases vary. A hung jury protected Slager before he pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights offense. Juries acquitted Yanez and Zimmerman. And the Arbery murder case is pending, the McMichaels having been arrested in May. Juries acquitted Yanez and Zimmerman. But each case was dominated by obvious, outsize perceptions of threat and danger.\n\nAnd, rather than rightly being seen as a badge of shame, the shooters' paranoia actually unites their defenders in righteous indignation.\n\nHow can this be? In part because a part of the U.S. population shares the same perceptions of threat as the shooters themselves. They look at the McMichaels and sympathize with their armed pursuit. They think it was just fine for Zimmerman to follow Martin. And if police officers felt afraid, who are they to second-guess the boys in blue?\n\nPut another way, there are Americans who would never pick up a weapon and try to track down a black man running on the street-or follow a young black man on a rainy night-but they understand and sympathize with those who do.\n\nThere is no easy cure for an unbalanced sense of risk. One can flood the zone with statistics about reduced crime. Juries can hold cowardly killers accountable. Outrageous video clips can raise awareness and slowly open eyes. But-at the end of the day-the battle is over the state of the human heart.\n\nMake no mistake. Hearts can change. There was a time when my own first instinct was to disbelieve that injustice and prejudice could still be so profound. Surely, I would think, there was a \"rest of the story.\" And yes, sometimes there was. Sometimes, initial reports of police or citizen misconduct were wrong.\n\nBut all too often those reports of mis-conduct were right. All too often they are right. In fact, those reports are right so often-with so many Americans defending the indefensible-that I realized that all too many of these cases carried with them a dreadful double injustice. There was the awful death itself. Then there was the public declaration that there was something right about the alarm and even terror that triggered deadly violence.\n\nIt's that second injustice that helps perpetuate the cycle of violence. It teaches a new American generation that when black men do even small things, then there is a reason to grab a gun-and even to fire that gun. The battle for hearts and minds must continue. It must be relentless and urgent-until at long last there is no real market for rationalization. After all, there is no reason a walk through a neighborhood at night or through an open construction site, or a whiff of marijuana in a car, should create in any American that terrible and fatal sense of unreasonable fear.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Why the Election Could Come Down to Black Men in a Few States\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nRaphael Warnock arrived on Detroit's Avenue of Fashion in his SUV, rocking blue jeans and a muted olive vest, ready to make his pitch to the predominantly Black audience. The Democratic Senator from Georgia is among a group of high-profile advocates for Kamala Harris working nonstop to turnout the Black male voters they fear could cost her the election-not so much by backing Donald Trump, but by not bothering to vote at all.\n\n\"We cannot afford to stay home. That's the real threat,\" Warnock said in a storefront hastily remade into a field office for Democrats. \"There's no such thing as not voting. If you do anything other than vote for Kamala Harris, then you are putting that man closer to the White House, and we cannot afford for him to be back in.\"\n\nWarnock's words were similar to his message earlier that day at a magnet school with a student body that is three-quarters Black and counts Diana Ross as an alumna. It's the same warning he's delivering daily up until Election Day in swing states, on talk radio, on TV, at HBCU homecoming games, everywhere, really-in hopes that the outcome isn't dictated by a lack of enthusiasm from low-propensity voters, especially Black men.\n\n\"I don't believe that there are going to be huge swaths of Black men voting for Donald Trump. I don't believe it,\" Warnock told a crowd at a downtown high school. \"We're not a monolith, like anybody else. There will be some; there have always been some.\"\n\nLow-propensity voters -those who are registered but far-from-guaranteed to show up on Election Day-have become the entire prize for Democrats at this late hour. Harris' advisers are making the strategic bet that her hardcore supporters have already banked their votes early where possible and that most of those inclined to back Trump aren't persuadable. Instead, the focus in the final push has been for those low-likelihood voters with knocks to their doors, with digital ads aimed at specific demographics, and unrelenting phone calls. On Saturday alone, Harris' campaign said they had volunteers in Pennsylvania knocking on 2,000 doors-each minute.\n\nThe Harris team has not tried to hide the aggressive effort to boost voter turnout-especially among Black men. And that effort is especially strong in key cities in the very, very white Blue Wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania-all of which look poised to be narrowly decided. Special effort has been made in markets like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Black voters are the spine of the Democratic Party, but efforts to ensure their support had, frankly, languished when Democrats thought they were stuck with President Joe Biden running for a second term. Once Harris took over the ticket in July, the team she inherited and then augmented went into overdrive to make up for the lost ground.\n\nIn 2020, Biden dominated in the Blue Wall states among Black voters, winning 92% each in Michigan , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . But they're only between 6% and 12% of the overall electorate, meaning a couple thousand Black voters who stay home can actually be the whole ballgame for Democrats. To keep those states, Harris requires turnout and discipline.\n\nIn the Southern states in play, it's more urgent; roughly 30% of the electorate in Georgia is expected to be Black, and 25% in North Carolina. Neither state is a must-win, but they're part of the seven-state constellation that is the most realistic map of battlegrounds. And in the last presidential race, Biden carried 88% of Black voters to win Georgia in 2020 but the 92% he won in North Carolina proved insufficient.\n\nFor her part, Harris has hardly played hard-to-get: she has released an Opportunity Agenda for Black Men and flooded Black media outlets and personalities. Aides have assembled events like a Black Men Huddle, Black Men For Harris, a barbershop tour called Cuts and Conversations, and targeted canvasses branded Step, Stomp, and Stroll. Musical acts like Beyoncé, Usher, John Legend, Lizzo, and Cardi B all have joined Harris events in the last month. Oprah, Stevie Wonder, and Magic Johnson have also been on hand. Actress Kerry Washington practically lives on the campaign trail these days, and the Congressional Black Caucus has been a roving roadshow for the campaign.\n\nOh, and a certain former President named Barack Obama and a First Lady named Michelle have come off the sidelines in major ways.\n\nIt's one of the most transparent and targeted efforts to reach these potential voters in recent years, and it still may come up short. Black men \"are not in our back pocket,\" Harris told the National Association of Black Journalists in September. Trump's strategists, of course, understand this and have been surgical in their campaign for young male votes across all racial groups. It's set in motion one of the most unexpected side-plots of the 2024 campaign.\n\n\"What you're seeing is the recognition by Kamala Harris-to her credit-that you can't take anybody for granted,\" Warnock tells me in a parking lot after one of many pep talks in Detroit. \"She knows that she's got a fight to earn the votes of Black men and white women and white men and every other constituency. And she's fighting to do that.\"\n\nCelebrity and identity politics can matter in voter registration and mobilization among low-propensity voters, for sure, but ultimately there has been a product beyond the packaging. Harris certainly does not lack for substance, but the energy radiating from her campaign at in-person events often fails to be felt from those consuming that content in clips and soundbytes. Her rally in Houston late last month rivaled any recent sporting or musical event in my mind, summoning memories of Obama's 2008 acceptance speech in Denver. (Beyoncé's introduction of her didn't hurt, either.) But from the outside, such moments can get drowned out by the daily buffet of Trump's outrageous bombast.\n\nStill, the messaging toward these voters has been a little disjointed at times. Many in Democratic circles questioned the wisdom of Barack Obama calling out Black men for being lukewarm on Harris out of latent sexism. (\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as President, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said in Pittsburgh.)\n\nSitting at a day before Election Day, Harris has strong footing in the polling. The final NBC News poll shows an 87%-9% split among Black voters, a blow-out for sure. But then it's worth remembering that Hillary Clinton had an 89%-8% lead among Black voters in 2016, too.\n\n\"If she doesn't win, it will be because of racism. It's that simple,\" says Keith Williams, the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus and a former Wayne County Commissioner. \"She's running against a convicted felon who doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's still close. There's only one way to explain that.\"\n\nRetired engineer John Watkins, who took a minute out of his Friday to hear from Warnock and to pick up Harris yard signs, had a slightly different opinion. \"People aren't taking Trump seriously around here,\" the 67-year-old Detroit resident says. \"Half of the country is just not going to vote for a Black woman. We have to remind ourselves of that reality and work twice as hard.\"\n\nDemocrats remain skittish about the Black male vote, but are less worried than they were around Labor Day. An NAACP poll released last week found Black men under age 50 were coming home to the Democratic Party; Trump's support fell from 27% to 21% from a month earlier. Meanwhile, Harris' support climbed from 51% to 59%-still a challenge in a voting bloc that any Democrat need to run up tallies.\n\nOverall, among all Black voters, Harris enjoys about 73% support in the NAACP poll-also up from a month earlier by about 10 points. By comparison, Biden earned the vote of about 90% of Black voters in 2020, and Obama won about 95% of those ballots in his two campaigns.\n\n\"It's better, but not good,\" says one veteran strategist cheering his friends from outside the Harris campaign. \"We are out of the Biden danger zone but this is still going to come down to what our aunties say at church that last weekend.\"\n\nSo, as Warnock-like so many other Harris allies in the campaign's final days-repeats his pitch to every group of potential voters he can find, it's one rooted as much in aspiration as pragmatism.\n\n\"You will not see waves of Black men voting for Donald Trump,\" Warnock insisted. \"The real threat that we face, the real thing that we've got to address is apathy.\"\n\nThat, right there, is why Harris' team has spent the last weeks of the campaign in overdrive, and will stay there until the last polling locations close in just a few hours. They aren't looking for the die-hard partisans, they're looking for the indifferent Americans who might not even know Election Day is finally upon us.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "'Much more than the running': Knoxville's Black Men Run movement pairs networking with action\n\nThere's an invisible health crisis facing American Black men. But in Knoxville, they are doing something about it.\n\nThey're running for our lives literally, they say.\n\nPhillip Tucker, a licensed mental health professional and Austin-East Magnet High School alum, started the first Knoxville chapter of Black Men Run , a national running group focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"I'm a runner, and there's not a lot of Black representation here in the Knoxville running the community, despite how large it is. There's just not a lot of us,\" Tucker told Knox News.\n\nAfter joining the Black Men Run organization's Facebook group, he said the local chapter came to be after a national representative gauged his interest in bringing it to Knoxville.\n\n\"It took off from there,\" he said.\n\nSince the group's inception in September, about eight men take part in the weekly runs at Victor Ashe Park, and the group hopes to attract more runners to get involved. But the turnout isn't stopping them from collectively coming together and taking advantage of all the benefits of physical activity and camaraderie.\n\n\"We've got guys who are out there all ages, with kids, grandkids, married, single and just interested in taking care of their health,\" Tucker said.\n\nEven better, the group's mission has produced results.\n\n\"We've got a diabetic in the group and every week he's coming in talking about having fewer symptoms. Since he started actively participating in the group, his sugar levels subsided and his energy increased. That's what it's all about. Just seeing guys come out and bond with other Black men and see the results in their daily lives,\" he said.\n\nRacial disparities in men's health in the U.S. are well documented, with consistently higher prevalence and poorer outcomes observed in Black males across the age spectrum - from unintentional and violence-related injuries at the lower end to chronic illnesses at the upper end, according to the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.\n\nBlack men have the highest age-adjusted, all-cause mortality rate and arguably the worst health status of any race/gender group in the U.S.\n\n\"Our numbers are terrible when it comes to our health. When it comes to hypertension, diabetes, depression. And there's a discrepancy in the culture in terms of us addressing our mental health, but it applies to other aspects of our health as well,\" Tucker said.\n\nBlack Men Run is creating that space where runners can begin to address these health issues in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or daunting. It's just a jog, after all.\n\n\"Whether they want to run, walk, train for marathons, everybody feels comfortable and we don't leave anybody behind,\" he said.\n\nSean Powell, 51, a UT Police Department senior officer and group member, told Knox News that, for him, the group is simply about Black men coming together during a time it's needed most.\n\n\"The commonality of being in shape and expressing our love toward each other as Black men should be a part of life. It's about much more than the running,\" Powell said.\n\n\"This is also helping us as Black men to be vulnerable because we are conditioned in society on how we are supposed to be as men. It's valuable to be able to tell another Black man what you are going through because so many of us are going through the same struggles.\"\n\nTucker says that the group is creating a social space that Black Knoxvillians have been missing.\n\n\"It's hard to find places to find other like-minded Black people. We have the barbershop for us as Black men and that's about it. This is intentionally a place where people can come to get healthy but also build healthy connections and network,\" he said.\n\nThe Knoxville chapter meets to run at 8 a.m. each Saturday at Victor Ashe Park. Tucker said all are welcome and that they plan to have more runs and activities in the near future.\n\n\"We are coming together for a unified purpose, guys of all ages and from all different walks of life. If it weren't for this chapter we might not even talk to each other out on the streets with the culture being what it is. We might get a head nod. But out here we are brothers, we are supporting each other, and it's just a beautiful thing.\""

      "text": "Season for Sharing: 100 Black Men of Indianapolis seeks to nurture successful Black youth\n\nMustapha Baryoh was a teenager when he was pulled over by a police officer for the first time for speeding.\n\nSitting in his vehicle, the young Black man recalled his education as a participant of 100 Black Men of Indianapolis just the year before. The training he received in the nonprofit's Beautillion Militaire program included a session on how to interact with law enforcement.\n\n\"I was relatively comfortable in an anxiety-filled situation,\" said Baryoh, now a 27-year-old Chicago resident. \"We were able to sort of simulate that engagement with law enforcement a year before I was in that situation, so I was able to sort of handle it effectively as a Black man.\"\n\nRecalling the training's emphasis on staying calm and getting home safe, Baryoh drove away safely with a ticket.\n\nThe local chapter of 100 Black Men has been around since 1984 but stems from a national organization created in New York City in 1963 amid a decade of civil and racial unrest.\n\nOne of the organization's founders, former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, died just last month, but its programming is still pertinent more than 50 years later as the city and nation face another reckoning over racial injustice and inequality.\n\nIn Indianapolis, the nonprofit's programs extend from pre-kindergarten through college and beyond, connecting students with role models to prepare them for a successful adulthood.\n\nWhen Baryoh took his current job as a financial analyst right out of college in Chicago and was shortly asked to work in Zurich, Switzerland, he still looked to his mentor James Duke, president and CEO of the nonprofit's board of directors, for guidance.\n\n\"He sort of framed this as the experience of a lifetime,\" said Baryoh, who was overwhelmed with the decision. \"And so from there, my attitude and my mindset completely changed, where I was more open toward the experience - and it ended up being one of my most favorite experiences in my lifetime.\"\n\nMentors from 100 Black Men guide male elementary and middle-school students in roughly four public schools, serving as a role model to help them navigate through tough life decisions.\n\nThe Beautillion Militaire program, meanwhile, encourages male high-schoolers to come up with a \"man plan\" - a guiding document for how they plan to spend their life.\n\nBut the nonprofit's efforts aren't just limited to boys. Its 100 Summer Academy serves girls and boys through eighth grade to prevent academic slide over the summer. The weekly financial literacy program teaches high-schoolers the benefits of investing in the stock market. The robotics program for elementary and middle-school students teaches teamwork.\n\nAnd even once they are in college, students can still seek guidance on time management, study habits and networking through the Collegiate 100 program - while also giving back and becoming a mentor themselves.\n\nThis year has been challenging for the organization. As Indianapolis witnessed the fatal police shooting of Dreasjon Reed - a former participant, Duke says - the pandemic has made it harder to connect with students during a nationally tumultuous time.\n\n\"We are finding ourselves trying to do better check-ins with each other and with our students to make sure that they're OK,\" Duke said. \"Because we know that with all that's been going on from a health perspective, from a political perspective, from educational, workforce perspective, everything is off-kilter.\"\n\nMentors have connected with students who went through the program with Reed, helping them process the events of the year.\n\nTheir advice, Duke said: There is a time and place for everything.\n\n\"We also help them understand that there are multiple places where people can make an impact,\" he said. \"So there's a place for people who are out protesting, but there's also a place for people who are at the Statehouse to make an impact from that level.

      "text": "'Brothers Size' follows spiritual odyssey of three black men\n\nIn the afterglow of last year's \"Moonlight,\" Tarell Alvin McCraney is best known as the guy who shared Oscar honors for best adapted screenplay.  But before the 37-year-old McCraney picked up his hardware in Tinseltown, he'd already won a MacArthur \"genius\" grant for his exceptional work as a playwright.\n\nThe centerpiece of that growing body of work is \"The Brother/Sister\" plays, a trilogy set in a fictional town on the edge of the Louisiana bayou.  While often presented together, each play stands on its own. The best of them, \"The Brothers Size,\" opens next weekend at Milwaukee Chamber Theatre, in a production directed by Marti Gobel.\n\nIt will be the first fully professional production of a McCraney play in Milwaukee.  But it's not our first exposure to McCraney's stage work.\n\nThree years ago, Gobel directed \"In the Red and Brown Water,\" in a collaboration between Marquette University and Gobel's now-defunct UPROOTED Theatre.  It landed on my top ten list of best plays seen anywhere in Wisconsin in 2014.  Three months later, Gobel and UPROOTED staged a memorable reading at Next Act of \"The Brothers Size.\"\n\nAs \"Size\" begins, younger brother Oshoosi Size (Andrew Muwonge) and his friend Elegba (Marques Causey) have just been released from prison.  Oshoosi is crashing with older brother Ogun Size (Travis A. Knight), who owns a small auto repair shop.\n\n\"Ogun is very solid and a hard worker, intent on being responsible and taking care of everything,\" Gobel said during a pre-rehearsal interview.  \"Oshoosi wants to go out and see the world.  Elegba tempts Oshoosi to explore.  He's slithery, and he can bite.  But he's also beautiful and smooth.  His ultimate goal is to help Oshoosi find his best self.\"\n\nGobel likened Elegba to Kevin in \"Moonlight\"; while flawed himself, Elegba nevertheless challenges Oshoosi to find and follow his path, in a world where black men's dreams are continually deferred and damaged.\n\nAs is true with the characters in \"Moonlight,\" the trio in \"The Brothers Size\" are all presented as so much more than their poverty and their rap sheets.  True to their names - drawn from the Yoruba mythology that's integral to African-American folklore - each of them is both a flesh-and-blood person and a god.\n\n\"McCraney's world involves African-Americans who are gods that occasionally forget themselves and their true path, much like the gods in Greek mythology,\" Gobel said.  \"And by dwelling within us, these gods connect us to our Yoruba ancestors, who continue to watch over us even if they can't physically be with us.\n\n\"That means that on the north side of Milwaukee, there are gods walking among us that we don't see. We make faulty assumptions based on where we are in the city - or based on the color of someone's skin - regarding who a person is and how much they know.\n\n\"But if you really hold tight to the idea that the gods can be in us and around us and guide us, life's moments of realism would continually be informed by moments of mysticism.\"\n\nGobel's production will reinforce this sense of the often unseen gods living around and within us through a fourth character. Even as he embodies the Yoruba god Egungun, Drummer Jahmés Tony Finlayson will be dressed as a homeless man sitting upstage, making drums from found objects such as trash cans, bunt pans and bowls.\n\n\"I don't know how you could do these plays without a live drummer,\" Gobel said, noting that she'd also used live, onstage drumming in her production of  \"In the Red and Brown Water.\" \"McCraney writes with such a rhythm, in poetic language that has such evident emotion.  The drum accentuates that.  It drives the story forward.\"\n\nThat story travels backward to Africa and forward toward a day when the gods dwelling within every black man might stand tall. \"I just want to find something like you got,\" Oshoosi says to his big brother, who loves fixing cars and being a mechanic.  \"Go find you,\" Ogun tells him, even as he worries that setting his little brother free means losing him.\n\nTaken on its most modest, realistic level, that push and pull between brothers is a coming-of-age story, involving the tension between family and freedom, the past and the future, home and the open road - symbolized, here, by the car in which Elegba and Oshoosi go cruising.\n\nBut such journeys in McCraney are never just physical.\n\nSuch travels also involve a state of mind, often best seen in this piece through characters' dreams.  True to a writer who isn't afraid to be surrealistic, those dreams will transport us into a mystical realm - worlds removed from a set that will prominently feature Ogun's garage as well as a bus-stop bench and an urban park's bleachers.\n\nPatrons can purchase seats allowing them to watch the play from the onstage bench or bleachers; the rest of us will be enveloped by a large tree, akin to a weeping willow and stretched like a canopy over the audience.  \"Everybody will be sitting under a tree, on a bench, or in bleachers, included in this world and challenged to see it differently,\" Gobel said.\n\nBut even as we travel to the fictionalized community of San Pere, La. - a name underscoring all the missing fathers in McCraney's work - the men living there will be dreaming of Africa.  McCraney sets his play in the \"distant present\"; as Gobel recognizes, he thereby imagines a utopian future that also incorporates - rescues, really - what's best about the past.\n\nAs we spoke, Gobel invoked that promised land by referring to a beautiful moment in the play during which Oshoosi tells his older brother about a book he'd stumbled upon while in prison.\n\nThe book is filled with pictures of Madagascar - \"the people, the places, the water, the eating, the ground, the earth.\"  All of it, Oshoosi tells Ogun, reminds him of himself, no longer surrounded by \"faces telling me what's wrong with me.\"\n\n\"I need to be out there looking for the me's,\" Oshoosi says.  \"He got something to tell me man.  Something about me that I don't know.\"\n\nAs with \"Moonlight\" and so many of his plays, McCraney is continually searching to remember and revive all that these characters once knew and have now forgotten about themselves, given all the ways their heritage and history have been broken or bent.  Like Oshoosi, he's driven by a utopian impulse, involving black America's ongoing journey toward the promised land.\n\n\"This road is rough,\" we're continually told in the prologue to the play.  But \"The Brothers Size\" walks it with hope and love, in some of the most gorgeously poetic language written by any American playwright this side of Tennessee Williams.\n\n\"We're already on the path,\" Gobel said.  \"And McCraney's poetry keeps you going, in a particular direction.\"\n\n\"The Brothers Size\" runs from Feb. 21 to March 18 at the Broadway Theatre Center, 158 N. Broadway.  For tickets, visit www.milwaukeechambertheatre.com."

      "text": "Season for Sharing: 100 Black Men of Indianapolis seeks to nurture successful Black youth\n\nMustapha Baryoh was a teenager when he was pulled over by a police officer for the first time for speeding.\n\nSitting in his vehicle, the young Black man recalled his education as a participant of 100 Black Men of Indianapolis just the year before. The training he received in the nonprofit's Beautillion Militaire program included a session on how to interact with law enforcement.\n\n\"I was relatively comfortable in an anxiety-filled situation,\" said Baryoh, now a 27-year-old Chicago resident. \"We were able to sort of simulate that engagement with law enforcement a year before I was in that situation, so I was able to sort of handle it effectively as a Black man.\"\n\nRecalling the training's emphasis on staying calm and getting home safe, Baryoh drove away safely with a ticket.\n\nThe local chapter of 100 Black Men has been around since 1984 but stems from a national organization created in New York City in 1963 amid a decade of civil and racial unrest.\n\nOne of the organization's founders, former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, died just last month, but its programming is still pertinent more than 50 years later as the city and nation face another reckoning over racial injustice and inequality.\n\nIn Indianapolis, the nonprofit's programs extend from pre-kindergarten through college and beyond, connecting students with role models to prepare them for a successful adulthood.\n\nWhen Baryoh took his current job as a financial analyst right out of college in Chicago and was shortly asked to work in Zurich, Switzerland, he still looked to his mentor James Duke, president and CEO of the nonprofit's board of directors, for guidance.\n\n\"He sort of framed this as the experience of a lifetime,\" said Baryoh, who was overwhelmed with the decision. \"And so from there, my attitude and my mindset completely changed, where I was more open toward the experience - and it ended up being one of my most favorite experiences in my lifetime.\"\n\nMentors from 100 Black Men guide male elementary and middle-school students in roughly four public schools, serving as a role model to help them navigate through tough life decisions.\n\nThe Beautillion Militaire program, meanwhile, encourages male high-schoolers to come up with a \"man plan\" - a guiding document for how they plan to spend their life.\n\nBut the nonprofit's efforts aren't just limited to boys. Its 100 Summer Academy serves girls and boys through eighth grade to prevent academic slide over the summer. The weekly financial literacy program teaches high-schoolers the benefits of investing in the stock market. The robotics program for elementary and middle-school students teaches teamwork.\n\nAnd even once they are in college, students can still seek guidance on time management, study habits and networking through the Collegiate 100 program - while also giving back and becoming a mentor themselves.\n\nThis year has been challenging for the organization. As Indianapolis witnessed the fatal police shooting of Dreasjon Reed - a former participant, Duke says - the pandemic has made it harder to connect with students during a nationally tumultuous time.\n\n\"We are finding ourselves trying to do better check-ins with each other and with our students to make sure that they're OK,\" Duke said. \"Because we know that with all that's been going on from a health perspective, from a political perspective, from educational, workforce perspective, everything is off-kilter.\"\n\nMentors have connected with students who went through the program with Reed, helping them process the events of the year.\n\nTheir advice, Duke said: There is a time and place for everything.\n\n\"We also help them understand that there are multiple places where people can make an impact,\" he said. \"So there's a place for people who are out protesting, but there's also a place for people who are at the Statehouse to make an impact from that level. There's a place in the courtroom. There's people who are needed to make sure that policies and such are put in place.\"\n\nThe goal is to positively advance the outcome and development of youth, Duke noted.\n\n\"The professional men in the community at that time, back in the '60s with all the civil unrest that was going on, they wanted to be able to provide positive role models for youth in the community,\" Duke said. \"To give them something to strive for, something to look at for success.

      "text": "First-in-the nation school program turns boys into strong black men\n\nThe Detroit Free Press spent a year listening to Detroit's children, trying to understand their experiences - as many face violence, trauma and instability. With help from a grant from the Solutions Journalism Network, we looked both in our own backyard and around the country for solutions that may help children deal with the \"toxic stresses\" in their lives. Catch up with the series here . Here is how we did the project .\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. - When it launched the Office of African American Male Achievement in 2010, the Oakland Unified School District became the first in the nation to create a department to specifically address the needs of a population it considered most at risk: African-American boys.\n\nThe Manhood Development Project is the signature program of the office, and it combines academic mentoring, motivational psychology, character education and an Afrocentric curriculum to raise academic performance. The class is an elective, but it fills up quickly.\n\n►Helping children: Shift in view of black males a goal, too ►Helping children: Girls, Asians, Latinos not left out\n\nThe teachers in the program are all African-American men.\n\n\"It's been a huge lift for this campus to have a brotherhood on campus as part of the regular school day,\" said Olafemi Bankole Akintunde, one of the teachers at Westlake Middle School. \"It's not an after-school program. It's a regular course. It's really designed for them to feel empowered.\"\n\nThe program began in three schools and has expanded to 24, serving more than 800 students in grades 4-12. Officials, pleased with its success, plan to expand its approach to other populations: African-American girls and Latino and Asian students.\n\nIn high school, where students learn Afrocentric literature, the class counts as credit toward English language arts.\n\nTopics in the classrooms range from African history to NBA basketball to trouble at home or in the neighborhood. The classes - a give-and-take between students and teacher - are made up of students at different academic levels.\n\nAbout one-third are high-achieving students, another third are average students and the remainder are kids struggling in class. That breakdown sometimes varies, but the one-third rule was set as a goal.\n\n\"What we found was that kids who really knew how to navigate the streets were helping the kids who were doing really well in school actually get home safely,\" said Christopher Chatmon, executive director of the office. \"And those kids who were doing really well in school were helping those other kids.\"\n\nSince the program began, statistics show that:\n\n\"We're still not where we need to be, but we're able to establish and set up targeted strategies for African-American males,\" Chatmon said.\n\nThe program grew out of a 2009 task force created to examine disparities in Oakland schools. It targeted African-American males because data showed them to be the group most in need.\n\nBlack males ranked lowest among student groups in academic performance and graduation rates. They also were suspended and referred to special-education programs at rates so disproportionate to their share of the student body that the U.S. Department of Justice filed complaints over the disparate treatment.\n\nThe approach taken in Oakland is similar to one taken by a handful of schools in Detroit that use an African-centered curriculum. A 2005 governor's Transition Team report recommended expanding the use of such a curriculum in Detroit schools, where African-American boys score slightly lower than African-American girls in key areas such as English language arts, math, science and social studies, according to the most recent test data available. Both groups perform below the state average.\n\nIn Akintunde's class, hip-hop music pulses as a dozen  eighth-graders file into the classroom, take their seats and begin writing in their journals.\n\nMoments later, the music dies and their teacher leads the students, all teenage boys, in reciting a pledge he wrote himself. The pledge calls for the students to respect their mothers, sisters, brothers and themselves in a sense of common brotherhood.\n\n\"We are young men ready to lead and achieve our goals of becoming a man,\" the boys say in unison.\n\nAfter the students recite the daily affirmation and settle into their seats, they write the word of the day - \"gratitude\" - and its definition in their journals.\n\nA board near the front of class lists words from previous days: persistence, integrity, growth, truth, patience, courage and love.\n\nAkintunde has them write down five things for which they are grateful. Students describe things such as family, food, music, sports. One boy mentions forgiveness.\n\n\"Forgiveness is huge,\" Akintunde tells the class. \"Forgiveness refers not just to receiving forgiveness but giving it, and even forgiving yourself.\"\n\nLater, the class writes down the quote of the day: \"The will to succeed is nothing without the will to prepare.\"\n\n\"You have to put in effort and work to get what you want,\" Akintunde says. He asks the students to explain what the quote means and presses them to go deeper after they provide superficial answers.\n\n\"I'm going to have to go submarine, go scuba on you,\" he says.\n\nFinally, a student describes willing himself to get to school on time by running.\n\n\"If you walked, you weren't going to make it, so you used your willpower to usher you on to school,\" Akintunde says approvingly. \"If you don't have (the) will to put together a plan, it doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nAkintunde then asks students to begin drawing up a plan to succeed over the summer, with an emphasis on working on their weakest academic subjects and staying out of trouble. A group of students discusses run-ins with one particular teen and how to deal with him. Some suggest inviting the adversary to join them in a game of basketball.\n\n\"You're trying to get him to play basketball with you as opposed to getting into this type of argument with you. Is that right?\" Akintunde asks. \"OK. So brothers, what you are all just saying is a solution to an issue or a problem that could occur this summer. And you all being together and looking out for one another, that's really important.\"\n\nNadine Jenkins, whose son, Ernest Jr., is an eighth-grader in the program, said she has seen a difference in her son since he joined. He was chronically shy but has come out of his shell, she says.\n\n\"His ability to communicate is day and night. I was impressed with that. When he needs to speak out, he speaks out. I'm sure a lot of that came from class. I'm very proud. I like that.\"\n\nAkintunde, 32, grew up in Oakland when crack cocaine was ravaging the community.\n\nIn class this day, he wears cargo shorts, a black T-shirt and sneakers. Last fall, he began his classes by showing students one of his high school report cards, with six F's on it. His life experiences gives him a credibility with students.\n\n\"I got kicked out of two high schools for truancy issues,\" Akintunde said. \"I tell them, 'I've experienced everything you've experienced.' \"\n\nAkintunde said he barely graduated and hung around a bad crowd.\n\n\"I was with the wrong people at the wrong time, and I had a very harsh experience,\" he said.\n\nBut he was able to turn around his life. He decided to go to college and became the first member of his family to graduate from college, earning a sociology degree. He spent several years performing with a west African culture group that included music and acting, elements he uses every day in his class.\n\n\"It's not just me talking at them,\" Akintunde said. \"It's more of this audiovisual engaging conversation that we're having. We're on a journey together.\"\n\nHe talks often about his wife and sometimes brings his daughter to class. He does it, in part, to teach his students that they should protect and defend women and girls from others who would disrespect them.\n\nThe program emphasizes an Afrocentric curriculum and teaches the history of Africa and its people.\n\n\"We don't start with slavery,\" Akintunde said. \"I showed them a lot of cities in Africa right now that are flourishing that are actually more technologically advanced than some of the cities out here.\n\n\"For them, it was like, you know, all I see is 'feed the hungry' commercials, people on TV with swollen bellies and flies on their eyes and all that other good stuff,\" he said.\n\nThis year, students researched and wrote about an African king or queen from history. The idea was to remind them that not all Africans were slaves.\n\nChatmon said the curriculum helps students recognize the potential greatness in themselves.\n\n\"We refer to them as 'kings,' \" Chatmon said.\n\nThe reading list includes works from and about James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, Alex Haley and Marcus Garvey.\n\nThe program was developed after organizers met with parents seeking ideas.\n\n\"The one that really gripped the public school system was this idea of identifying, recruiting and training African-American male teachers and then placing them in a classroom setting Monday through Friday with cohorts of African-American male students,\" Chatmon said.\n\n\"That has been one of the successes,\" said Bobby Pope, a caseworker who counsels students in the program. \"They see someone who looks like them who is successful, who is emphasizing education. They just haven't seen a lot of that.\"\n\nKeeto Gaines is just 14, but he has already dodged gunfire on several occasions. Once, he took cover behind a playground Dumpster. Another time, he ducked to the sidewalk with his mother as a gunfight played out between two speeding cars on the street. On the night of his 14th birthday, he was at his father's apartment when he heard gunfire outside.\n\nInstinctively, he grabbed his younger stepbrother, raced to the kitchen in the back of the apartment and lay flat on the floor in front of the stove.\n\n\"I have a good feeling of where to hide during gunshots, where the safest place is,\" Keeto said.\n\nOn that night, March 21, the gunfire stopped, and no one in his home was hit. A man sitting in a car parked next door was hit and left in an ambulance.\n\nIt was a school night, but Keeto lay awake past 1 a.m., anxious about the shooting and unable to fall asleep. The blue strobe lights of the police cruiser outside flashed across the ceiling.\n\nThat night, he called his mother to tell her about the shooting and penned a letter to Akintunde.\n\n\"I love being an African man because there is nobody in the whole world like me,\" the letter began. \"We are the only people who have a lot of melanin in our skin, but there are also many stereotypes that break us down. But we as a people have to work together to break them.\"\n\nKeeto held onto the letter until the end of the semester. Akintunde said he was moved to tears when he read it.\n\n\"For me, that was really powerful to hear,\" he said.\n\nKeeto said that he has grown close to Akintunde.\n\n\"He's like a male version of my mom,\" Keeto said. \"They both rap. They are both into African-American civilizations, culture, history.\"\n\nKeeto's mother, Barbara Shingleton, 39, was with her son once when he encountered violence. It was early December 2015; they were near a bus stop at 73rd Avenue and Bancroft when they heard gunshots. Men in two cars were firing back and forth as they raced down the street toward Shingleton and her three children.\n\nOne of the cars ran a red light, struck an SUV and showered the woman and children with debris. Keeto was hospitalized with a concussion.\n\n\"Mostly, my flashbacks are about the car accident,\" he said.\n\nShingleton said that her son became withdrawn after the crash and reluctant to speak. She wanted something different for him and enrolled him in the manhood program in January.\n\n\"The major thing that I am proud of about my son is that there are a lot of personal things in his life that he has overcome, and he's still facing challenges,\" Shingleton said. \"I think this program is an outlet for him to get out of that mind-set or environment of what he's still dealing with.\n\n\"I've seen him have a lot more confidence within himself and his involvement socially as well as academically. His academics have picked up a lot more in the program. It gave him balance.\"\n\nShingleton, who is pursuing a sociology degree, said the Afrocentric curriculum was one of the main selling points for her. But she's also impressed with the way her son has bonded with Akintunde.\n\n\"His father and I are separated, so having a male role model or a male figure at home is something that I don't have,\" she said. \"He's doing a nice job of occupying that space.\"\n\nErnest Jenkins Jr. is an eighth-grader who has spent a year in the program. He said the most important thing he has learned is African history.\n\n\"I didn't know that there was anything before slavery,\" he said. \"It's a good program. I'm glad I joined.\"\n\nHis father, Ernest Jenkins, appreciates the African history and the changes the program has brought in his son.\n\n\"He speaks up more,\" Jenkins said. \"He used to be quiet. He never said too much. Now I see him interacting with friends and hanging out. I think the program kind of helped him out a lot.\"\n\nOfficials from other communities around the country have visited Oakland and met with Chatmon and others trying to tackle the same problems. Michael Walker launched the Office of Black Male Student Achievement in Minneapolis Public Schools in 2014.\n\nWalker, 40, grew up on the north side of Minneapolis. He began the program by speaking at length with parents about what they wanted out of it. He said he recognized that some parents wouldn't come to meetings or stand up in public to discuss their thoughts.\n\nSo he walked neighborhoods, visited barbershops and hair salons and other places where he could catch parents and others as they went about their daily routines.\n\n\"I wanted to hear the uncut and raw experience,\" he said. \"I put myself into spaces that I felt would give me the chance to hear that.\"\n\nParents loved the idea of an Afrocentric curriculum as a counterweight to the negative stereotypes often applied to young black men.\n\n\"Slavery was part of our history, but a very small part of our history,\" Walker said. \"What we have done in our schools, we've made that the foundation of our history.\n\n\"A lot of it is information that (kids) didn't have the opportunity to learn in school. We address our young men as kings, so that they understand there's a richer history.\"\n\nThe Minneapolis program is still growing, but Walker said preliminary results show it's helping boost academic achievement and reduce disciplinary problems.\n\nChatmon said he's proud of the progress Oakland has made, and school district officials are happy with it, as well.\n\n\"The district believed in the work so much that with six years of African American Male Achievement, we have created the Office of Equity, which will be starting an African-American female achievement initiative,\" Chatmon said. \"We'll be beginning a Latino men and boys initiative, as well.\"\n\nChatmon said that the program has shown a need for a variety of approaches to educating students because of diverse backgrounds.\n\n\"The targeted strategy for African American Male Achievement has worked for six years, but now it gives way to begin to launch other targeted processes,\" Chatmon said. \"This program will give light to what those strategies are.\"\n\nContact John Wisely: 313-222-6825 or jwisely@freepress.com. On Twitter @jwisely.\n\nMore about the Office of African American Male Achievement\n\nThe office began with a budget of $200,000, but that has grown to $3.5 million annually, with the district providing half and the rest coming from private donors, foundations and others. It includes 18 teachers and 13 other staffers.\n\nIn addition to the Manhood Development Program, the office coordinates:\n\nTroubling test scores\n\nIn the Detroit Public Schools Community District, achievement is low across the board. But it's particularly troublesome for African-American male students, who score below the state average and worse than African-American girls.

      "text": "Why did some Black male voters in Milwaukee shift to Trump? These community leaders have ideas, perspective\n\nFewer Black Milwaukeeans voted for the Democratic Party in 2024 than in previous presidential elections. And, if national trends are an indication, President-elect Donald Trump gained support among Black men in Milwaukee, too.\n\nIn the wake of the November election, more numbers have detailed the shift:\n\nTo examine the shift, the Journal Sentinel asked several Black male community leaders in Milwaukee about their perspectives on how Black men voted in the election.\n\nRob \"Biko\" Baker is a Milwaukee native who has been part of the teaching faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee since 2018 in the African and African Diaspora Studies department. He said it's important to reiterate that all the polling shows strong support for the Democratic Party among Black people. That's more than any other demographic since Trump picked up a significantly larger amount of Latino male voters .\n\n\"We have to be a little cautious with exit polling and polling in general because everybody's sort of seen the downfall of the poll,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Baker said he's noticed a change in students of color in his classes, where open political discussion is encouraged.\n\nTory Lowe is a noted community figure who has advocated for Black families in the Milwaukee community for over a decade. He was part of a team from radio station 101.7 The Truth , where he's an afternoon host, that visited the White House for a Juneteenth celebration earlier this year.\n\n\"I had a chance to interview Trump, and I had a chance to endorse Trump, and I never did, because I'm an advocate,\" Lowe told the Journal Sentinel. \"I don't want to get involved in all of that; I'm not MAGA. I'm an independent but I voted for Trump and it's because I don't agree with nothing on the left.\n\n\"I can't fight a bogeyman that ain't in my community.\"\n\nLowe pointed to often-cited statistics that Black Milwaukeeans live under some of the worst conditions in the world. He said he reserved his political frustrations with Milwaukee's local politicians, who overwhelmingly are a part of or support the Democratic Party.\n\nHe believes the Democrats made too many mistakes during the COVID-19 pandemic, abandoned the working class, allow for undocumented immigrants to receive benefits ahead of low-income Black people, and are pushing an \"LGBT agenda\" on Black men and youth.\n\n\"Most people believe in man, woman and child,\" Lowe said.\n\nThe Rev. Greg Lewis is the executive director of Souls to the Polls Wisconsin . He supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the election and believes Black male votes are being siphoned off because the \"Democratic Party kind of took the community for granted\" and many voters \"do not pay attention\" and they wanted to be \"rebellious.\"\n\n\"People start to fall in love with folks who do them wrong,\" he said. \"I don't even understand it at all. ... The Stockholm Syndrome seems to be quite prevalent in Black and brown communities.\"\n\nFor most of Black America, there's a legacy - overcoming slavery, Jim Crow laws and a fight for civil rights, the rise of mass incarceration and education and health care disparities - that drives values today. While it's important not to view Black people as a monolith, there are certain values that are overwhelmingly supported in the Black community, public polling suggests.\n\nFor example, about 97% of Black Americans believe in God or a higher power . A vast majority say they've experienced racism in their life and that U.S. institutions were designed to hold Black people back , particularly the justice system and policing. A majority are cynical of the health care system, having experienced disparities . A strong majority support an option to let their child attend a school outside of the local nearby public school.\n\nSome of these values, along with thriving personal finances, could see political movement in Trump's second term.\n\n\"Black people, many of us, are naturally conservative,\" Baker said. \"But overall, people have always voted with their pocketbooks.\"\n\nBlack voters cited the economy and jobs as the most important issues the country faced in polling before the election. And there's a growing difference of opinion among Black men on who's best equipped to handle male voters' single biggest issue - their wallet.\n\n\"There's misogyny and sexism; that's a real thing,\" Baker said. \"A lot of men struggle with women as leaders, which is a little bit difficult to sort of wrap our heads around. ... But people are also tired of hearing fake promises, and so rather than doubling down on (Democrats), they wanted to give Trump a chance.\"\n\nImmigration policy and its effect on the economy was also an issue discussed in his UWM class.\n\n\"Many Black men particularly fear that immigrants have come for their working-class jobs,\" he said.\n\nTrump, who takes office Jan. 20, has vowed to mass-deport immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, saying he'll use the military to complete the task and prevent immigrants from stealing \"Black jobs.\"\n\nAt the same time, the ACLU has vowed to fight the Trump administration through litigation, and there are economists who say mass deportations would hurt the economy, especially Wisconsin's farming industry.\n\nAn estimated 11.7 million immigrants live in the U.S. illegally, according to the Pew Research Center - and there's been a sharp rise in undocumented immigrants in recent years.\n\nThe claim that immigrants are taking jobs from native-born Americans is repeated by Trump and his advisers but has been disputed by economists who say people in the U.S. illegally most often take on jobs that native workers are unwilling to fill, such as in agriculture and food processing.\n\nThere's also a mistaken belief that the immigration population is only of Latino heritage.\n\n\"We have immigrants from the (Caribbean) islands, from Africa,\" Lewis said. \"Immigration has been a problem for Black folks for years. ... Black people have been eliminated from migrating to America for a long time, ever since the days of slavery.\n\n\"The thought process of folks who vote for a party or a guy who's going to eliminate their possibility for becoming citizens is certainly, I mean, ... that just demolishes any part of rationality that I can see in communities of color. ... When he tells you who he is, you ought to believe him.\"\n\nIn addition to immigration policy, the reality of rare government checks during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted young people. The federal government sent $1,200 per income-tax filer and $500 per child to each American in March 2020 while Trump was president and sent a second round of $600 in December 2020. A third round of $1,400 came in March 2021 during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe stimulus checks and the idea that Trump made them possible, even noting that Trump would sign the checks himself , resonated with some young Black voters.\n\n\"I've heard people talk about ... stimulus checks,\" Baker said. \"I think that was a real thing.\"\n\nWhile Biden prioritized reducing the coronavirus' effects on the public - important since the Black community took the brunt of COVID's blow - he didn't make the investments into local communities that fostered real change to a young Black person's bottom line, Baker said.\n\nSome civic engagement groups supporting Black lives that received millions during social justice movements across the U.S. within the last decade have seen many of their resources dry up, according to Baker.\n\nHe said he's spoken to a leader of a local nonprofit that has seen its budget fall from $2.5 million to $250,000 since Biden took office. Usually these organizations rely in part on federal funding, like grants. He said if Democrats feel they've made the investments, they need to do a better job of articulating that.\n\nAt the same time, young Black people want to create and support Black-owned businesses, and a conservative philosophy of less regulation could benefit those same people, Baker said.\n\nLewis, though, disagrees that the Democratic Party hasn't put in the work and made investments in the Black community.\n\n\"As a community, we're not sophisticated enough to understand the economy,\" he said. \"But, Biden has been good to Black folks, especially with pocketbooks, and especially with providing resources in the community and job opportunities.\"\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed into law a criminal justice reform bill addressing federal prisons. Now, there's optimism for more action under a new Trump administration.\n\nTrump, having been convicted of felonies by a New York jury, views himself as a victim of the justice system.\n\n\"I was on a call with some people, and they kept calling Trump a convicted felon,\" Baker said. \"And I was like, yeah, you gotta stop doing that. Like, we live in a city where, like, 50% of all Black men have had some type of engagement with the police.\n\n\"When you start talking like this, you sound like you're not for the reform that you said you were advocating for.\"\n\nWisconsin's arrest records and prison populations reveal deep racial and socioeconomic disparities, disadvantaging many young people of color. In 2021, one in every 36 Black adults in Wisconsin was in prison - a rate that was the highest in the nation and more than twice as high as the national average. Legal troubles can make it more difficult for young Black men to have upward mobility in their communities.\n\nThe majority of Black Americans support their local police department , but mistrust in authorities remains due to centuries of systemic racism.\n\n\"I think if Trump is going to be the one that says, 'Hey, we're going to finally figure this out,' I'm with it. And I think that all Black people should be with it,\" Baker said.\n\nHowever, there are concerns with the use of privatized prisons that some in the Republican Party have encouraged.\n\n\"Locking up people is big business,\" Lewis said. \"Why would people desert an opportunity to make huge profits ... and what better than Americans locking up Black and brown populations to secure the incomes of the rich? I don't see that changing in America, since the '70s.\"\n\nBaker looks at America's education system and sees a need for reform because he says schools remain filled with partisan politics.\n\nPolling commissioned by The American Federation for Children, a supporter of \"school choice,\" suggests that a majority of Black Americans support an option for their child to attend a school outside their ZIP code, which aligns with many in the Republican Party. But that same poll also suggests that many of those same voters trust the Democratic Party more on education.\n\nThere are concerns about affordability and transportation to schools, which some Republicans have proposed vouchers for. For many Black residents, the nearby public school is the only option.\n\nTrump hasn't vowed major legislation overhauling the education system but instead advocates for an end to the U.S. Department of Education, which would require congressional approval. Abolishing the department would end federal protections against discrimination in schools based on race, among other concerns.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan said the same thing ... and it's just too hard to do,\" Baker said.\n\nIn any case, education decisions are typically local decisions, Baker said, and it's not the Republican Party in charge when you see issues at districts like Milwaukee Public Schools.\n\n\"A lot of the times, it's liberals who have ... I don't want to speak too negatively ... but have not met the cultural needs of the Black community,\" Baker said.\n\n\"And so, people can see with their own eyes, and they can judge with their own eyes. A lot of people try to act like Black people have been tricked or duped, but, no, we can see that the institutions aren't serving us, and so people are looking for hope.\"\n\nAt the same time, Baker opposes efforts by some Republican officials to ban books in schools, and change curriculum that addresses racial identity and Black history.\n\n\"I think that is dangerous,\" he said. \"And I would hope that the Republicans would have enough sense to not try to water down the history, but give us the true history, instead of giving us the fake news history. Get the real history.\"\n\nTo help stem frustration, Baker said many of his students have become less loyal to one political party in recent years and he thinks it's an encouraging sign.\n\n\"Black people have to get out of the space where we're only rocking with one party or one candidate,\" he said. \"We have to have multiple interests, and we have to work with any of those leaders that are willing to serve our interests.\"\n\nFor Baker, Lewis and Lowe, the oppression of Black people is bipartisan.\n\n\"Biden really did a lot of trying to mend that issue. He really did,\" Lewis said. \"But people aren't paying attention to that and that's why you get what you got.\"\n\nLewis still can't seem to come to terms with Trump's sweeping victory.\n\n\"I still don't think this guy won,\" he said. \"He's a racist, a bigot. He don't care about about anybody but himself and people still went out and voted for him. ... Common sense is just not common sense anymore in America.\"\n\nBaker sees the result as an indictment of leaders in the Democratic Party for taking authoritative actions in the past, particularly during civil unrest.\n\n\"I was arrested during the Ferguson rebellion under the Obama administration,\" Baker said. \"I saw how a Democratic governor in Missouri was treating people real bad.\"\n\nBaker spent a year in Ferguson, Missouri, after the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old Black man shot and killed by a police officer , sparking civil unrest. He helped protest and organize a movement but was also chronicling the demonstrations and writing about Ferguson for media like Vanity Fair.\n\nNow, he says the re-election of Trump is an opportunity.\n\nBaker said Trump might not be the solution, but could be a catalyst, that starts bipartisanship and real change. He looks at other parts of the country that have shown a willingness to change parties or vote for both parties. He points to the Latino community and parts of New York City, like some voters in Queens and the Bronx who voted for both Trump and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a progressive Democrat.\n\n\"That creates a unique perspective where you have leverage in places where you might not have had,\" Baker said. \"We have to rally behind candidates that are real, that don't play lip service, don't go back and forth on their issues, but are really connected to our interests.\n\n\"And I think what you're seeing is that young people especially are much more sophisticated, even if the sophistication sees them not participating. They don't want to be pandered to. We need candidates that can be service leaders, can be steward leaders and we need to get behind them.\"\n\nBaker said there are many high-quality local leaders in Milwaukee, and he was encouraged that turnout was up in Wisconsin, but the election result needs to be a wakeup call.\n\nNow that the vast majority of Black Milwaukee remained loyal to their elected leaders and the Democratic Party, he said it's apparent which voting bloc has the most leverage.\n\n\"We've got some great leaders in Milwaukee. ... People do trust their local leaders,\" he said. \"But, I think it's time to define our interests and keep pushing for them.\"\n\nDrake Bentley can be reached at DBentley1@gannett.com ."

      "text": "Focus group: Black men who backed Trump approve of his presidency - but raise some concerns about DOGE\n\nManage your account\n\nNew conversations with Black men who voted for Donald Trump in swing states in November showed that nearly all of them remain staunchly with him, but his administration's Department of Government Efficiency and his tariffs are potential pain points for the president among his supporters.\n\nSome of these men - who participated in a recent focus group observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 Deciders series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago - raised concerns about the speed of the DOGE cuts and billionaire Elon Musk's power, while others backed the department's attempt to address a bloated government.\n\nOverall, they remain largely supportive of Trump because they believe he's taken the decisive action he promised on the campaign trail, and 10 of the 12 focus group participants stand by their vote in November, with the remaining two saying they wouldn't vote for Trump again if given a do-over.\n\nThese Trump-voting Black men, including some who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, also expressed deep frustration with a rudderless Democratic Party, and were divided on the future of diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nThis group included six independents, four Democrats and two Republicans. Five of these voters - the four Democrats and one independent - said they voted for Biden in 2020 before backing Trump in 2024. Unlike a poll, which uses statistical methods to demonstrate how a larger population feels, the focus groups dig deeper into how individual panelists view key questions facing the country.\n\nWhile 10 of the 12 participants said they approved of Trump's early tenure during his second presidency, the results were far more mixed when it came to Musk and DOGE. Five said they approved of DOGE's actions, three said they disapproved and the rest weren't sure yet.\n\nAmong those backing DOGE, the spending audits and cuts were seen as bringing a bit of the private sector to government work, aimed at increasing efficiency of employees paid by taxpayer money.\n\n\"Every company needs someone to audit them. You shouldn't be an untouchable, you shouldn't be a sacred cow,\" said Dorris S., a 56-year-old independent from Pennsylvania. \"They're there to maximize productivity and efficiency. I used to manage restaurants, we had health inspectors.\"\n\nAnd Illya M., a 37-year-old from Arizona, said that it's time to turn the tables on the federal government.\n\n\"They're forcing us to file our taxes, so we're technically doing an audit, so I think everybody should be audited,\" he said.\n\nSeven of the 12 participants specifically mentioned the possibility of the Trump administration sending Americans $5,000 checks, with five saying the checks would be funded by DOGE cuts. While Trump and his allies have promoted the idea of sending these \"DOGE dividends,\" no decision has been made about whether to do so.\n\nThe positive sentiment about DOGE was far from universal, and even those who said they supported its efforts weren't necessarily sold on its implementation.\n\nIllya M. went on to add that he \"heard they got the numbers wrong at some point,\" adding, \"I don't see how this is really going to benefit us on a personal basis.\"\n\nAmong those who disapprove of DOGE's efforts, there were concerns both about Musk's accumulating power and the potential for \"unintended consequences.\"\n\n\"The volume of the cuts - are there going to be unintended consequences that we didn't see until later down the road?\" asked Denzel B., a 37-year-old Democrat from Arizona.\n\nJeffrey G., a 57-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Biden in 2020 before backing Trump this time, lamented how Trump \"should have gone in with a scalpel instead of a blowtorch.\"\n\n\"Sure, you want to weed out the bad people that probably are bad people, but you want to keep good employees that are there,\" he said.\n\nThomas A., a 49-year-old Democrat from Georgia who voted for Biden in 2020 and switched to Trump in 2024, said that while DOGE is doing \"some good,\" he's concerned about the power Trump has delegated to Musk. He also wondered if DOGE's work could be antithetical to a push to improve the economy and help everyday Americans.\n\n\"He's too focused on cutting the weeds and the clutter, but he needs to focus on the economy and how to help people,\" he said of Trump.\n\n\"Being enthusiastic about DOGE tracks closely with passion for Trump, but passion for Trump doesn't always translate into enthusiasm for DOGE,\" said Rich Thau, president of Engagious , who moderated the sessions.\n\nOnly three out of 12 participants affirmatively said Trump is making battling inflation a top priority, with those who said so largely connecting it to his threats to enact sweeping tariffs or cut government spending.\n\nBut that focus wasn't a positive for Jeffrey G., who disapproves of Trump and wouldn't vote for him again if he could do the 2024 election over, because he doesn't agree with the president's economic moves.\n\n\"His way of fighting inflation, it's going to be a painful process,\" he said, \"by making other countries pay their share of tariffs.\"\n\nMost of the participants, who didn't believe Trump has made fighting inflation a top priority, said they didn't necessarily mind.\n\n\"He has his hands in so many different things - I can wait 'til he gets to the six-month point, then I'll start worrying,\" said Garland S., a 47-year-old Republican from Michigan.\n\nThe sentiment meshes with how most of these men view Trump after two months in office, with broad approval of his job performance because they say he's being \"aggressive\" in his follow-through after the campaign.\n\n\"I expected him to be aggressive in a lot of different areas and he's doing exactly that,\" said Dorris S. \"Every few days, you're hearing something different and you're constantly seeing him at work, working, getting stuff done. So that's why I approve.\"\n\nTariffs are dividing this group, however. They're particularly concerning to those who aren't fully on board with Trump, such as Denzel B. and Jeffrey G., who both disapprove of Trump after voting for him and both raised concerns about tariffs.\n\nBut those still on board with Trump largely see the tariffs as the president's way to bludgeon the world economy into submission and, eventually, tackle rising prices at home.\n\n\"I did this past four years with this,\" Kasheem S., a 38-year-old independent from Pennsylvania, said of inflation. \"If it has to continue on a little bit 'til it balances itself out, then I don't have a problem with that. It's already been going on.\"\n\nIllya M. said that he is giving Trump a wide berth to deliver on his promises for a similar reason: He sees Trump as someone who's willing to at least try to make change.\n\n\"He did a lot of things - whether it actually happens exactly how he wanted it to happen or not, at least he tried and actually did something. So, that's more than I could say about the Democrats, probably ever,\" he said.\n\nOther participants shared that sentiment. \"Liars,\" \"untrustworthy,\" \"ungodly,\" \"a weird agenda\" and \"weak\" were just a few of the words they used to describe the Democratic Party today.\n\nDemocrats make \"a bunch of false promises,\" said Kasheem S. He added that he views the Democratic agenda as an attack on children, saying Democrats are \"not really relatable, just trying to sell a dream that's not the reality.\"\n\n\"I think it's chaos,\" said Antonio W., 47, of Arizona. \"Holding onto the past. They got nothing, to me, to promote to the American public.\"\n\nThe self-described Democrats also had some choice words for their party after splitting with it to vote for Trump last year.\n\n\"They're weak and hypocritical,\" said Marlon M., a 47-year-old Democrat from Pennsylvania, who advised his party to \"stop pointing the finger\" and follow through on its promises.\n\n\"Right now, they have a lack of leadership,\" said Jeffrey G. \"There's not one lone voice right now for the Democratic Party.\"\n\nSome felt that Democrats were not looking out for Black Americans or men. In one panel, all five participants said men do not get a fair shake when Democrats are in charge.\n\nAnd some criticized Democrats for leaning on leaders like former President Barack Obama or celebrities like Cardi B to win their votes.\n\n\"They got Obama up here to talk to us men as if he's in control or something,\" said Kasheem S., later adding, \"Stop with all the celebrities. ... A lot was spent on celebrities with that campaign and it did nothing for me.\"\n\nCritical of their own party, the Democratic Trump voters in the group did seem open to supporting Republican candidates other than Trump moving forward.\n\n\"I think voting for Trump now has opened my eyes to more consideration on a Republican side, just naturally,\" said Denzel B., who said Republicans could win him over by continuing to build on Trump's agenda.\n\nThomas A. said Republicans could win his vote if they prioritize their economic policies and lay out \"how it's going to affect me and my family.\"\n\nMargaret Talev - director of Syracuse University's Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship, which leads the focus group project in partnership with Engagious/Sago - told NBC News that the group showed that \"whether their embrace now of President Trump or Elon Musk is strong or conditional, they are united in their mistrust of and disappointment with Democrats as the alternative\" and represent the \"deep disillusionment of some male voters of color with the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAs Trump has made dismantling federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs an early focus of his administration, the participants were divided along party lines over whether such programs should continue, reflecting the broad partisan polarization over DEI programs in a recent NBC News poll.\n\nThe four Democrats in the focus groups - Denzel B., Marlon M., Thomas A. and Jeffrey G. - were the only participants to say that DEI programs should continue.\n\n\"It may not be perfect, but I think it still has to be something in place to combat discrepancies in the workplace,\" said Jeffrey G, who lamented that DEI has been used to question the qualifications of people of color.\n\nThe rest of the participants said DEI programs should be eliminated.\n\n\"Affirmative action never helped me, so I'm cool with not having affirmative action, DEI or any of that,\" said Illya M. \"May the best person get the job.\"\n\nTwo participants also used the same analogy to underscore their opposition to DEI programs.\n\n\"If I'm in the hospital, I'm having surgery, I don't care if the doctor's Black, white, Indian,\" said Garland S. \"I want the best doctor.\"\n\nThe participants also weighed in on Trump suggesting, without offering any evidence or support for that position, that DEI policies were to blame for the deadly midair collision between a plane and an Army helicopter in January.\n\nThe same participants who supported DEI programs found Trump's comments objectionable, noting the president made those comments without evidence. The other members of the focus groups did not take issue with Trump's suggestion, and one participant sided with the president.\n\n\"I wouldn't even be comfortable knowing that they was a DEI hire - I don't wanna be on this plane,\" said Illya M. \"So hey, I'm with him 100%.\"\n\nThe participants were also asked about an effort from some Trump allies, including conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, to encourage the president to pardon former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of killing George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020. Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests against racism and a national reckoning over race and policing. Chauvin was sentenced on federal and state charges relating to Floyd's death, and Trump could only offer a pardon relating to the federal charges. (Trump, for his part, told reporters earlier this month that he had not heard about the push to pardon Chauvin.)\n\nSeveral participants said they would be upset if Trump pardoned Chauvin, with Charles B., a 51-year-old Republican from Wake Forest, North Carolina, saying, \"That's a nation that would be pissed.\"\n\nBut a few appeared open to giving Trump the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"OK, I'm upset,\" said Joel A., 65, from Pennsylvania. \"But he might know something that I don't know.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

      "text": "The reality of Black men's love lives and marriages is very different than what's usually shown on TV - I spent years actually talking to them\n\nManage your account\n\nFinding and keeping a good Black man in a relationship has become a cottage industry . From celebrities and reality TV stars to social media influencers , for better or worse, there is no shortage of relationship advice to people seeking to figure out Black men .\n\nAnd while much of this content is understood to be for entertainment purposes only, some of it is presented and received as legitimate and data-driven.\n\nThis is a problem because too many people cannot distinguish what they see onscreen from reality. Media portrayals are often hyperbolic and sensationalized to attract public attention. Equally troubling is that the majority of academic research in this area also perpetuates many of the same, negative patterns that are common in popular culture.\n\nAs a graduate student and university professor , I have spent nearly two decades reviewing these studies on Black men and families. The general consensus from them falls into one of two categories: first, that many Black men are not viable marriage mates because their financial struggles will not allow them to provide for a wife and children .\n\nOther studies conclude that many poor Black men reject monogamous romantic relationships in favor of a hypersexual masculinity to overcompensate for their inability to fulfill the traditional breadwinner role. These men, the studies conclude, treat women as conquests rather than partners .\n\nIn both historical and more recent research, studies on Black men have disproportionately examined the lives of low-income men and the struggles they faced in maintaining stable relationships in the face of economic disadvantage .\n\nI have found that the near-exclusive focus on low-income Black men in research related to the family skews perceptions of these men. It also limits the public's knowledge of them and the meanings they attach to their romantic relationships. And this perception can be used to perpetuate negative stereotypes that frame them as dangerous and predatory.\n\nIn response to that limited view, I spent the last four years conducting a study on a more diverse group of Black men to learn more about their perspectives on marriage.\n\nThe men's stories reveal important findings that are typically not explored in research on Black men. They opened up about their desire for intimacy and companionship in their relationships.\n\nMy findings, many of which are counter to the popular image that our society holds of Black men, have just been published in a book, \" Black Love Matters: Authentic Men's Voices on Marriage and Romantic Relationships .\"\n\nMy study followed 33 Black men from Louisville, Kentucky, chronicling their personal circumstances, as well as their attitudes, experiences and behaviors within their marriages and romantic relationships. The data for the study were collected from over 150 hours of interviews with the men.\n\nThe men I interviewed ranged in age from 18 to 72. They represented a variety of relationship statuses, with men reporting being single, romantically involved, married, divorced and remarried. The men were also diverse in their educational attainment. Some had graduate and professional degrees, while others had high school diplomas and GEDs. The men also varied in their economic situations, with annual incomes ranging from $0 to US$175,000.\n\nIn sharing their experiences, the men provided an in-depth look into their love lives. Their discussions touched on many important factors that have shaped their past and current relationships.\n\nThey reflected on how they met their partners and the characteristics that made them stand out from previous partners. The men described their ideal marriage mate and shared what marriage means to them.\n\nIn discussing what attracted him to his wife, one man stated, \"She wasn't phony. She was comfortable being herself, she wasn't trying to impress anybody. So it made me learn to be comfortable being myself.\"\n\nIn the interviews, many of the men credit their partners with making them better husbands, fathers and men. According to one of the participants, \"I always tell her that I couldn't have become who I am without her. Meeting the right person, to stand with the right person is probably the most important decision I've made in my life.\"\n\nThe men even recognize the ways their relationships serve to combat the negative perception that often surrounds Black men.\n\n\"The media portrays us as shiftless and violent and not to be trusted. I think when you see a man with a woman treating her well, a man with his children treating them the way they should be treated, it dispels a lot of what folks see in the media. Just seeing positive men doing what men should do is a good thing,\" said one man.\n\nMost often, the men talked about how the unique characteristics that set their mate apart from others they had dated.\n\nIn explaining what attracted him to his wife, one man stated, \"I think just how she was able to articulate to me who she was and how she shared some of my values when it comes to children and relationships. It's just how she carries herself. Her presence made me want to be with her and I never had another woman make me feel like that.\"\n\nHowever, many of these men said they struggle with previous traumas that challenge their relationships. A detective alluded to the psychological stress he faced in being a Black man having to police his community at a time of distrust and unrest, only to come home and have to be emotionally available for his wife.\n\nIn one of his interviews, he stated, \"I try not to let the stress bother me, but it's still one of those things. It just does. Sometimes I'm really withdrawn because I'm thinking about things at work or I'm always working. When it happens, I've got to put myself in check.\"\n\nAnother man wrestled with the realization that many of his former girlfriends had a striking resemblance to a babysitter who abused him as a child.\n\nIn discussing their fears and insecurities, many of the men acknowledge being guarded with their emotions as a result of some of their early experiences.\n\nEven when they were able to move beyond early negative experiences, many of the men discussed feeling haunted by their friends and family members' failed relationships.\n\nIn these cases, the men expressed concern that their relationships would not last. As one participant said, \"I don't know that many people of color have seen marriage modeled very well.\"\n\nYet over and over again, in the interviews, men told how they would strive to maintain their relationships in the face of myriad internal and external challenges including racism and early negative relationship experiences.\n\nGiven the lack of research on Black men featuring firsthand accounts from them, \"Black Love Matters\" represents a departure from previous work that seems to be preoccupied with implicating Black men in discussions of what ails their families and communities.\n\nIn lifting up the men's voices, \"Black Love Matters\" shifts the focus away from talking about Black men and instead talks to them about how they love and want to be loved.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation , a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

      "text": "Opinion: Trump received 21% of Black men's votes. Democrats ignored the warning signs\n\nManage your account\n\nUpdated to correct a technical issue in the content management system.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris didn't just lose the 2024 presidential election. She was crushed. Smacked. Cooked, as the kids say.\n\nThe initial response coming from Democratic camps was expected: America's still not ready for a woman president. America definitely isn't ready for a woman president who's also not white.\n\nThose things may be true, but the larger point is that this particular woman, running this particular campaign, wasn't the best combination with which to test that theory.\n\nEven if Dems concede that Biden played a role in not stepping aside sooner, and they acknowledge that a lack of a primary vote may have put forth a candidate who wasn't widely supported across the base, the fact remains that Harris failed to maximize her potential in reaching and energizing key voting blocs.\n\nNotably, exit polls show that while only 7% of Black women voted for President-elect Donald Trump, the former President secured 21% of the Black male vote .\n\nDuring the Democratic National Convention in August, I wrote about the party's clear attempt to capture new voters , which I believed came at the expense of groups that have exhibited historical support. I mentioned Black men, specifically, because I was already hearing grumbling from this group that had long felt like a political afterthought.\n\nI wrote about Black male employment and the truth that rippled through Trump's \"Black jobs\" comment - the truth that Black men tend to stick to the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, disproportionately affected by unemployment but also low-wage positions. Black men are also legitimately less employable, given lower college enrollment and graduation rates.\n\nBut instead of building strategy with this knowledge - instead of understanding that a large segment of the electorate is also without a college degree, and either shifting or creating policy to address it - Dems ignored it.\n\nThey assumed that Black men would continue to vote in a left-leaning bloc. And they assumed that anyone who dared to deviate from the plan was simply sexist and needed to be educated into submission. That \"education\" wasn't rooted in Harris's platform; it was, instead, resting on a weak projection of some moral or racial obligation that Democratic leadership felt should supersede individual needs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Paola Ramos , author of the book \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What it Means for America,\" spoke on NBCNews about the shift of many Latinos from the Democratic to the Republican Party, noting that a full understanding of these communities and how they vote will only come with more curiosity and less assumption.\n\n\"Who we are now is vastly different from who we are 20 years ago,\" she explained. \"We are more Americanized, right? It is third generation Latinos that are the fastest growing segment within our community, so what does that mean? That means that the majority of us are US.-born, and so we may feel more American at this point, than sort of connected to those immigrant roots. And that's where the discrepancy lies.\"\n\nThe result: A group of voters who are willing to vote for Trump despite a promise of mass deportations and a campaign rally speaker who likened Puerto Rico - and, subsequently, Puerto Ricans - to garbage . Compared to 2020, Trump improved his performance with Latinos, securing 38% of the Latino women vote and a staggering 55% of Latino men .\n\nTrump's win with Latinos also means that Harris, and the Democrat Party at large, lost. But what I did not hear from Ramos, nor any other political expert, Latino or otherwise, is what Latino voters should do, or how they failed Democrats.\n\nBut this, of course, is the exact language that is routinely used toward Black men, many of whom have expressed frustration about the left, more generally, and Harris, specifically. I saw it at a local organizing event a couple weeks ago, wherein Black men were asked to comment on Harris's recently announced Opportunity Agenda for Black Men .\n\nThe Agenda was a last-ditch push to recapture a slipping vote, one that felt rushed and less than intentional, and that came in lockstep with former President Barack Obama's command that Black men get over themselves and vote for the Black woman on the ballot . It made sense, then, that the Black men at that local event were chastised for not expressing full-throated support of Harris and her plan.\n\nFor generations, people will look back on this election and ask themselves how a convicted felon who was found liable of sexual assault and is known for making incendiary, often racist, statements could have secured the election and the popular vote.\n\nTo find the answer, they must also ask how so many people who come from communities that have long been aligned with the Democratic Party could so convincingly change their mind.\n\nBecause one thing is certain: Democrats' notions of how certain Americans should think and vote are secondary to reality.\n\nAnd as long as Dems continue to focus on what should be instead of what is , they will continue to bleed support - whether those voters continue to shift to the right or opt out of the political process altogether.\n\nAndrea Williams is an opinion columnist for The Tennessean and curator of the Black Tennessee Voices initiative.

      "text": "Obama's callout to Black men touches a nerve among Democrats. Is election-year misogyny at play?\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Barack Obama had frank words for Black men who may be considering sitting out the election.\n\n\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" he said Thursday to Harris-Walz campaign volunteers and officials at a field office in Pittsburgh.\n\nAmerica's first Black president touched a nerve among Democrats worried about Vice President Kamala Harris' chances of becoming the second.\n\nHarris is counting on Black turnout in battleground states such as Pennsylvania in her tight race with Republican Donald Trump, who has focused on energizing men of all races and tried to make inroads with Black men in particular.\n\nObama's comments belie that Black men still overwhelmingly back Harris. But her campaign and allies have worked hard trying to shore up support with this critical group of voters - and addressing questions about potential misogyny.\n\nBlack Americans are the most Democratic-leaning racial demographic in the country, with Black men being outpaced only by Black women in their support for Democrats.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on several major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThere was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nBut Khalil Thompson, co-founder and executive director of Win With Black Men, said he agreed with what he saw as Obama's larger point.\n\n\"I believe President Obama is speaking to a tangible, visceral understanding of what it means for all men to relate to women in America. Calling out misogyny is not wrong,\" said Thompson, whose group raised more than $1.3 million for Harris from 20,000 Black men in the 24 hours after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race in July and made way for Harris.\n\nWin With Black Men has organized weekly calls and events meant to bolster Harris' standing with Black men. The flurry of activism has focused on combating misinformation in Black communities about Harris, as well as an emphasis on the policy priorities of Black men, which the group found are often centered on greater economic opportunities, safe communities, social justice policies and health care, particularly for the partners and children of Black men.\n\n\"We're not a monolith,\" Thompson said. \"However, we are just like every other American in this country who wants a good paying job, that we can provide for our children and participate in their lives and the lives of our partner, that we can get them home safely, afford to go to the grocery store, save a little for retirement and have a vacation.\"\n\nHarris said she believes the votes of Black men must be earned , like with any group of voters.\n\nBlack men \"are not in our back pocket,\" she told a panel hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in September.\n\nHarris recently sat down with the \"All The Smoke\" podcast hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson to discuss her racial identity and policy issues of interest to Black men. On Tuesday, Harris will appear in Detroit for a live conversation with Charlamagne tha God, a prominent Black media personality.\n\nThe Harris campaign is conducting a number of outreach efforts to Black voters, including an tour of homecomings at historically Black colleges and universities, a number of radio and TV ads targeting Black voters in key states, and a get-out-the-vote operation engaging Black communities that complements the work of allied groups such as Win With Black Men.\n\nIt has also tapped high-profile surrogates, including politicians, business leaders, professional athletes and musical artists, to court Black men.\n\n\"Our Black men, we've got to get them out to vote,\" said former NBA star Magic Johnson during a recent Harris rally in Flint, Michigan. \"Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things to the Black community that he did not deliver on. And we've got to make sure we help Black men understand that.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies have held roundtables for Black men and conducted a bus tour through swing states that featured cookouts in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia. The campaign believes the former president's appeals on issues such as the economy, immigration and traditional gender roles resonate with some Black men.\n\nTrump has also sought to exploit Obama's remarks, writing on social media Friday that Obama \"admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men.\" On Saturday, the campaign's Black Men for Trump advisory board released a statement condemning Obama's remarks as \"insulting.\"\n\n\"It's demeaning to suggest that we can't evaluate a candidate's track record - especially when Kamala Harris has done more harm than good to Black communities,\" wrote the group in a letter that was co-signed by Reps. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., Wesley Hunt, R-Tex., as well as former state lawmakers and longtime Trump allies, including former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, whose prison sentence for corruption crimes was commuted by Trump during his administration's final hours.\n\nTrump earlier this year mused that the criminal charges against him in four separate indictments, one of which led to a conviction with another dismissed, made him more relatable to Black people.\n\n\"A lot of people said that's why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against,\" he told a Black conservative audience in South Carolina.\n\nTrump's support among Black, white, and Hispanic male voters worries senior Harris campaign officials as the election increasingly shapes up as divided along gender lines, with Harris stronger with women and Trump stronger with men.\n\nBut the debate over to what degree misogyny plays a role in some Black men not supporting Harris sidesteps a broader conversation on how Black men are engaged as full citizens in politics, argues Philip Agnew, founder of the grassroots political organization Black Men Build.\n\n\"To be a Black man in the United States is to be invisible and hypervisible at the same time, and neither one of those is a humanizing viewpoint,\" Agnew said.\n\nAgnew's group traveled to 10 cities across the summer, hosting roundtables with Black men and making the case for civic engagement and a progressive politics. Agnew said many Black men throughout those conversations expressed exasperation toward politics, a sentiment shared by many Americans, in addition to a feeling that their political perspectives were often misunderstood or unappreciated.\n\n\"The Black men I know are incredibly concerned with the lives of our families and our communities,\" Agnew said. \"It's because of an abundance of love for our sisters that we ask questions, not a lack of love.\""

      "text": "Harris announces a new plan to empower Black men as she tries to energize them to vote for her\n\nManage your account\n\nERIE, Pa. (AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan on Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as she works to energize a key voting bloc that has Democrats concerned about a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nHarris' plan includes providing forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men.\n\nHarris already has said she supports legalizing marijuana and her plan calls for working to ensure that Black men have opportunities to participate as a \"national cannabis industry takes shape.\" She also is calling for better regulating cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nThe vice president's \"opportunity agenda for Black men\" is meant to invigorate African American males at a moment when there are fears some may sit out the election rather than vote for Harris or her opponent, Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe vice president unveiled the plan as she visited Erie, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, for a conversation with Black men from the area.\n\nThe business, opened just five weeks ago, is the project of Ishmael and Allana Trainor, a married couple of Erie natives who returned to their hometown after living for years in Arizona.\n\nLater, Harris held a campaign rally in the northwest Pennsylvania city, where she pilloried Trump for suggesting in a weekend Fox News interview that the U.S. military may need to be deployed to quell an \"enemy from within\" if Election Day is disturbed by agitators.\n\nHer push comes after former President Barack Obama suggested last week that some Black men \"aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign also has been working to increase support among other male voting blocs , including Hispanics, by founding the group \"Hombres con Harris,\" Spanish for \"Men with Harris.\" The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating Black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day .\n\nAs her campaign has done with the \"Hombres\" group, Harris' team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include \"Black Men Huddle Up\" events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond , co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy \"where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of Black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over Black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with Black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans .\n\nHarris' new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks \"with a proven commitment to their communities,\" her campaign says.\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that Black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation's public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey .\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more Black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities.\n\nThe vice president's advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with Black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect Black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas. There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women."

There were pockets of America where Trump's pull was strong, with certain states like North Carolina pulling in a greater share of Black men's votes.\n\nDespite much hand-wringing about whether Black men would jump ship from the Democratic Party and vote in droves for Donald Trump , election exit polls tell a different story.\n\nEarly exit polls from The Washington Post show that 78% of Black men voted for Kamala Harris . The vice president's numbers were just one point under those who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\n\"We said early on, based on our data, that the mainstream media was going to continue to prepare to blame Black men for whatever the results of this election were going to be,\" said Dr. David Johns, Executive Director and CEO of the National Black Justice Coalition in an interview with theGrio. \"What our data showed, in fact, that the biggest divide was not gender. It was generational concerns for older voters and adults are different than younger generation millennials, Gen Z and the like.\"\n\nJohns says that many Black men carried empathy for the plight of women in the post-Roe era and had the women they loved in mind when they went to the polls.\n\n\"I just apologized to my 21-year-old Black niece who lives in Texas where both of our parents were born,\" Johns told theGrio. \"She didn't ask to be born. She is just now able to engage in a political process that has continued to state and constrain her life options and opportunities, often without her being able to consent.\"\n\nNevertheless, Trump still made notable gains with Black men, earning an estimated 20 percent of Black male voters per Politico . In specific states like North Carolina, Black male voters did break for Trump, with 1 in 5 Black men voting for him, which was twice his support in 2020, according to CBS exit polls .\n\nAccording to Washington Post exit polls, Black women overwhelmingly voted for Harris, with 92% voting for her - even higher than the number of Black women who voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nAny gender gap in the Black community is indicative of a much larger gender nationally. Acc ording to CNN exit polls, women voters leaned toward Harris by 10 points, but not at the levels they did for Joe Biden in 2020 or Hillary Clinton in 2016. Meanwhile, Trump gained in his standing with male voters overall.\n\nLatinos, who are categorized as a race in most exit polls, despite being a community composed of multiple races of people (ex., white Latinos, Black Latinos, mixed Latinos, etc.), also voted for Trump in larger numbers than previously seen. While 45% of Latinos voted for Trump, per The Washington Post, a whopping 54% of Latino men broke for Trump.\n\nHowever, white men and women determined the greatest impact of a demographic group's choice in the 2024 election.\n\nAccording to Washington Post exit polls, the majority of white voters - 55% - voted for Donald Trump. When broken down by gender, 59% of white men voted for Trump, and 52% of white women followed. There was no massive departure of white female voters from white male voters.\n\n\"All I'm gonna say is some of y'all spent a lot of time questioning/doubting Black men and not enough on white women and Latino voters.

      "text": "Kamala Harris' plan for Black men hailed as 'game changer'\n\nManage your account\n\n\"It is the most direct Black men policy I can recall of a presidential candidate,\" said Michael Blake, a former Obama alum and CEO of KAIROS Democracy Project.\n\nPresidential nominee Kamala Harris is being praised for her direct pitch to Black men after months of concern over the traditionally Democratic voters swaying toward the Republican Party - or staying home - this election cycle.\n\nWhile some Democratic circles have downplayed the worry over Black male voters, pointing out that Black men are the second most loyal voting bloc after Black women, others have fretted over various polling indicating a small but sizable shift of Black men supporting Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump .\n\n\"The issues that we care about more times than not are the same across people, but there's deeper urgency and greater responsibility for us to be focused when it comes to Black men,\" Michael Blake, a former Obama White House alum and CEO of KAIROS Democracy Project, told theGrio.\n\nOn Monday, Vice President Harris unveiled her \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" According to the Harris-Walz campaign, the comprehensive plan is primarily aimed at helping Black men secure financial freedom and lower costs to \"better provide for themselves and their families and protect their rights.\" Harris is proposing up to 1 million \"fully forgivable\" startup business loans for Black entrepreneurs and advancing the number of good-paying jobs in \"high-demand industries\" for Black men through education, training and mentorship programs. She also calls for a \"regulatory framework\" for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so that Black men's investments are protected.\n\nThe Kamala Harris plan for Black men goes further to address health care. The Democratic presidential nominee proposes launching a national health equity initiative focused on Black men, who are disproportionately impacted by mental health, prostate cancer, diabetes and other health challenges. Harris is also calling for the legalization of recreational marijuana and \"creating opportunities\" for Black Americans to \"succeed in this new industry.\"\n\n\"It is the most direct Black men policy I can recall of a presidential candidate,\" said Blake, who served in various roles in former President Barack Obama's administration and Obama's 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nBlake said Harris' proposals for Black men are a \"game changer.\"\n\n\"It is specific, it is clear, it is practical,\" he told theGrio. \"It will lead to us creating jobs, making money, saving lives and having justice.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said Harris' policy agenda reflects the kind of policies Black men \"wish they had a candidate who could speak to\" and that they are often talking about at the \"barbershop ... at the spades table, the fraternity meetings, after the basketball game at the rec center.\" \"It summarizes why she's a once-in-a-generation candidate,\" Seawright told theGrio.\n\nBy contrast, Democrats point out that Trump and Republicans have no substantive plan for Black men. In fact, they say Republican policies would cause them further harm.\n\n\"[Trump] has a deep, dark history of treating Black men like second-class citizens,\" said Seawright, noting Trump's calling for the Central Park Five to be executed for crimes they didn't commit and pushing the racist birther conspiracies about Obama, America's first Black president.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a walking and talking threat to Black men,\" he continued. \"Everything he has stood for, and everything he stands for literally, will undermine the progress that we made and jeopardize the Black family unit.\" Blake noted that Trump has taken credit for \"what other people did\" - namely Congress - including a stimulus check during the COVID-19 pandemic and criminal justice reform through the First Step Act. Even beyond that, Blake said, determining an election should be based on what you will do and not what you claim to have done.\n\n\"Can anyone actually say what [Trump] will actually do to help Black men?\" he queried. Blake continued, \"You have a Black woman who is laying out a policy for you to make money and to stay alive, [and] you have a continual racist white supremacist in Donald Trump who has literally called for the death of Black people and the destruction of Black communities .\"\n\nHarris has made direct appeals to Black men even before she emerged as the party's nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race . As vice president, Kamala Harris hosted Black male leaders at her Washington, D.C., residence and convened Black male entrepreneurs at the White House focused on helping them scale their businesses. She also embarked on an \" Economic Opportunity Tour \" to engage Black men across the country, inviting Black male celebrities like D.L. Hughley and Michael Ealy to participate.\n\nIn September, during a sit-down interview with the National Association for Black Journalists, theGrio asked Harris directly about concerns related to her support among Black men.\n\n\"Black men are like any other voting group; you've got to earn their vote,\" Harris told theGrio. \"So I'm working to earn the vote. Not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.\"\n\nSimilar to her agenda released on Monday, Kamala Harris said at the time that her approach is \"understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including Black men, to be able to achieve economic wealth.\" She added, \"I'm going to tell you I don't think it is sufficient to only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment.\"\n\nAs advocates travel the country engaging with Black male voters, they say that while Black men have real concerns about the direction of the country and where they fit in it, the concern about a flood of Black men running to the Republican Party is overblown.\n\n\"It's definitely not to the degree that's being said,\" noted Blake.\n\nSeawright, who agreed, said a \"large portion\" of the skepticism and cynicism of Black men toward Harris or the Democratic Party is the result of \"constant\" misinformation and disinformation.\n\n\"They're consuming their news and information, primarily on their devices and online,\" he lamented. However, Seawright warned that Black men who \"participate the least\" in the 2024 election are \"those who are impacted the most.\"\n\nSeawright said electing Harris and Democrats will also elevate prominent Black men in Congress who will ultimately center Black men and their communities, including U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , D-N.Y., who could become the first Black speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Democratic insider said voters also have the chance to elect a Black man, Rep. Colin Allred , to the U.S. Senate in Texas, and give Democrats the majority in the House, which would lead to more Black men in leadership positions, including Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who could become assistant speaker of the House.\n\n\"In every major social movement in the history of this world, Black men have always been on the front line ... and we've always stepped up to do our little Black jobs,\" said Seawright.\n\n\"The world is depending on us. The country is depending on us. The constitution is depending on us ... [and] our community is depending on us.\"\n\nWhy 'unplugged' weddings are trending and how to pull one off\n\n10 must-know African American nonprofits making a lasting impact\n\nWhat is International Day of the Girl, and why is it more important than ever?\n\nNorth West has mixed feelings about growing up in the spotlight\n\nDear Black women, it's Black Girl Day Off, so find your rest\n\nMore must-reads:\n\nHarris backs slashing medical debt.

      "text": "Who Are Black Men in Atlanta Voting For?\n\nManage your account\n\nAll eyes are on Georgia today, as months of campaigning come to a close in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are each vying for the Oval Office, focusing on Black men in the Peach State as a powerful voter demographic that could tip the scales in a crucial swing state.\n\nWhile polling data recorded last month showed less overall Black support for Harris than President Joe Biden received during his 2020 election campaign, a more-recent CBS News poll conducted by YouGov in early October determined 87% of Black likely voters would vote for Harris and just 12% would vote for Trump.\n\nAn NAACP survey taken late last month found support for Trump among Black men under 50 years old was declining, slipping 6 percentage points as compared to one month prior.\n\nCapital B Atlanta visited voting precincts in Vine City , Buckhead, and College Park to speak with Black male voters - many of whom said they had abortion rights and Project 2025 on their minds - about what drove them to the polls today and which candidate they chose in this race. Here's what they had to say.\n\nAlston, who voted at a precinct in College Park, said he cast a ballot for Harris and \"definitely not\" for Trump.\n\n\"He will send our world all the way back, and we've been making great progress. So for the Black men that are voting for Donald Trump, may God be with you, and we'll see how [Election Day] ends later on this evening,\" said Alston.\n\n\"The Project 2025 plan was not appealing to me at all. Kamala had an actual plan during the debate, so with that being said, I'm for Harris and Walz all the way.\"\n\nTyler said he went with Harris as his presidential pick and that he came out to the polls to exercise his \"constitutional right\" to vote.\n\n\"I wanted to have our constitution remain intact for the most part and for women to have the right to make decisions about their health and safety for their bodies,\" said Tyler.\n\n\"You just eliminate all the rhetoric that you hear prior to voting, and you vote based on the person that you think is gonna do the best job and have your best interests at heart.\"\n\nGarth said he voted for Trump in this election because he \"didn't trust\" Harris and felt aligned with the former president's policies.\n\n\"When Black men started saying they didn't like her, she started saying what she would do for us at the last minute,\" said Garth, referring to Harris' Opportunity Agenda for Black Men that she unveiled last month, following reports that Trump was gaining support from the voting bloc.\n\nGarth added that the economy is a \"big time\" reason why he voted for the former president, saying that \"Bidenomics suck.\"\n\n(The Black unemployment rate was at historically low levels last year, with wages for Black people increasing, according to Algernon Austin , director of race and economic justice at the Center for Economic Policy and Research.)\n\n\"We were getting more tax child credit at the time and money back for day care, and then all that was cut. I know a lot of that was cut when [Biden] came into office,\" said Garth. Harris has proposed an expansion of the child tax credit as part of her economic plan - similar to the credit that expanded under Biden in 2021 before the program shuttered the following year.\n\nSeck says he's voted in the past two elections but needed a nudge from his mother to get him out to the polls this time around.\n\n\"I'm kind of like a tweener,\" said Seck of his preference between Harris and Trump. \"I could see the good on both sides, but I'm still on the Kamala side because I feel like the stuff Trump be talking about, I ain't all the way in support of.\"\n\n\"What got me is when Trump said that he's going to make ... immunity for police . That's kind of what threw me. That was kind of why I said I'm going to come out and vote.\"\n\nLowther, who is a first-time voter, said he voted for Harris based on various anxieties he had regarding Trump's economic and abortion policies.\n\n\"I'm concerned about Trump giving tax exemptions to the upper 1% while Kamala Harris is giving the middle class tax breaks ,\" said Lowther.\n\nMoore said he voted for Harris because he feels the vice president would do a \"great job\" in the Oval Office. He said he had concerns that Trump may impact his civil rights.\n\nHe said both abortion rights and Project 2025 were reasons why he did not want to vote for Trump.\n\n\"You should have the right to make a choice with your body. The government should not have that type of control over you. So that's one reason why I don't understand why Black men are voting for Trump. That doesn't make sense,\" said Moore.\n\nHarris said he cast a ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, adding that having a woman as president would be the \"ultimate change\" the country needs right now.\n\n\"My biggest thing right now is the divisiveness that Trump brings to the table. It's very hard on every human being right now. People have anxiety for this election simply because they are afraid of what is going to happen,\" said Harris.\n\n\"We need a new way, and it's time for a new light. This country has never fathomed the thought of a woman running this country, but you know what? A woman running this country will be the biggest and best thing right now.\"\n\nThe post Who Are Black Men in Atlanta Voting For? appeared first on Capital B News - Atlanta ."

      "text": "Win With Black Men Call Raises Over $1M For Kamala Harris' 2024 Presidential Campaign\n\nManage your account\n\nBlack women and men are standing on the front line to back Kamala Harris ' 2024 presidential campaign. Earlier this week, Black men in particular raised $1.3 million in donations for the Vice President.\n\nAs Blavity reported, the organization Win With Black Women spearheaded a call on July 21, the same day President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the upcoming presidential election. The WWBW collective not only discussed issues affecting Black women, but it raised funds for Harris' campaign . The Zoom call had 44,000 participants - and they made history by accumulating $1.5 million in just three hours.\n\nInspired by the assembly of the group, journalist Roland Martin and his Black Star Network joined the cause with a \"Win With Black Men\" call the next day, according to Essence . Over 20,000 Black men participated in the call with 17,000 of them donating to Harris' campaign.\n\nSoon after the rally began, it was already at capacity, which led Martin to livestream it on YouTube so that others could participate. Elated about how the call with the men nationwide went, he tweeted the following: \"I have no words. And not just because I'm tired. My @BlkStarNetwork just told me that 53,862 people registered for our #WinWithBlackMen video call. We raised $1.3M and counting from 17,000 donors.\"\n\nPer Essence, Martin said all the money collected \"will go to the Harris campaign, as well as to grassroots organizations run by Black men in battleground states.\"\n\nSpecial guests included celebrities, community leaders and government officials, including Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock.\n\n\"This moment will go down in history when the brothers got together to say we are all in for the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris,\" Warnock said, according to Essence.\n\nHe added, \"Don't let anybody slow us down asking the question 'Can a Black woman be elected president of the United States.' Kamala Harris can win. We just have to show up. History is watching us, and the future is waiting on us.\"\n\nSharing Warnock's sentiments, Moore spoke on the power of collaboration.\n\n\"When we mobilize, we win. We move mountains,\" he said. \"For Kamala Harris, who has stood by us, lifted us up, and supported us, it is important that she knows that she has an army behind her.\"\n\nBakari Sellers, a CNN political analyst and former South Carolina politician, also spoke to the importance of Black men uplifting Harris at this time despite any differences in perspectives given the current political climate.\n\n\"Let's protect Kamala. Let's be with her like she was there for us,\" Sellers said on the call. \"We are going to disagree a lot. But let's put the petty bickering aside. Let's stand up and be the Black men who change this country. We built this country. I'm rocking with Kamala.\""

      "text": "US airline suspends staff after black men kicked off flight\n\nSeveral American Airlines employees have been put on leave for their involvement in an incident in which black passengers were removed from a flight after a complaint about body odour.\n\nThree passengers filed a lawsuit against the carrier in May, alleging racial discrimination in the 5 January incident.\n\nIn a note to employees, CEO Robert Isom said that the incident was unacceptable and that the company \"fell short\" of its commitment to customers.\n\n\"We are holding those involved accountable, including removing team members from service,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nThe company has also announced a number of initiatives aimed at preventing such incidents from taking place, including an \"advisory group\" focused on the experience of black passengers.\n\nIn the May lawsuit, three men - who were not seated together and did not know each other - said that every black man was removed from the flight between Phoenix, Arizona and New York City.\n\nA total of eight passengers were removed.\n\n\"American Airlines singled us out for being black, embarrassed us, and humiliated us,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThe three men - Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph, and Xavier Veal - were eventually allowed to re-take their seats on their original flight.\n\nIn a letter to employees dated 18 June, Mr Isom said he was \"incredibly disappointed by what happened on the flight and the breakdown of our procedures\".\n\n\"We fell short of our commitments and failed our customers,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the airline is \"steadfast in our commitment\" to working with civil rights organisations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, to \"rebuild trust\".\n\nThe incident is not the first time that American Airlines has faced allegations of discrimination.\n\nIn a separate incident in 2017, the NAACP warned black travellers to avoid the airline, citing a pattern of \"disrespectful\" and \"discriminatory\" behaviour as well as a \"corporate culture of racial insensitivity and possible racial bias\".\n\nThey lifted the advisory the following year after the carrier announced it had made changes to its operations.\n\nOn 4 June this year, however, it warned that it could reinstate the warning unless American gave a \"swift and decisive response\" to the January incident.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nA spokesperson says they expect services to be resumed on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Obama urges black men to mobilise behind Harris\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama has made an impassioned plea to black men to get behind the Democratic nominee.\n\nIn an unannounced stop at a Harris campaign field office in the swing state of Pennsylvania, he chided male voters \"coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses\" not to support a woman for president.\n\nObama later mocked Donald Trump for \"crazy conspiracy theories, the two-hour speeches, word salad\" as he debuted on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Republican nominee spoke in battleground Michigan, warning of \"a mess\" for the whole country if Harris is elected.\n\nWith only 25 days to go until election night in America, the presidential race is as tight as ever - and a winner will likely be determined by ballots in a handful of closely contested states in the mid-west and south-west.\n\nHarris has been seeking to shore up support among black voters, but a poll by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in September indicated that one in four black men under 50 said they would support Trump over Harris in November.\n\nObama, the nation's first black president, suggested that sexism was at play for why hesitation \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers\".\n\n\"I've got a problem with that,\" he said. \"Because part of it makes me think - and I'm speaking to men directly - part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nRunning through Harris's policy proposals, Obama added she was \"somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences\", while Trump \"has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person\".\n\nBut Democrat Nina Turner, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate, questioned why black men were \"being lectured to\" and \"belittled in ways that no other voting group is\".\n\n\"Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong,\" Turner told CNN.\n\nThe ex-president remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party and, headlining a Harris campaign rally in Pittsburgh later, he sought to energise supporters with a sharp-tongued attack on Trump.\n\nComparing him at one point to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Obama said \"Trump's behaviour, the bullying and the putting people down... is not what real strength is and has never been\".\n\n\"Get off your couch and vote. Put down your phone and vote. Grab your friends and family and vote,\" he said.\n\nHarris herself campaigned on Thursday in Nevada, where she is trying to boost support among Latino voters who could tip the contest in her favour there.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump brought his own campaign message to Detroit, Michigan's largest city and a hub of US auto manufacturing.\n\nAddressing an audience at the Detroit Economic Club, he spoke for over an hour about a wide range of topics from voting rules to tariffs on China, with much of his speech focused on a claim that the domestic auto industry is failing.\n\nHe accused the Biden-Harris administration of \"destroying our country\", adding that several years of weak leadership had allowed large companies to \"come in and raid and rape our country\".\n\nTrump also presented a new policy of tax deductions on auto loan interest, one in a flurry of populist-friendly economic proposals he has suggested in the closing stretch of the campaign.\n\nBut the remarks were overshadowed by a moment in which the three-time Republican candidate bashed the city he was in and from whose voters he is seeking support.\n\n\"I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on [Harris's] list. The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth?\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands.\"\n\nState and local leaders slammed the comments, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer defending the city as \"the epitome of 'grit,' defined by winners willing to get their hands dirty to build up their city and create their communities - something Donald Trump could never understand\".\n\n\"So keep Detroit out of your mouth. And you better believe Detroiters won't forget this in November,\" Whitmer, a Harris ally, said.\n\nThe Trump campaign later clarified to US media that Trump was arguing the city had \"suffered from globalist policies championed by Kamala Harris\" and that \"his policies will usher in a new era of economic success and stability for Detroit, helping the city reach its fullest potential\".\n\nOn Friday, Trump will home in on illegal immigration - a topic that polls suggest voters trust him to handle better than Harris - as he visits Aurora, Colorado - a city that some Republicans have claimed is being overrun by Venezuelan migrant gangs.\n\nHe will also speak in Nevada, while Harris plans to speak in adjoining Arizona.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here . Those outside the UK can sign up here.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Obama urges black men to mobilise behind Harris\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama has made an impassioned plea to black men to get behind the Democratic nominee.\n\nIn an unannounced stop at a Harris campaign field office in the swing state of Pennsylvania, he chided male voters \"coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses\" not to support a woman for president.\n\nObama later mocked Donald Trump for \"crazy conspiracy theories, the two-hour speeches, word salad\" as he debuted on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Republican nominee spoke in battleground Michigan, warning of \"a mess\" for the whole country if Harris is elected.\n\nWith only 25 days to go until election night in America, the presidential race is as tight as ever - and a winner will likely be determined by ballots in a handful of closely contested states in the mid-west and south-west.\n\nHarris has been seeking to shore up support among black voters, but a poll by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in September indicated that one in four black men under 50 said they would support Trump over Harris in November.\n\nObama, the nation's first black president, suggested that sexism was at play for why hesitation \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers\".\n\n\"I've got a problem with that,\" he said. \"Because part of it makes me think - and I'm speaking to men directly - part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nRunning through Harris's policy proposals, Obama added she was \"somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences\", while Trump \"has consistently shown disregard, not just for the communities, but for you as a person\".\n\nBut Democrat Nina Turner, a former Bernie Sanders surrogate, questioned why black men were \"being lectured to\" and \"belittled in ways that no other voting group is\".\n\n\"Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong,\" Turner told CNN.\n\nThe ex-president remains a popular figure within the Democratic Party and, headlining a Harris campaign rally in Pittsburgh later, he sought to energise supporters with a sharp-tongued attack on Trump.\n\nComparing him at one point to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Obama said \"Trump's behaviour, the bullying and the putting people down... is not what real strength is and has never been\".\n\n\"Get off your couch and vote. Put down your phone and vote. Grab your friends and family and vote,\" he said.\n\nHarris herself campaigned on Thursday in Nevada, where she is trying to boost support among Latino voters who could tip the contest in her favour there.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump brought his own campaign message to Detroit, Michigan's largest city and a hub of US auto manufacturing.\n\nAddressing an audience at the Detroit Economic Club, he spoke for over an hour about a wide range of topics from voting rules to tariffs on China, with much of his speech focused on a claim that the domestic auto industry is failing.\n\nHe accused the Biden-Harris administration of \"destroying our country\", adding that several years of weak leadership had allowed large companies to \"come in and raid and rape our country\".\n\nTrump also presented a new policy of tax deductions on auto loan interest, one in a flurry of populist-friendly economic proposals he has suggested in the closing stretch of the campaign.\n\nBut the remarks were overshadowed by a moment in which the three-time Republican candidate bashed the city he was in and from whose voters he is seeking support.\n\n\"I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on [Harris's] list. The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth?\" he said.\n\n\"It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands.\"\n\nState and local leaders slammed the comments, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer defending the city as \"the epitome of 'grit,' defined by winners willing to get their hands dirty to build up their city and create their communities - something Donald Trump could never understand\".\n\n\"So keep Detroit out of your mouth. And you better believe Detroiters won't forget this in November,\" Whitmer, a Harris ally, said.\n\nThe Trump campaign later clarified to US media that Trump was arguing the city had \"suffered from globalist policies championed by Kamala Harris\" and that \"his policies will usher in a new era of economic success and stability for Detroit, helping the city reach its fullest potential\".\n\nOn Friday, Trump will home in on illegal immigration - a topic that polls suggest voters trust him to handle better than Harris - as he visits Aurora, Colorado - a city that some Republicans have claimed is being overrun by Venezuelan migrant gangs.\n\nHe will also speak in Nevada, while Harris plans to speak in adjoining Arizona.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

Those outside the UK can sign up here.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

For Black men specifically, this couldn't be more true.\n\nBillionaire hip-hop mogul Jay-Z espouses the importance of therapy in a Netflix interview with former talk show host David Letterman. Charlamagne Tha God, a host of the nationally syndicated radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" is a strong proponent of mental health awareness and destigmatizing it in Black communities. He often shares his personal battles with anxiety.\n\nWhen comedian Marlon Wayans served as the guest host for Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" this spring, he implored guests and viewers to donate to a Philadelphia area nonprofit that specializes in introducing Black men to therapy.\n\nStigma and lack of affordability around mental health in vulnerable communities can hinder progress. A Philadelphia-area nonprofit seeks to help one segment of the population heal.\n\nBlack Men Heal is a 5-year-old organization that has been increasingly part of the conversation about Black men and mental health, specifically in a time of upheaval in America. The group, which also curates programming for people of color, is the brainchild of founder Tasnim Sulaiman, a licensed therapist who ran her own private practice before she started Black Men Heal.\n\n\"I had clients - Black men - who all started coming to me with some of the same problems, and I started to see a pattern,\" Ms. Sulaiman says.\n\nDuring her private sessions with clients, recurring problems kept manifesting: unresolved childhood trauma, absentee fathers missing from their lives, and frustration from having to traverse a larger world full of societal ills. She helped many of her clients resolve marital, professional, and personal problems. But she was only one person, and every Black man in Philadelphia didn't have the same income as the men who sat down across from her.\n\n\"I started to wonder how many other Black men were feeling like this but weren't going to therapy. My clients were well-to-do men who could afford to pay $150 [per visit] or they had jobs with good insurance,\" she says.\n\nA picture of how she envisioned Black Men Heal came to her one day while out jogging, and she got to work. She had already started doing pro bono work for some financially strapped individuals, but she saw that the number of Black men in need was much higher. Her goal was to offer multiple free sessions and pair the men with culturally sensitive therapists, perhaps Black men, who could build rapport with them and establish trust. She had a daughter to raise and bills of her own as a newly divorced woman, so she couldn't offer all of her services for free. But she could gather a community of like-minded people to address the issue, she thought.\n\n\"I knew other people who were therapists. I told them what I was trying to do but that I couldn't pay them,\" Ms. Sulaiman says. \"Since I like to cook, I told them that I could cook for them,\" she says during a Zoom call, pointing from her kitchen to the dining room table of her home.\n\nThey bought into her idea and started to offer pro bono therapy. Black men also bought into the idea. Today Black Men Heal offers eight free sessions to new participants and seeks to destigmatize therapy and eliminate costs. If participants wish to continue therapy, they can if their insurance covers it or if they can afford it out of pocket.\n\nBlack Men Heal has a 75% continuation rate among participants. It hosts virtual Sunday sessions called Kings Corner, where Black men from across the country gather on Zoom to talk about healing. In five years, Black Men Heal has served 3,567 men, between individual therapy and Kings Corner sessions, with 1,642 new individuals participating in 2022. Since starting in 2018, the organization has expanded its list of providers beyond Pennsylvania to Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, the District of Columbia, New York, Virginia, and Georgia.\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, Black Men Heal has inspired local organizations and has been recognized for its community work. Film director Muhammad Bilal credited his time in counseling through Black Men Heal with helping him work through personal issues. He went further and created a 48-minute film, \"Perdido,\" about mental health. He premiered the film and participated in a panel discussion about it, led by Ms. Sulaiman, at a Community Mental Health Awareness Day in West Philadelphia in early May.\n\nChapter leaders at African American Greek Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, Pi Gamma Sigma Alumni Chapter, wanted to shine a light on the work that Ms. Sulaiman was doing. They named Black Men Heal the nonprofit business of the year in 2019 at their Bigger and Better Business ceremony. They also are debuting a new initiative this year, My Brother's Keeper, where they want to send alumni fraternity members - no questions asked - to the organization for counseling for mental health wellness.\n\n\"As Black men, or men in general, we keep quiet about stuff when we shouldn't, and for her to tackle that, that was big. There's a lot going on in the world today,\" says William Streeter, who chaired the board that nominated Black Men Heal for the award. \"She's definitely making a difference and it's slowly growing, because we've been watching for a while. We figured we could help support her by sending a few people her way.\"\n\nParticipation in Black Men Heal grew tremendously during the pandemic. Ms. Sulaiman says the ability to offer counseling sessions virtually, which is how the sessions are done now, helped more men connect with the organization.\n\nLeBrian Brown was a pandemic convert to Black Men Heal, after a series of setbacks almost drove him to his breaking point. \"We had just lost a baby,\" he says. \"My wife got laid off from work. It was during COVID. I was just depressed, man.\"\n\nHe was crushed after seeing George Floyd's murder online and participated in multiple protests, he says. His family went from two incomes to surviving on the $40,000 he made working at a Philadelphia nonprofit that serviced unhoused people.\n\n\"I just felt like I couldn't continue on,\" he adds.\n\nHis wife heard about Black Men Heal through a friend and suggested that he apply for a lottery they had to accept new patients. He and several of his friends wrote to the organization for free therapy and he heard back within days.\n\n\"When I came into Black Men Heal, it was like a breath of fresh air,\" Mr. Brown says. \"The therapist took me all the way back to problems with my dad, and problems with my hometown [Trenton, New Jersey], and just problems with me not believing in myself, all the way to the point where I am now. And it just freed me from a lot of those demons,\" Mr. Brown says.\n\nHis therapist gave him homework, having him write letters to people and address his trauma. He stopped therapy after his 12 free sessions because he said that he wanted to test to see if he was strong enough to incorporate what he'd learned into his daily life.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

So they created an Education Promise Fund.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 06, 2016, 6:33 p.m. ET | Waterloo, Iowa\n\nIn 2006, Dennis Harbaugh and Juanita Williams made a promise to a class of second-graders at Dr. Walter Cunningham School for Excellence in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nIf the 17 African-American boys stayed in school and graduated, they would be eligible for a two-year college scholarship through the Harbaugh-Williams Education Promise Fund, The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported .\n\nA decade later, 10 of the young men are on track to keep their end of the bargain. Last week, five graduated from East High School, and three graduated from West High School. Two others who moved away also have graduated.\n\nMost of the remaining students are still working to earn the credits they will need to graduate. Some may finish up by the end of the summer while others hope to be done within the next year.\n\nThe Waterloo couple had mortgaged an apartment building they owned to start the fund and then began seeking donations from the community. Two years ago, they reached their goal and have more than $330,000 available.\n\nScholarships will be equivalent to as much as the highest tuition and fees at Iowa's three public universities. Students can defer their scholarship if they start at a community college and then transfer to a more expensive four-year institution. Harbaugh estimated recipients will receive a maximum of $7,000 to $8,000 each year.\n\nHe and his wife chose the students in Cunningham teacher Jeff Ferguson's single-gender class as beneficiaries. Ferguson's class, which stayed with him through fifth grade, was part of a pilot program started the year before at the elementary school in the heart of the city's black community.\n\nThe intent was to tailor instruction and remove distractions by separating the sexes with the hope of raising Cunningham's lagging achievement.\n\nDeQuann Washington, one of the graduating East students, called the couple's decision \"life-changing\" for him.\n\n\"When I was little, I didn't know what a scholarship was,\" he noted. \"They said, 'You lucky. You blessed.' Now I know what they meant.\"\n\nHarbaugh, a former University of Northern Iowa employee who retired because of a disability, and Williams, a registered nurse, were concerned with the achievement gap faced by black males in Waterloo schools and how that related to dropout and graduation rates.\n\nThe spring before they started the fund, only 37.6 percent of black males in Waterloo's class of 2005 graduated.\n\n\"It really got our attention,\" said Harbaugh. \"There's no way to have a strong community when you have a subgroup of the community that's not graduating from high school. That's just not going to work.\"\n\nAlong with setting up the fund, the couple met regularly with the students and their parents, building a support network around them.\n\nCounseling sessions helped the boys to set goals and deal with difficulties they encountered in life. Volunteer mentors were assigned to meet weekly with each of them during school. Field trips were planned, including many to colleges and universities.\n\nAs they prepare to graduate, the importance of those efforts is not lost on the Promise Fund students, who dubbed themselves \"Brothers of Knowledge for College\" years ago.\n\n\"It's a great experience, especially where most of us came from,\" said Samonti Tooson, who is graduating from East.\n\nHe noted his father didn't finish high school. Washington said neither his mom or dad is a high school graduate. \"We get to break the cycle,\" Tooson said.\n\nJust knowing a scholarship has his name on it helped Anthony Ross of West High School. He has taken some dual-enrollment classes to earn college credit.\n\n\"Having the high expectations from other people\" challenged Ross to succeed, he said. \"It pushed us to do what we got to do to take care of our business.\"\n\nTooson added, \"It was pressure, but it was good pressure.\"\n\nGroup members detailed some of their academic difficulties. Shuntavion Porter, who is graduating from East, initially had trouble earning the credits required to stay on track for graduation.\n\n\"I messed up on my ninth- and 10th-grade credits and picked it up in 11th grade,\" he said.\n\nPorter finished his final class in the credit recovery program last week.\n\nSome admitted regrets about their academic efforts in high school.\n\n\"Over the years, I wish my grades would be better,\" said Davion Givens, who is graduating from East. \"I wish I would have looked up my freshman year and said, 'Let's get down to business.' \"\n\nTooson struggled with math and recently completed geometry, the final class he needed in the subject. He talked about how important it became to not give up and accomplish graduation requirements.\n\n\"Basically, it was disrespect if I didn't ... to myself, to Dennis and Juanita, and the supporters,\" he said. \"I feel like they reached out as much as they could and the rest is up to us.\"\n\nMike Robinson, who formerly owned a counseling service, facilitated regular group support sessions for the students. He now works as a teacher in the Iowa Jobs for America's Graduates program at East.\n\n\"I came in to provide a level of guidance and stability,\" said Robinson, who is black. The idea was to provide \"consistent support\" for the boys. \"They knew that when they put this together that the odds weren't in these young men's favor.\"\n\nThe boys would set goals for themselves and talk about how to reach them.\n\n\"We all talk about what we need to do,\" said Ross. \"That's one of the things that helped me, and my momma. My momma's a big supporter.\"\n\nShe didn't let him forget the opportunity he had been given.\n\n\"I am going to do my job as a mom, to stay on my kids,\" said Ross' mother, Laquonedrian Jones, who has two other sons. \"Their education is their future. They have to stay focused and graduate.\"\n\nOthers from the group graduating this week are East student Damonte Thornton and West students Ashanti Williams and Alizae Taylor. In addition, group member Kevin Martin Jr. and Zachariah Harrison have graduated after moving out of Iowa.\n\nMartin, who moved to Minnesota a couple of years ago to enroll in Job Corps, graduated from that program with a diploma in December. He is working as a certified nursing assistant and preparing to go to college. Harrison graduated from high school Wednesday after moving to California last summer.\n\nHarbaugh said those graduating have applied to at least one college and been accepted. Many plan to attend Hawkeye Community College and are interested in nursing or another related medical field.\n\nWhile the district doesn't have recent graduation and dropout rate information available for black males, African-American students overall lag behind their peers.\n\nThe Grades 7-12 dropout rate for all black students during 2013-14, the most recent year data are available, was 6.09 percent. For all district students in those grades, it was 3.92 percent. Waterloo reached an all-time high of 80.3 percent of students graduating in the class of 2015; for black students that number was 74.9 percent.\n\nAmong group members not graduating this week are several no longer attending classes in the Waterloo Schools. One is completing classes from the Black Hawk County Jail and is expected to eventually earn a diploma from the district. Another is working toward his high school equivalency diploma while serving time in Anamosa State Penitentiary.\n\n\"He's absolutely going to turn his life around,\" said Harbaugh, noting the teen has already passed several of the subject tests for the diploma. \"The day he steps out of Anamosa, we're going to be there with him and help him reach his higher education dreams. He'll be out hopefully in a couple years, and he'll still have his whole adult life ahead of him.\"\n\nThe final student has \"fallen away in the last year and a half,\" said Harbaugh. \"He's working, but not a student. I'm not giving up on him, either.\"\n\nHe added, \"Fortunately, those type of situations are in the minority and most of the guys have made really good decisions over the years.\"\n\nGroup member Tyriq O'Neal, a West student who expects to complete his credit requirements during the next year, said he began having trouble during the transition from middle school.\n\n\"Coming into high school there were a lot of challenges,\" said O'Neal, noting he slacked off and played the class clown. \"When I first came into (high school) I wasn't doing no kind of work.\"\n\nAfter nearly dropping out last year, \"I just had to dig deep,\" he said. \"I went from 19 credits to 39.\" Students need 44 credits to graduate.\n\n\"I've been really given a golden opportunity to do something with my life,\" said O'Neal, expressing gratitude for the scholarship effort.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

An education gap, criminal records, and racial bias all contribute to problems in the job market, experts say. What type of intervention would help?\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 26, 2011, 2:05 p.m. ET | Philadelphia\n\nThe jobs landscape is bleak for any unemployed American, but for black men it's virtually a desert.\n\nFor them, the Great Recession not only led to the largest increase in unemployment for any category of American worker, but it also is pinching a lot longer. About 1 in 6 black men over age 20 in the labor force is jobless - and that number has barely improved since the economic recovery officially began two years ago.\n\nIn Detroit , Las Vegas , Milwaukee , Min­neap­olis-St. Paul, and several other US cities, Depression-era unemployment rates above 20 percent beset the black community, estimates one economic policy group, citing government data. Moreover, the problem may get worse because city governments, which traditionally employ many African-American men, are laying off workers to cope with budget shortfalls, say experts on black employment.\n\nThe change has been dramatic. The jobless rate, 7.5 percent in prerecession days, is now 17 percent - more than double the rate for white men. The ramifications are dramatic: a slide out of the middle class; greater dependence on public assistance; new strain on families, including the challenge of meeting mortgage or child-support payments; and more homelessness.\n\nUS Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D) of Mis­souri, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , sees a long-term travesty for the whole nation if intervention is not redoubled to address the scourge of black unemployment. \"The failure of this nation to address this problem will lead to another 25 years of problems in this country based on race,\" he says in a phone interview. \"We ignore this crisis at our national peril - on the agenda are poverty, medical problems, crime, you name it.\"\n\nBlack men find it harder to land jobs for many reasons. Competition is fierce - in June, 4.7 unemployed job seekers for every opening - and a single blemish on a résumé can mean an employer will choose someone else. Among other hurdles for African-American men:\n\n•A disproportionate number have criminal records. Black men are incarcerated at more than six times the rate of white men and 2.6 times the rate of His­panic men, reports Human Rights Watch .\n\n•Fewer have college degrees, which are a big bonus in the job market. Among men, 17.9 percent of blacks over 25 have college degrees, compared with 34.2 percent of whites, according to the National Center for Education Statistics .\n\n•Semiskilled jobs and unskilled jobs, which are often filled by those without a college education, are on the decline.\n\n•Federal spending is likely to shrink, including funding for programs aimed at reducing black joblessness.\n\n•Racism persists in hiring and firing despite antidiscrimination laws, studies show.\n\nNate Robinson of Philadelphia lost his job to the recession - and he's been struggling ever since. He was selling cars at a General Motors dealership that closed in 2009 when the auto giant entered bankruptcy and went through a restructuring.\n\n\"When I got hired, the [dealership's] manager said, 'You are going to help put GM back on the map,' \" he recalls. \"After they went out of business, it was kind of hard to get back into it.\"\n\nWhile he looks for work - sometimes finding temp jobs - Mr. Robinson tries to survive on welfare. An inability to find permanent work led to personal problems and substance abuse, but for the past nine months he has been drug-free, he says.\n\nUnemployment has pushed him out of the middle class and into poverty: The welfare checks total $102.50 every two weeks. \"So I have no money in my pocket,\" he says. \"But I'm not complaining. I know God has something out there for me.\"\n\nRobinson now bemoans the fact that he never went to college.\n\nThe 'education gap'\n\nThe education gap is what stands out to John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C. It makes black men more vulnerable to job loss, he says. \"We know the unemployment rate for college graduates is 4.5 percent,\" says Mr. Silvia. \"A lot of black men do not have a college degree, and because of the changing nature of the workforce - oriented more toward education, finance, and IT [information technology] - they don't fit into the jobs that are available.\"\n\nThe disparity in college education between black men and other prospective hires has persisted for the past 10 years and is especially glaring in the sciences. \"African-Americans are incredibly underrepresented in these fields,\" says Betsey Stevenson , a Labor Department economist. Only 3 percent of black men work in professional, scientific, and technical services, where job growth is occurring, according to government figures.\n\nMath and science were never his strong suits, says Craig James of Philadelphia, who is looking for work. But he envisions himself going back to school, perhaps for computer courses, once he lands a job. He graduated from high school three years ago. The main impediment to continuing his education now is that he is a single parent of a young son.\n\n\"I know you've got to learn to use technology,\" says Mr. James, who was laid off last year from a job in the security industry because, he acknowledges, he \"messed up\" by not following all company rules and by arriving late to work. His last job was talking to students about the value of an education for the nonprofit group Mothers In Charge. The group scaled back when some of its funding from the Obama stimulus package ran out.\n\nNow, with 3-year-old Zakia to care for, James says he has become more responsible. \"My son made me stronger,\" says James, who lives with his parents and Zakia in North Philadelphia . He's looking for work but says he is frustrated that he has had no callbacks.\n\nCriminal records and discrimination\n\nBy the time they were 30, 22 percent of black men born between 1965 and 1969 had been incarcerated, compared with 3 percent of white men the same age, according to one study. And surveys show that a majority of employers are reluctant to hire someone with a criminal record.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) held a commission meeting to examine whether criminal background checks were adversely affecting the job prospects of workers of color. In 1990, the EEOC concluded that \"an employer may not base an employment decision on the conviction record of an applicant or employee absent business necessity.\" According to the National Employment Law Project that means employers must take into account reasonable factors such as the age and seriousness of the offense in relation to the specific job at issue\n\nOn a recent morning at a career center on New York 's Staten Island , Jamal Lump ­kin, who left prison in September after serving 10 years for drug-related crimes, recounts his job-seeking experience. He says several interviews went well - until the employer asked about criminal background.\n\n\"When we get out, nobody wants to give us an opportunity,\" says Mr. Lumpkin. He has started to feel desperate, he says.\n\nEmployers' perceptions about criminality among black men may even affect job prospects for African-American men who have never done time. One study found that black men without criminal ­records \"have as much difficulty [getting hired] as white males with a criminal record,\" says Algernon Austin of the Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy at the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington think tank. \"And black males with a criminal record are worse off than black males without one.\"\n\nDiscrimination remains an issue, too. When a Chicago fair employment group sent out \"matched pairs\" - that is, white and black people with the same credentials - whites were offered jobs 16 percent more often than African-Americans were, says Christine Owens of the NELP, which advocates on behalf of the jobless.\n\nMunicipal jobs, which many African-Americans see as a haven from racial bias, are in short supply these days. There are 430,000 fewer government jobs since the recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department's Ms. Stevenson.\n\n\"We have flocked to government by the throngs,\" says Congressman Cleaver, \"because it represented opportunity and a place where you are least likely to experience racial bigotry.\"\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThe Obama administration - which is, after all, led by an African-American man - is hardly oblivious to lingering racial bias in the workplace or soaring black male unemployment. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , in a phone interview, says she has beefed up her department's investigative division, which deals with workplace bias and other illegal practices. \"We have almost doubled and tripled investigations,\" says Ms. Solis, compared with 2008 levels.\n\nShe outlines some Labor Department efforts to help connect unemployed African-Americans with better jobs:\n\n•Job Corps, an education and training program for young people. Some 78 percent of people who complete the program land a job in fewer than nine months, Solis says.\n\n•A pilot program for military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It sets aside 300 slots for veterans at Job Corps centers in Indiana , Kentucky , and Missouri that serve large minority populations.\n\n•A partnership with the Department of Justice to provide job and mental-health counseling to federal and state inmates before they are released. \"Once [former convicts] get hired, companies find they are some of the most loyal employees,\" says Solis.\n\n•A push to give federal incentives to companies that scale back employees' hours rather than lay off workers. The administration backs such \"work share\" legislation, saying it preserves jobs and opens up more job opportunities, including those for black men.\n\nIn Congress, meanwhile, black lawmakers are \"moderately\" optimistic about a bill that would funnel US grant money to parts of the country that have seen 30 years of high poverty levels. US grantmaking agencies would target 20 percent of such funds to those areas, says Cleaver. Key Republicans with whom he has met have no objection to the legislation, he says. \"There are about 80 congressional districts where there are such areas,\" he says.\n\nStill, these days Congress is cutting more programs than it is adding. And it has yet to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act , which sends money to states, cities, and counties for job training and counseling.\n\nFrustrated by Washington's slow pace at addressing job creation, the Congressional Black Caucus plans to bring job fairs to five cities - Cleveland , Atlanta , Detroit, Miami , and Los Angeles - starting Aug. 8. It has lined up companies to attend and hopes to see 10,000 workers hired as a result. \"Realizing [that the US in June] only created 18,000 new jobs, this is a pretty big number,\" says Cleaver.\n\n• Patrick Wall in New York contributed to this report.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For Black men specifically, this couldn't be more true.\n\nBillionaire hip-hop mogul Jay-Z espouses the importance of therapy in a Netflix interview with former talk show host David Letterman. Charlamagne Tha God, a host of the nationally syndicated radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" is a strong proponent of mental health awareness and destigmatizing it in Black communities. He often shares his personal battles with anxiety.\n\nWhen comedian Marlon Wayans served as the guest host for Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" this spring, he implored guests and viewers to donate to a Philadelphia area nonprofit that specializes in introducing Black men to therapy.\n\nStigma and lack of affordability around mental health in vulnerable communities can hinder progress. A Philadelphia-area nonprofit seeks to help one segment of the population heal.\n\nBlack Men Heal is a 5-year-old organization that has been increasingly part of the conversation about Black men and mental health, specifically in a time of upheaval in America. The group, which also curates programming for people of color, is the brainchild of founder Tasnim Sulaiman, a licensed therapist who ran her own private practice before she started Black Men Heal.\n\n\"I had clients - Black men - who all started coming to me with some of the same problems, and I started to see a pattern,\" Ms. Sulaiman says.\n\nDuring her private sessions with clients, recurring problems kept manifesting: unresolved childhood trauma, absentee fathers missing from their lives, and frustration from having to traverse a larger world full of societal ills. She helped many of her clients resolve marital, professional, and personal problems. But she was only one person, and every Black man in Philadelphia didn't have the same income as the men who sat down across from her.\n\n\"I started to wonder how many other Black men were feeling like this but weren't going to therapy. My clients were well-to-do men who could afford to pay $150 [per visit] or they had jobs with good insurance,\" she says.\n\nA picture of how she envisioned Black Men Heal came to her one day while out jogging, and she got to work. She had already started doing pro bono work for some financially strapped individuals, but she saw that the number of Black men in need was much higher. Her goal was to offer multiple free sessions and pair the men with culturally sensitive therapists, perhaps Black men, who could build rapport with them and establish trust. She had a daughter to raise and bills of her own as a newly divorced woman, so she couldn't offer all of her services for free. But she could gather a community of like-minded people to address the issue, she thought.\n\n\"I knew other people who were therapists. I told them what I was trying to do but that I couldn't pay them,\" Ms. Sulaiman says. \"Since I like to cook, I told them that I could cook for them,\" she says during a Zoom call, pointing from her kitchen to the dining room table of her home.\n\nThey bought into her idea and started to offer pro bono therapy. Black men also bought into the idea. Today Black Men Heal offers eight free sessions to new participants and seeks to destigmatize therapy and eliminate costs. If participants wish to continue therapy, they can if their insurance covers it or if they can afford it out of pocket.\n\nBlack Men Heal has a 75% continuation rate among participants. It hosts virtual Sunday sessions called Kings Corner, where Black men from across the country gather on Zoom to talk about healing. In five years, Black Men Heal has served 3,567 men, between individual therapy and Kings Corner sessions, with 1,642 new individuals participating in 2022. Since starting in 2018, the organization has expanded its list of providers beyond Pennsylvania to Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, the District of Columbia, New York, Virginia, and Georgia.\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, Black Men Heal has inspired local organizations and has been recognized for its community work. Film director Muhammad Bilal credited his time in counseling through Black Men Heal with helping him work through personal issues. He went further and created a 48-minute film, \"Perdido,\" about mental health. He premiered the film and participated in a panel discussion about it, led by Ms. Sulaiman, at a Community Mental Health Awareness Day in West Philadelphia in early May.\n\nChapter leaders at African American Greek Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, Pi Gamma Sigma Alumni Chapter, wanted to shine a light on the work that Ms. Sulaiman was doing. They named Black Men Heal the nonprofit business of the year in 2019 at their Bigger and Better Business ceremony. They also are debuting a new initiative this year, My Brother's Keeper, where they want to send alumni fraternity members - no questions asked - to the organization for counseling for mental health wellness.\n\n\"As Black men, or men in general, we keep quiet about stuff when we shouldn't, and for her to tackle that, that was big. There's a lot going on in the world today,\" says William Streeter, who chaired the board that nominated Black Men Heal for the award. \"She's definitely making a difference and it's slowly growing, because we've been watching for a while. We figured we could help support her by sending a few people her way.\"\n\nParticipation in Black Men Heal grew tremendously during the pandemic. Ms. Sulaiman says the ability to offer counseling sessions virtually, which is how the sessions are done now, helped more men connect with the organization.\n\nLeBrian Brown was a pandemic convert to Black Men Heal, after a series of setbacks almost drove him to his breaking point. \"We had just lost a baby,\" he says. \"My wife got laid off from work. It was during COVID. I was just depressed, man.\"\n\nHe was crushed after seeing George Floyd's murder online and participated in multiple protests, he says. His family went from two incomes to surviving on the $40,000 he made working at a Philadelphia nonprofit that serviced unhoused people.\n\n\"I just felt like I couldn't continue on,\" he adds.\n\nHis wife heard about Black Men Heal through a friend and suggested that he apply for a lottery they had to accept new patients. He and several of his friends wrote to the organization for free therapy and he heard back within days.\n\n\"When I came into Black Men Heal, it was like a breath of fresh air,\" Mr. Brown says. \"The therapist took me all the way back to problems with my dad, and problems with my hometown [Trenton, New Jersey], and just problems with me not believing in myself, all the way to the point where I am now. And it just freed me from a lot of those demons,\" Mr. Brown says.\n\nHis therapist gave him homework, having him write letters to people and address his trauma. He stopped therapy after his 12 free sessions because he said that he wanted to test to see if he was strong enough to incorporate what he'd learned into his daily life.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He secured a contract with the state of Pennsylvania to provide those services. His wife is pregnant again with their first child together. Once his new health insurance kicks in, he's going back to therapy, he says.\n\n\"Black Men Heal gave me a lot of confidence,\" he says, adding that his life \"changed for the better.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Academy showed up for their last-ever first day of school, they were surprised to see a familiar crowd waiting outside.\n\nAs they shuffled up to the front door, grinning in spite of themselves, each boy got a fist bump and words of encouragement from The Emerging 100 of Atlanta, a young professionals group for black men.\n\nThe E 100, as they're known, offer one-on-one mentoring at B.E.S.T. throughout the year, a program credited with pushing school graduation rates over 90 percent. The nationwide average for black men, in contrast, stands at just 59 percent , compared to 80% for their white classmates. The E 100 are themselves beneficiaries of the pass-it-on approach, mentored by 100 Black Men of Atlanta.\n\nAlthough the men have big dreams for their students, they hardly guessed that their power for good could extend beyond Atlanta. But as a quick video of their first-day greeting spread online, it turned into the gift that keeps on giving, inspiring similar events in Hartford, Connecticut, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, with the potential for more lasting change.\n\nWhen Connecticut Pastor A.J. Johnson heard about E 100's back-to-school surprise, he saw an opportunity to create role models for children without them. Too often, he believes, the media project a negative stereotype of black men: images and stories with tragic real-life consequences.\n\n\"The way the media portrays us is that we're thugs,\" Johnson explained to A Plus Media . \"I wanted to prove everyone wrong.\"\n\nDispelling these deeply-held biases starts early, so Pastor Johnson and DeVaughn Ward resolved to greet students at Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School with cheers, handshakes, and high-fives from as many men as possible: men, that is, dressed to the nines. Their \"Calling All Brothers\" social media campaign drew 100 volunteers, each one sporting his professional outfit, from business suits to police uniforms.\n\nMany of MLK's students are children of color, and single-parent households are common. For young boys, growing up black in a world where only 1% of Fortune 500 CEOs look like them, Johnson and DeVaughn believe that having a 100-strong cheering squad of professional black men sends a strong message to dispel dangerous stereotypes. Not just for children: \"For this image to get out of well-dressed men coming together, it's what the country needs at the moment,\" Johnson added.\n\nThe morning's extravaganza was such a blast, for kids and grown-ups alike, that the men headed off to another school once the elementary students had settled inside, and Ward hopes they can return to talk about their careers.\n\nBut Hartford was not the last stop for the now-contagious idea.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He also looks around at his own community and sees the unfulfilled promise of the years of President Obama, for whom he voted twice. Persistent wealth, income, and education gaps continue to devastate the black working class in America, he says.\n\nFor those reasons and more, he's now a supporter of Trump.\n\n\"I'd much rather have a guy look me in the eyes and tell me what he really feels than try to tell me what he thinks I want to hear,\" he says. \"That's a man whose hand I'll shake. And that's why I have no worries about Trump.\"\n\nBy the numbers, the 2016 election looked typical, in many ways. Exit polls show Trump won 8 percent of the black vote, continuing Republicans' largely dismal showing with that group. No Republican presidential candidate has won more than 15 percent of the black vote since Gerald Ford in 1976 (17 percent).\n\nBut in an election where racial rhetoric was so prominent and pointed - and where the first black president exhorted voters to choose Hillary Clinton - Trump's showing came as a surprise. Among black men, Trump won 13 percent.\n\nThe data don't point to a \"success\" for Trump in courting black voters, but they do point to important nuance. For some black working-class men, like Melendez, Trump's economic rhetoric resonated more than his racial rhetoric. In short, like their white working-class counterparts, they saw in Trump the man who would bring back their jobs and their dignity.\n\n\"What you are hearing is there are some minority voters who are not repelled by the racial undertones of Trump's message and are, in fact, ... attracted and intrigued by what they are hearing from Trump,\" says Andra Gillespie, an Emory University political scientist who studies black voting behavior. \"On top of all that, Trump portrays a patina of success, and because he looks successful people are willing to trust him to do things differently.\"\n\nMuch has been made about Trump's open appeals to white working-class men - a strategy that, particularly in the Rust Belt, likely won him the election.\n\nBut in some ways, a working-class platform can cross racial lines. The same decline in working class jobs that stoked the Trump rebellion has, if anything, hit the black working class even harder, Duke economist Patrick Bayer told the website Duke Today .\n\nIn addition, the black community faced steeply rising incarceration rates in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nProfessor Bayer's research, released in the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, found that 35 percent of black men weren't working in 2014 - up from 19 percent in 1960. That compares with 17 percent of white men in 2014 (and 8 percent in 1960).\n\nThat has exacerbated other gaps. \"When it comes to the earnings gap between black and white men, we've gone all the way back to 1950,\" Bayer added.\n\nTaken together with other research, \"these facts suggest ... black workers in those circumstances are more likely to fall into poverty, to be plunged into it more deeply, and to find it more difficult to recover in its aftermath,\" writes Georgetown University graduate student Gerald Taylor in \"Unmade in America,\" a report for the Alliance for American Manufacturing.\n\nIndeed, the dissatisfaction among the black working class is even deeper than it is among whites. Only 40 percent of the black working class are satisfied with their household finances, compared with 63 percent of the white working class, according to a September Kaiser Family Foundation/CNN poll . Meanwhile, 56 percent of African-Americans identify as working class, compared with 42 percent of whites, according to the General Social Survey .\n\nIn the small Georgia town where Euell Landrum grew up, jobs for young men were few and far between. So he ended up on the wrong side of the law for a burglary and, now in his 30s, is an Atlanta meat-cutter.\n\n\"Yeah, that definitely makes me working class,\" he chuckles.\n\nHe couldn't have voted for Trump given his felony conviction. But he says he would have voted for Trump, if he could have.\n\n\"We need help out here,\" he says, indicating the bustle of Dekalb County's Candler Avenue, a ramshackle collection of used tire shops, hair salons, and discount stores. As far as Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric, \"I think he'll change when he gets in there and realizes he's got a country to run,\" says Mr. Landrum.\n\nLandrum is certainly in the minority among black voters. If the exit poll numbers stand, Trump will have done worse among black voters overall than every other Republican presidential candidate in a non-Obama election since the Roper Center at Cornell University started keeping statistics in 1976.\n\nBut his better showing among black men shows that some part of his message resonated.\n\nFor Clarence Rogers, that appeal began with a memory.\n\nMr. Rogers had been on a career path at a corrugated cardboard factory. But foreign competition led to cutbacks, including his job. Since then, he's found jobs, \"but none that paid that well.\" Today, he runs a ramshackle Candler Avenue flea market in a strip mall.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump was criticized for what seemed to be monolithic views of the black community, often casting it as a violent inner-city slum. Mr. Rogers, however, didn't dismiss Trump's view.\n\n\"He's got a strange way of saying it, but a lot of it is true - we are struggling out here,\" he says.\n\nAnother part of Trump's appeal could simply have been in its unabashed masculinity.\n\nCertainly, it held little appeal for black women, who voted for Mrs. Clinton 94 to 4 percent.\n\nBut the growing black labor movement has been largely female-led and progressive, with black women heading the march to raise the minimum wage and equalize the justice system, says Keona Ervin, a history professor at the University of Missouri, Columbia, who looks at the role of black women in the struggle for economic equality.\n\nTrump's vision of the way forward in some ways has a more traditional feel. \"Part of it is that Trump recognized the inherent dignity of men and their need to provide for families, that that's part of their self-esteem and manhood,\" says Carol Swain, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University and author of \"Be the People: A Call to Reclaim America's Faith and Promise.\"\n\nThat has, at times, had a darker side, with Trump enjoying a kind of male camaraderie that explained away his comments about sexually assaulting women.\n\n\"Things that according to the media should have been devastating for Trump may easily have gained him a lot of votes among working class men, black and white, whereas black women take a dim view of that kind of behavior,\" says Orlando Patterson, a sociologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. \"Anyone who knows anything about working-class notions of masculinity - men black and white - should have known that that wasn't going to sink Trump.\"\n\nTo Professor Patterson, a Trump critic, the president-elect is speaking about issues that some in the black working class can understand.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

An education gap, criminal records, and racial bias all contribute to problems in the job market, experts say. What type of intervention would help?\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 26, 2011, 2:05 p.m. ET | Philadelphia\n\nThe jobs landscape is bleak for any unemployed American, but for black men it's virtually a desert.\n\nFor them, the Great Recession not only led to the largest increase in unemployment for any category of American worker, but it also is pinching a lot longer. About 1 in 6 black men over age 20 in the labor force is jobless - and that number has barely improved since the economic recovery officially began two years ago.\n\nIn Detroit , Las Vegas , Milwaukee , Min­neap­olis-St. Paul, and several other US cities, Depression-era unemployment rates above 20 percent beset the black community, estimates one economic policy group, citing government data. Moreover, the problem may get worse because city governments, which traditionally employ many African-American men, are laying off workers to cope with budget shortfalls, say experts on black employment.\n\nThe change has been dramatic. The jobless rate, 7.5 percent in prerecession days, is now 17 percent - more than double the rate for white men. The ramifications are dramatic: a slide out of the middle class; greater dependence on public assistance; new strain on families, including the challenge of meeting mortgage or child-support payments; and more homelessness.\n\nUS Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D) of Mis­souri, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , sees a long-term travesty for the whole nation if intervention is not redoubled to address the scourge of black unemployment. \"The failure of this nation to address this problem will lead to another 25 years of problems in this country based on race,\" he says in a phone interview. \"We ignore this crisis at our national peril - on the agenda are poverty, medical problems, crime, you name it.\"\n\nBlack men find it harder to land jobs for many reasons. Competition is fierce - in June, 4.7 unemployed job seekers for every opening - and a single blemish on a résumé can mean an employer will choose someone else. Among other hurdles for African-American men:\n\n•A disproportionate number have criminal records. Black men are incarcerated at more than six times the rate of white men and 2.6 times the rate of His­panic men, reports Human Rights Watch .\n\n•Fewer have college degrees, which are a big bonus in the job market. Among men, 17.9 percent of blacks over 25 have college degrees, compared with 34.2 percent of whites, according to the National Center for Education Statistics .\n\n•Semiskilled jobs and unskilled jobs, which are often filled by those without a college education, are on the decline.\n\n•Federal spending is likely to shrink, including funding for programs aimed at reducing black joblessness.\n\n•Racism persists in hiring and firing despite antidiscrimination laws, studies show.\n\nNate Robinson of Philadelphia lost his job to the recession - and he's been struggling ever since. He was selling cars at a General Motors dealership that closed in 2009 when the auto giant entered bankruptcy and went through a restructuring.\n\n\"When I got hired, the [dealership's] manager said, 'You are going to help put GM back on the map,' \" he recalls. \"After they went out of business, it was kind of hard to get back into it.\"\n\nWhile he looks for work - sometimes finding temp jobs - Mr. Robinson tries to survive on welfare. An inability to find permanent work led to personal problems and substance abuse, but for the past nine months he has been drug-free, he says.\n\nUnemployment has pushed him out of the middle class and into poverty: The welfare checks total $102.50 every two weeks. \"So I have no money in my pocket,\" he says. \"But I'm not complaining. I know God has something out there for me.\"\n\nRobinson now bemoans the fact that he never went to college.\n\nThe 'education gap'\n\nThe education gap is what stands out to John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C. It makes black men more vulnerable to job loss, he says. \"We know the unemployment rate for college graduates is 4.5 percent,\" says Mr. Silvia. \"A lot of black men do not have a college degree, and because of the changing nature of the workforce - oriented more toward education, finance, and IT [information technology] - they don't fit into the jobs that are available.\"\n\nThe disparity in college education between black men and other prospective hires has persisted for the past 10 years and is especially glaring in the sciences. \"African-Americans are incredibly underrepresented in these fields,\" says Betsey Stevenson , a Labor Department economist. Only 3 percent of black men work in professional, scientific, and technical services, where job growth is occurring, according to government figures.\n\nMath and science were never his strong suits, says Craig James of Philadelphia, who is looking for work. But he envisions himself going back to school, perhaps for computer courses, once he lands a job. He graduated from high school three years ago. The main impediment to continuing his education now is that he is a single parent of a young son.\n\n\"I know you've got to learn to use technology,\" says Mr. James, who was laid off last year from a job in the security industry because, he acknowledges, he \"messed up\" by not following all company rules and by arriving late to work. His last job was talking to students about the value of an education for the nonprofit group Mothers In Charge. The group scaled back when some of its funding from the Obama stimulus package ran out.\n\nNow, with 3-year-old Zakia to care for, James says he has become more responsible. \"My son made me stronger,\" says James, who lives with his parents and Zakia in North Philadelphia . He's looking for work but says he is frustrated that he has had no callbacks.\n\nCriminal records and discrimination\n\nBy the time they were 30, 22 percent of black men born between 1965 and 1969 had been incarcerated, compared with 3 percent of white men the same age, according to one study. And surveys show that a majority of employers are reluctant to hire someone with a criminal record.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) held a commission meeting to examine whether criminal background checks were adversely affecting the job prospects of workers of color. In 1990, the EEOC concluded that \"an employer may not base an employment decision on the conviction record of an applicant or employee absent business necessity.\" According to the National Employment Law Project that means employers must take into account reasonable factors such as the age and seriousness of the offense in relation to the specific job at issue\n\nOn a recent morning at a career center on New York 's Staten Island , Jamal Lump ­kin, who left prison in September after serving 10 years for drug-related crimes, recounts his job-seeking experience. He says several interviews went well - until the employer asked about criminal background.\n\n\"When we get out, nobody wants to give us an opportunity,\" says Mr. Lumpkin. He has started to feel desperate, he says.\n\nEmployers' perceptions about criminality among black men may even affect job prospects for African-American men who have never done time. One study found that black men without criminal ­records \"have as much difficulty [getting hired] as white males with a criminal record,\" says Algernon Austin of the Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy at the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington think tank. \"And black males with a criminal record are worse off than black males without one.\"\n\nDiscrimination remains an issue, too. When a Chicago fair employment group sent out \"matched pairs\" - that is, white and black people with the same credentials - whites were offered jobs 16 percent more often than African-Americans were, says Christine Owens of the NELP, which advocates on behalf of the jobless.\n\nMunicipal jobs, which many African-Americans see as a haven from racial bias, are in short supply these days. There are 430,000 fewer government jobs since the recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department's Ms. Stevenson.\n\n\"We have flocked to government by the throngs,\" says Congressman Cleaver, \"because it represented opportunity and a place where you are least likely to experience racial bigotry.\"\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThe Obama administration - which is, after all, led by an African-American man - is hardly oblivious to lingering racial bias in the workplace or soaring black male unemployment. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , in a phone interview, says she has beefed up her department's investigative division, which deals with workplace bias and other illegal practices. \"We have almost doubled and tripled investigations,\" says Ms. Solis, compared with 2008 levels.\n\nShe outlines some Labor Department efforts to help connect unemployed African-Americans with better jobs:\n\n•Job Corps, an education and training program for young people. Some 78 percent of people who complete the program land a job in fewer than nine months, Solis says.\n\n•A pilot program for military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It sets aside 300 slots for veterans at Job Corps centers in Indiana , Kentucky , and Missouri that serve large minority populations.\n\n•A partnership with the Department of Justice to provide job and mental-health counseling to federal and state inmates before they are released. \"Once [former convicts] get hired, companies find they are some of the most loyal employees,\" says Solis.\n\n•A push to give federal incentives to companies that scale back employees' hours rather than lay off workers. The administration backs such \"work share\" legislation, saying it preserves jobs and opens up more job opportunities, including those for black men.\n\nIn Congress, meanwhile, black lawmakers are \"moderately\" optimistic about a bill that would funnel US grant money to parts of the country that have seen 30 years of high poverty levels. US grantmaking agencies would target 20 percent of such funds to those areas, says Cleaver. Key Republicans with whom he has met have no objection to the legislation, he says. \"There are about 80 congressional districts where there are such areas,\" he says.\n\nStill, these days Congress is cutting more programs than it is adding. And it has yet to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act , which sends money to states, cities, and counties for job training and counseling.\n\nFrustrated by Washington's slow pace at addressing job creation, the Congressional Black Caucus plans to bring job fairs to five cities - Cleveland , Atlanta , Detroit, Miami , and Los Angeles - starting Aug. 8. It has lined up companies to attend and hopes to see 10,000 workers hired as a result. \"Realizing [that the US in June] only created 18,000 new jobs, this is a pretty big number,\" says Cleaver.\n\n• Patrick Wall in New York contributed to this report.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Here's what they had to say.\n\nApril 09, 2012, 10:08 a.m. ET\n\nAs he strides through Louisville 's Smoketown neighborhood, Will Jones fits the profile that seems to arouse suspicion among some Americans: skinny, young, black, male, earphones, hoodie.\n\nIt's a perception that Mr. Jones is aware of, though he considers himself \"pretty much the nicest guy you'll ever meet.\"\n\nThe hoodie, he says, is his most comfortable article of clothing, and it advertises Jones's interest in anime cartoons - but he also believes it played a role in the three occasions when \"white cops\" stopped him for no apparent reason, asking what he was up to.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Jones has not heard of the Trayvon Martin case. Told the basic outlines, he says George Zimmerman never should have gotten out of his SUV. But he also wonders what Trayvon's attitude was during the confrontation.\n\n\"I think a lot of it has to do with how people perceive themselves,\" says Jones. \"My rule,\" he adds, \"is to never throw the first punch and always try to talk my way out of situations.\"\n\nGrowing up, Jones lived in places ranging from Jackson, Miss. , to Columbus, Ohio . During his family's stints in Jackson and Atlanta , he says, his mother worried a lot about social attitudes toward young black men and whether his attire could get him into trouble. In grade school in Jackson, a white classmate once warned him off an interest he had in a white girl.\n\nOn the other hand, when Jones moved to Ohio and became the only black kid in his class, he dreaded prejudice that never materialized.\n\nThese days, he feels \"kind of in the middle\": shunned by some blacks as a \"sellout\" for his proper diction, and seen by some whites as \"just weird\" for the way he dresses. \"You get it from all sides,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's pretty lonely not to have either of those worlds to completely inhabit.\"\n\n- Patrik Jonsson, staff writer\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For Black men specifically, this couldn't be more true.\n\nBillionaire hip-hop mogul Jay-Z espouses the importance of therapy in a Netflix interview with former talk show host David Letterman. Charlamagne Tha God, a host of the nationally syndicated radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" is a strong proponent of mental health awareness and destigmatizing it in Black communities. He often shares his personal battles with anxiety.\n\nWhen comedian Marlon Wayans served as the guest host for Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" this spring, he implored guests and viewers to donate to a Philadelphia area nonprofit that specializes in introducing Black men to therapy.\n\nStigma and lack of affordability around mental health in vulnerable communities can hinder progress. A Philadelphia-area nonprofit seeks to help one segment of the population heal.\n\nBlack Men Heal is a 5-year-old organization that has been increasingly part of the conversation about Black men and mental health, specifically in a time of upheaval in America. The group, which also curates programming for people of color, is the brainchild of founder Tasnim Sulaiman, a licensed therapist who ran her own private practice before she started Black Men Heal.\n\n\"I had clients - Black men - who all started coming to me with some of the same problems, and I started to see a pattern,\" Ms. Sulaiman says.\n\nDuring her private sessions with clients, recurring problems kept manifesting: unresolved childhood trauma, absentee fathers missing from their lives, and frustration from having to traverse a larger world full of societal ills. She helped many of her clients resolve marital, professional, and personal problems. But she was only one person, and every Black man in Philadelphia didn't have the same income as the men who sat down across from her.\n\n\"I started to wonder how many other Black men were feeling like this but weren't going to therapy. My clients were well-to-do men who could afford to pay $150 [per visit] or they had jobs with good insurance,\" she says.\n\nA picture of how she envisioned Black Men Heal came to her one day while out jogging, and she got to work. She had already started doing pro bono work for some financially strapped individuals, but she saw that the number of Black men in need was much higher. Her goal was to offer multiple free sessions and pair the men with culturally sensitive therapists, perhaps Black men, who could build rapport with them and establish trust. She had a daughter to raise and bills of her own as a newly divorced woman, so she couldn't offer all of her services for free. But she could gather a community of like-minded people to address the issue, she thought.\n\n\"I knew other people who were therapists. I told them what I was trying to do but that I couldn't pay them,\" Ms. Sulaiman says. \"Since I like to cook, I told them that I could cook for them,\" she says during a Zoom call, pointing from her kitchen to the dining room table of her home.\n\nThey bought into her idea and started to offer pro bono therapy. Black men also bought into the idea. Today Black Men Heal offers eight free sessions to new participants and seeks to destigmatize therapy and eliminate costs. If participants wish to continue therapy, they can if their insurance covers it or if they can afford it out of pocket.\n\nBlack Men Heal has a 75% continuation rate among participants. It hosts virtual Sunday sessions called Kings Corner, where Black men from across the country gather on Zoom to talk about healing. In five years, Black Men Heal has served 3,567 men, between individual therapy and Kings Corner sessions, with 1,642 new individuals participating in 2022. Since starting in 2018, the organization has expanded its list of providers beyond Pennsylvania to Delaware, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, the District of Columbia, New York, Virginia, and Georgia.\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, Black Men Heal has inspired local organizations and has been recognized for its community work. Film director Muhammad Bilal credited his time in counseling through Black Men Heal with helping him work through personal issues. He went further and created a 48-minute film, \"Perdido,\" about mental health. He premiered the film and participated in a panel discussion about it, led by Ms. Sulaiman, at a Community Mental Health Awareness Day in West Philadelphia in early May.\n\nChapter leaders at African American Greek Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, Pi Gamma Sigma Alumni Chapter, wanted to shine a light on the work that Ms. Sulaiman was doing. They named Black Men Heal the nonprofit business of the year in 2019 at their Bigger and Better Business ceremony. They also are debuting a new initiative this year, My Brother's Keeper, where they want to send alumni fraternity members - no questions asked - to the organization for counseling for mental health wellness.\n\n\"As Black men, or men in general, we keep quiet about stuff when we shouldn't, and for her to tackle that, that was big. There's a lot going on in the world today,\" says William Streeter, who chaired the board that nominated Black Men Heal for the award. \"She's definitely making a difference and it's slowly growing, because we've been watching for a while. We figured we could help support her by sending a few people her way.\"\n\nParticipation in Black Men Heal grew tremendously during the pandemic. Ms. Sulaiman says the ability to offer counseling sessions virtually, which is how the sessions are done now, helped more men connect with the organization.\n\nLeBrian Brown was a pandemic convert to Black Men Heal, after a series of setbacks almost drove him to his breaking point. \"We had just lost a baby,\" he says. \"My wife got laid off from work. It was during COVID. I was just depressed, man.\"\n\nHe was crushed after seeing George Floyd's murder online and participated in multiple protests, he says. His family went from two incomes to surviving on the $40,000 he made working at a Philadelphia nonprofit that serviced unhoused people.\n\n\"I just felt like I couldn't continue on,\" he adds.\n\nHis wife heard about Black Men Heal through a friend and suggested that he apply for a lottery they had to accept new patients. He and several of his friends wrote to the organization for free therapy and he heard back within days.\n\n\"When I came into Black Men Heal, it was like a breath of fresh air,\" Mr. Brown says. \"The therapist took me all the way back to problems with my dad, and problems with my hometown [Trenton, New Jersey], and just problems with me not believing in myself, all the way to the point where I am now. And it just freed me from a lot of those demons,\" Mr. Brown says.\n\nHis therapist gave him homework, having him write letters to people and address his trauma. He stopped therapy after his 12 free sessions because he said that he wanted to test to see if he was strong enough to incorporate what he'd learned into his daily life.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Meet Noah Harris, the first Black man elected student body president in Harvard's 384-year history\n\nRelated Stories\n\nNoah Harris was in the middle of a basketball game for Oak Grove High School in Hattiesburg, Mississippi when Harvard sent him his acceptance email on December 12, 2017.\n\n\"I knew I wouldn't be able to know if I had been accepted until after the game was over, which was agonizing,\" he recalls. \"I played all right, but my mind was somewhere else - on the admissions - as you can imagine. We ended up winning.\"\n\nAfter the game, Harris and his parents raced home and crowded around a laptop in their kitchen and together read the word \"Congratulations.\"\n\n\"We were ecstatic,\" he says.\n\nThis year, the 20-year-old got the chance to celebrate again when he was elected Harvard's student body president, making him the first Black man to do so in the school's 384-year history.\n\nCNBC Make It spoke with Harris about his campaign, his professional ambitions and his advice to other students.\n\nHarris says his first year at Harvard came with some shocks. He had never lived in a city as large or as cold as Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nHaving served as the student body president of his high school, Harris decided to run for student government his first year on campus.\n\n\"The first-year elections are super competitive and normally deter people from running because there are four first-year 'yards' and each yard gets three spots, but everyone comes into Harvard, as you can imagine, being their high school student body president. Just being 'that' person,\" he says with a laugh. \"And so everyone runs.\"\n\nHe estimates that between 60 and 100 first-year students typically compete for 12 spots and says he felt lucky when he earned one, soon becoming the secretary of the finance committee.\n\nHarris says he \"fell in love\" with the finances of Harvard's student government, describing the details of a $1.5 million annual budget - nearly $500,000 of which is typically allotted by the finance committee.\n\n\"I had done student government before, but I'd never done student government where the government actually had a budget that was so significant,\" he says. \"[The finance committee] has roughly half a million dollars to be able to do projects and to make make your mark.\"\n\nIt was during this first year on Harvard's undergraduate student council that he met his future running mate, Jenny Gan.\n\nBy his junior year, Harris says \"I knew I wanted to run [for president] with Jenny Gan.\"\n\n\"We both wanted to use our campaign to move Harvard forward in a significant way,\" he says. \"But to do so in a year that is just so unprecedented was an interesting challenge for us because we knew that people were not engaged. We knew that people were struggling.\"\n\nThis school year has undoubtedly brought a unique set of challenges to students across the country . And in light of these challenges, Harris and Gan picked an ambitious platform and a progressive slogan: \"Building Tomorrow's Harvard.\"\n\nTheir platform took on several issues they knew were on the front of students' minds, the first being a diversity and inclusion plan designed to \"make sure that Harvard is standing behind its students of color during a time where you needed support.\"\n\nHarris and Gan proposed creating an advocacy fund, intended to give interested Harvard students as much as $300 to protest.\n\n\"Students are at the forefront of [social] movements,\" says Harris, who this summer attended Black Lives Matter protests and helped raise $300,000 for Black advocacy and civil rights organizations. \"And so we want to give them the cost of food, travel, other supplies to voice their opinions publicly\"\n\nThe pair's platform also included policies aimed at improving the lives of students during the pandemic, including renting a local warehouse so students can cheaply store their belongings as well as bolstering mental health resources.\n\nBut communicating this platform came with its challenges, especially as Covid interrupted the on-campus experience .\n\n\"Campaigning virtually was very difficult because in a normal year, I'm used to going up and meeting people, knocking on doors, passing out fliers and getting a pulse on the ground for how the campaign is going,\" admits Harris, \"It was just very hard to read the climate in that way because everything was in such a vacuum - it was taking place on social media, in group chats, in club email lists.\"\n\nWhat's more, many Harvard students could not vote in the election because they had chosen to take time away from school.\n\nThe pandemic also impacted how the election results were announced.\n\n\"Normally, every campaign has a gathering with all their supporters and campaign staff. But of course, we weren't able to have that because of the virus. And normally, you get a call from the election commission - that's tradition - and the election commission will call every ticket involved and they will tell them the results good or bad. That call normally comes around 11 o'clock at night,\" says Harris. \"But we got a call at about 5:30 p.m. and so we were very nervous.\"\n\nTo their surprise, Harris and Gan had won, and Harris became the first Black man elected to serve as Harvard's undergraduate student body president.\n\n\"We were so grateful and soon after that, realizing that we had made history made that moment even more profound as well. It wasn't something that we went around telling people, like, 'Hey if you vote for us, you'll be electing me first Black man student body president!'\" Harris says, \"But making history was special, especially in this year of all these racial injustices and police brutality and people being taken from our communities way too soon. For the Harvard student body to elect its first Black man in that way was just so special and something that I'm honored to be a part of.\"\n\nHe continues, \"I hope the message is that Black men, and young African Americans in general, belong at these universities. That they can be from Mississippi. And to not be deterred from applying to [schools like] Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford. That they can belong in these spaces. And not only can they belong, but they can thrive.\"\n\nAfter earning his Bachelor's, Harris says he wants to go to law school and become a courtroom attorney, though he seems to have a natural ability for, and sincere interest in, politics.\n\nWhen asked where he would like to study law, he quickly and politically responds:\n\n\"My dream law school would be Harvard.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But I'm definitely open to a number of other places as well.\"\n\nDon't miss:\n\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\n\n© 2025 CNBC LLC.

      "text": "P&G's latest ad takes on racial bias against black men in America\n\nProcter & Gamble wants to get people thinking about racial bias with a spot called \"The Look,\" which follows a black man and the way the world sees him.\n\n\"The Look\" was released Thursday on a P&G site , along with educational materials, historical examples and (eventually) resources to \"educate and continue the conversation on how unconscious bias plays a role in society today.\" The spot was previewed last week at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity and at a BET Networks conference called Meta .\n\nThe latest ad shows a black man going through his day, with people seeming to willingly shut an elevator before he approaches or watching him suspiciously while he browses in a store. At the end, he's revealed at the helm of a courtroom as a judge. It concludes with the words, \"Let's talk about the look so we can see beyond it.\"\n\nThe consumer packaged goods giant has touched on this topic before. An earlier video called \"The Talk\" depicts conversations black parents have with their children to prepare them for racial bias they may face. That ad won an outstanding commercial Emmy award. And earlier this month, the company's \"My Black is Beautiful\" campaign asked dictionaries to rethink their definitions of the word \"black,\" saying dictionaries too often prioritize terms such as \"evil\" or \"dirty\" over those that describe the word as it relates to identity and skin color.\n\nP&G knows consumers these days are wary of advertising, so the company says it's exploring different creative partnerships to expand \"what advertising could be.\" This particular spot was created with a \"creative collective\" called Saturday Morning, which seeks to change perceptions on racial bias and injustice.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "website": "https://www.cnbc.com",
      "text": "Racial health disparities already existed in America- the coronavirus just exacerbated them\n\nRelated Stories\n\nIn April, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States' leading expert on infectious diseases, spoke in a press conference about the impact Covid-19 is having on communities of color, particularly African Americans.\n\n\"When all this is over - and as we've said, it will end - we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community,\" he said in an April 7 press briefing.\n\nThose \"disparities\" Fauci mentioned are linked to early numbers that show African Americans are disproportionately dying from Covid-19. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state's population, but account for 41% of coronavirus deaths, according to data released by Michigan's government . In Illinois, black people make up 14% of the population, but account for 32.5% of coronavirus deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health .\n\nIn Louisiana, where black people make up about 33% of the population, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in early April they account for more than 70% of the state's coronavirus deaths, with the majority of these fatalities taking place in New Orleans. And in New York City, black and Latino people are twice as likely to die from the virus than their white peers, according to data by the local government. All of these figures are based on the most recent data released to the public, with more states and local governments being pressured to share a racial breakdown of their numbers.\n\n\"There are definitely multiple reasons why we're seeing black communities be disproportionately impacted by Covid-19,\" New York-based physician Dr. Uche Blackstock tells CNBC Make It . She explains that when you look at the \"social determinants of health,\" such as where a person lives, works and the quality of health care they have access to, you will see that structural racism has left African Americans \"vulnerable and marginalized.\"\n\n\"Even before this [pandemic], we had significant health inequities,\" she adds, while emphasizing the increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension, asthma and obesity in the black community. \"And what we're finding out is that these are the underlying medical conditions that result in very serious complications from Covid-19.\"\n\nCNBC Make It spoke with Blackstock, along with five other black doctors, nurses and experts, to get their thoughts on how housing location, health-care access and distrust in the medical system have all contributed to the racial health disparities we see today.\n\nDue to a history of housing discrimination and redlining, which is the systemic practice of refusing government resources to predominantly black neighborhoods because they've been deemed a financial risk, generations of African Americans have been forced to live in areas that lack access to healthy food options. Many of these neighborhoods, which researchers have categorized as \" food deserts \" are filled with fast food restaurants and small corner stores that have more junk food options than fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"I think it's really important to understand that dietary choices aren't moral choices,\" says Dr. Chinara Tate, director of nutrition at Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Center of Excellence in New York. She explains that for many black and brown people living in poor communities, the food choices they make are made through a survival mindset, and they don't have the luxury of thinking about the long-term impact of their diet. \"If you have the option of purchasing an onion for a dollar or purchasing a meal for a dollar, it makes the most sense to purchase the meal, even if it's not the healthiest option because an onion is not going to feed your family.\"\n\nAs a result, residents in these communities tend to rely on high calorie foods that are cheaper and more accessible, says Dr. Jessie Marshall, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. \"And we know that results in chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity,\" she says. \"So again, Covid-19 did not create these racial disparities that we are seeing. It simply magnified these disparities in unbelievable ways.\"\n\nIn 2017, 55.5% of African Americans had private health insurance, compared to 75.4% of white Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . That same year, 43.9% of African Americans relied on Medicaid or public health insurance and 9.9% were uninsured altogether.\n\nThis disparity in health care is linked to the employment of African Americans who, along with Latinos and Hispanics, are overly represented in low-income roles that often lack insurance and benefits for hourly workers. Today, 63% of Latino or Hispanic workers and 54% of black workers earn low wages, compared to 40% of Asian American workers and 37% of white workers, according to a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution , which found that even in these low-wage roles, black and Hispanic workers earn less than white workers with the same education level and experience.\n\nLow wages, according to the study, are categorized as jobs that pay a median salary of $10.22 per hour or $17,950 per year. Some of these roles include grocery store clerks, home health aides, fast food workers and other service sector jobs that have been deemed \"essential\" during the coronavirus pandemic. Not only do these roles require workers to work outside the home, but many of them also offer no paid sick or family leave.\n\n\"Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,\" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, she says black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost.\n\n\"I've seen my own family go through the fact that when you don't have health insurance you basically avoid the doctor until it's like a life-or-death scenario,\" says Archibong. For many essential black and brown workers, she says it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.\n\nFor black Americans who do have access to health insurance, going to the doctor is not always a smooth process as there has been a long-standing distrust between black patients and medical professionals. This distrust, according to many experts, is linked to the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment in 1932 where the U.S. Public Health Service used black men to conduct a secret study on the progression of the deadly syphilis disease in order to find a treatment.\n\nThe study initially involved 600 black men, 399 of whom had syphilis and 201 who did not, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The men were not told the purpose of the study and were instead told that they were being treated for \"bad blood.\" The study, which was supposed to run six months, ended up lasting for 40 years, with the men unknowingly being used as test subjects. In order to track the progression of the disease, researchers and doctors did not provide any treatment to the men for their illnesses, even though a cure for syphilis was found in 1947. As a result, many of the participants died, went blind or experienced other severe health problems. In some cases, wives of the participants also became infected and their kids were born with congenital syphilis.\n\nBeyond the Tuskegee experiment, black Americans have also lacked trust in the healthcare system after years of feeling unheard by medical professionals, says Dr. Utibe Essien, a health disparities researcher and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He points to modern-day research that shows that even when black patients voice concerns about their health, they are sometimes ignored or treated differently than their white counterparts.\n\nAnother way this plays out, he says, is seen in the black maternal health crisis . Black women have the highest maternal mortality rate of any racial group in the U.S., dying 2 1/2 times more often than white women during childbirth. This disparity, he says, became an even bigger headline when high-profile celebrities like Serena Williams and Beyonce opened up about their highly complicated child births. \"These are experiences that whether you're a poor African American or rich African American, known or not known, are unfortunately being had by many of us.\"\n\nRecognizing a history of implicit bias in health care, the CDC recently advised medical professionals to \"identify and address implicit bias that could hinder patient-provider interactions and communications\" during the pandemic.\n\nDr. Earl Campbell, who is treating Covid-19 patients at Yale New Haven hospital, says one way to improve the level of trust between black patients and medical professionals is to diversify the medical workforce. Currently, just 5% of physicians in the U.S. are black. Campbell, who makes up part of that small workforce, is the first African American advanced endoscopy fellow at Yale.\n\nBlackstock agrees with Campbell about workforce diversity and started the organization Advancing Health Equity in 2019 to address the many disparities we see today around patient treatment, care, implicit bias and workforce numbers.\n\nHer hope, she says, is that once this pandemic is over, more attention will be paid at the policy level where \"government officials really think about how we can prevent this from happening in the future.\" This includes, she says, \"addressing social determinants of health\" that have long impacted the black community.\n\nVideo by: Alysha Webb\n\nDon't miss: Shut out of PPP loans, struggling with no child care: How Covid-19 is impacting women-owned small businesses\n\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\n\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\n\n© 2025 CNBC LLC.

But that number varies dramatically based on race and gender.\n\nThe wage gap is real: At every age, American men bring in more than their female counterparts.\n\nHere's the median income men earn in every age group, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the second quarter of 2019.\n\nFor comparison, here's the median income American women earn at every age, according to BLS data.\n\nMen hit their peak-earning age 11 years later than women, at 55 versus 44, a recent PayScale report found . Men also start at an advantage: At 22, they earn a median salary of $53,500, while women only take home a median of $40,400 per year.\n\nAt their respective peaks, women earn a median of $66,700 and men earn $101,200, PayScale reports. That's a difference of $34,500.\n\nNot all men make the same amount of money, however. White men tend to earn significantly more over time than men of color, resulting in a racial wage gap. The PayScale study found that black men reach their peak earning at age 59 with a median salary of $80,000, while white men hit their peak four years earlier making $104,100.\n\n\"This is likely in part due to men of color being less likely to move up the corporate ladder than white men,\" PayScale reports. \"It also may reflect the greater degree of wage discrimination that older men of color faced earlier in their careers.\"\n\nThere are just three black men leading Fortune 500 companies , and PayScale reported in May that black men are the only minority group to see the racial wage gap widens as they ascend the corporate ladder.\n\nLike this story?

Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign co-chair, in a statement. \"An economy where people don't just get by, but get ahead. Where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"\n\nHarris' announcement is aimed at increasing her support among Black male voters, and comes in the final weeks of an extremely close race between the Democratic vice president and Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe plan outlined Monday would provide 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. The loans would be financed through partnerships between \"mission-driven lenders,\" community oriented banks and the Small Business Administration, the campaign said.\n\nThe agenda also includes training and mentorship programs to help Black men get jobs in high-demand industries, and greater investments in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to recruit and retain Black male teachers.\n\nThe PSLF program provides student loan forgiveness after 10 years to borrowers who work in certain nonprofit and government jobs. Black men make up less than 2% of public school teachers in the U.S., according to the findings of the National Teacher and Principal Survey for the 2020-21 school year.\n\nA victory in November would make Harris the first Black woman and the first South Asian person ever elected president of the United States.\n\nHarris also promised she would support federal-level marijuana legalization, a major step beyond the Biden administration's current stance on cannabis, which includes pardoning people convicted of marijuana possession and exploring a potential reclassification of marijuana on the drug schedule.\n\nHarris \"will break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back by legalizing marijuana nationally, working with Congress to ensure that the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana is the law of the land,\" according to a Harris campaign statement.\n\n\"She will also fight to ensure that as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men - who have, for years, been over policed for marijuana use - are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market,\" the campaign said.\n\nHarris' new plan also contains a few lines about digital assets, another area where she appears poised to break ranks with the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to her campaign, Harris \"knows that more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, which is why her plans will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"\n\nIt was not clear Monday what that framework would look like, but a fierce battle over cryptocurrency regulation is well underway in Washington.\n\nAlthough polls show that Black voters overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump, by the end of the 2020 race, President Joe Biden had garnered a higher share of the key Democratic constituency than Harris is currently picking up three weeks out from Election Day, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll .\n\nPollsters in the field in late September and early October found that roughly 15% of Black likely voters said they planned to vote for Trump in November. This is 6 percentage points higher than Biden's final margin with Black voters in the 2020 race. The figures effectively quantify the ground that Harris hopes to make up in the coming weeks.\n\nWith her new proposals aimed at gaining Black men's support, Harris also hopes to draw a stark contrast with Trump.\n\nThe vice president regularly ties Trump to the Project 2025 agenda, a collection of hard-line policy plans developed by a conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, in conjunction with more than 100 other right-leaning organizations.\n\nTrump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, which proposes slashing funding for education and safety net programs such as Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Black business leaders make a final push for Harris' economic plans to Black men\n\nWhen you order a cheesesteak from Jim's West in Philadelphia these days, you get something else for free from owner Cortez Johnson: an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\n\n\"I support her for many reasons. She's definitely for the community. She's definitely for small business,\" Johnson recently told CNBC.\n\nSigns supporting Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, hang inside the restaurant in a predominantly Black neighborhood in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe vice president visited Jim's West in May to have a cheesesteak and talk about Black businesses. Since then, Johnson has been a vocal supporter.\n\n\"She's definitely foot on land, especially in Philadelphia,\" said Johnson. \"I'm looking at a willingness to help us thrive and build up small businesses.\"\n\nJohnson and other Black male voters have been a key target demographic for the Harris campaign since its somewhat unconventional start in July, when President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign.\n\nIt's also a group whose political allegiances have shifted in recent years. In 2020, only 12% of Black men voted for former President Donald Trump. This cycle, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has made inroads, although polls vary widely on precisely how much.\n\nHarris in September emphasized the need to win the confidence of Black male voters during a conversation with the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\n\"I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that Black men are in anybody's pocket,\" Harris said. \"Black men are like any other voting group. You've got to earn their vote. So, I'm working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.\"\n\nOthers are also working to help Harris earn those votes, right up to the final week of the election. On Monday, more than 5,000 attendees joined a video call organized by the Black Economic Alliance, a coalition of business leaders and advocates focused on economic development in the Black community.\n\n\"We are hosting this because Black men can decide this election,\" BEA co-Chair Tony Coles said on the call. \"There are decisive margins of us, of Black men in every battleground state ... it is literally in our hands.\"\n\nA poll conducted by the BEA found that Black male voters were most interested in hearing from Black business leaders about the election and about economic issues.\n\nSpeakers and attendees supporting Harris on the call included BEA co-Chair Charles Phillips, who is the co-founder and managing partner of Recognize; former American Express CEO Ken Chenault, former Merck CEO Ken Frazier, chairman of Essence Ventures Richelieu Dennis, CEO of US Black Chambers Ron Busby, and Gathering Spot CEO Ryan Wilson.\n\n\"We have got to make sure we have institutions that are here fighting on behalf of our business owners, our communities, as well as our families,\" Busby said on the call.\n\nSeveral speakers highlighted Harris' policy proposals focused on economic issues in the Black community, which was posted on the campaign website in October under the headline \"Harris will deliver for Black men.\"\n\nProposals include backing 1 million forgivable loans up to $20,000, a National Health Equity Initiative for Black men, and down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.\n\n\"Now there is the opportunity for her to lead, for her to drive these things herself, and I think you are going to see some incredible outcomes,\" Dennis said on the call.\n\nRecent polling by the NAACP shows Harris has gained ground with Black men under 50 in the past month: In October, 59% said they were likely to vote for Harris, up from 51% in the same poll in August.\n\n\"The other good thing that she has done is just acknowledge that Black men's votes matter,\" said Phillips, who is also a surrogate for the Harris campaign. \"No one has ever asked for their vote before. Just that lack of acknowledgment was an issue generally\" for the Democratic Party.\n\nBlack men and business leaders are also a key demographic for Trump, said Trump campaign spokesperson Janiyah Thomas.\n\n\"Team Trump's outreach to Black male voters and the Black business community is grounded in real, face-to-face engagement,\" Thomas told CNBC. \"We're hosting listening sessions and connecting directly with Black men, who are leaders in their families and communities, to understand their needs and deliver lasting solutions.\"\n\nHowever, speakers on the BEA call questioned the notion that Trump is committed to Black voters and businesses.\n\n\"You can rock with [Harris] and get probably about 90% of what you want, or go with [Trump] and get nothing,\" the Rev. Michael Blake, founder of the Kairos Democracy Project, said on the call.\n\nWilson, the Gathering Spot CEO, told CNBC he's focused on educating Black voters on Trump's economic policies, including tariffs that he believes would be detrimental to Black businesses.\n\n\"It is important for business leaders to engage, because the former president is putting forward some pretty dangerous policy proposals,\" Wilson told CNBC. \"Look at the opinions of economists, which are saying his policies would be inflationary and would add to the debt.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Unemployment spiked for Black men in January as more joined the labor force\n\nUnemployment among Black men surged in January as the number of those looking for work increased, according to data released Friday by the Department of Labor .\n\nIn January, Black workers saw their jobless rate edge higher to 6.2% from 6.1% in the month prior. This trend bucked the overall unemployment rate for the country, which ticked down to 4.0% in January from 4.1% in December. Asian Americans were the only other demographic to see a rise in jobless rates to 3.7% from 3.5%.\n\nOn the other hand, unemployment for white and Hispanic workers followed the overall trend and fell in January from the prior month. For the former, it decreased to 3.5% from 3.6%. For the latter, it fell to 4.8% from 5.1%.\n\nBut Black men experienced the biggest month-to-month spike in unemployment, with their jobless rates surging to 6.9% from 5.6%. On the other hand, the unemployment rate held steady at 5.4% for Black women.\n\nWhile Hispanic men also saw their jobless rate hold steady at 4.0%, unemployment rates for their female counterparts dropped to 4.5% from 5.3%. The unemployment rate also fell for white men to 3.1% from 3.3% and marginally decreased to 3.3% from 3.4% for white women. The data breakdown by sex was not readily available for Asian Americans.\n\nWhile the spike in unemployment rate for Black male workers certainly looks alarming on the surface, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics made some changes to their population controls and survey tools in January that makes it hard to compare the data to previous months, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Gould also potentially attributed the surge to standard data volatility.\n\n\"I think you would need to see a few months of that elevation, and not just a blip in the data, to think that there was something sinister going on,\" she told CNBC. Still, \"obviously, just the simple fact that it's so much higher than other groups is a systemic problem in and of itself.\"\n\nGould added that part of the rise in unemployment rate for Black men could be due to the fact that more of the cohort joined the job market in January.\n\nLast month, the labor force participation rate - the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work - ticked higher to 62.6% from 62.5%.\n\nAmong black workers, the rate rose to 62.5% from 62.4%. The rate jumped to 69% from 68.2% for Black men, while slightly increasing to 62.5% from 62.4% for Black women.\n\n\"When the unemployment rate rises, but there's also an increase in participation, that can often mean that people are more optimistic or coming back in the labor market looking for jobs,\" Gould added.\n\nAmong white workers, the labor force participation rate rose to 62.3% from 62.2%. Within Asian workers, the participation increased to 64.7% from 64.3%, and slipped among Hispanic workers to 66.8% from 67.5%.\n\n- CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Why Increasing Black Men In Medicine Is Essential\n\nBy Marybeth Gasman\n\nBy Marybeth Gasman ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBlack male doctor providing care to an African American baby.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the National Medical Association (NMA) recently announced a joint effort to convene the Action Collaborative for Black Men in Medicine in an effort to address the lack of representation of African American men in medicine. This effort follows a 2015 AAMC report, Altering the Course: Black Males in Medicine , that brought attention to this national crisis, noting there were more Black men applying and matriculating to medical schools in 1978 than in 2014. Since 2014, there has been only a small increase in the enrollment of Black men in medical school, from 2.4% during 2014-2015 academic year to roughly 3% in 2021 - 2022. African American men account for a mere 3% of doctors .\n\nRecently, medical schools, as well as health and education organizations, have increased their efforts to address this important issue. Why is it important, you might ask? In addition to fostering equity and opportunity for African American men, research demonstrates that individuals are more likely to go to the doctor and to be honest with their doctor about their health concerns if their doctor is the same race, and to a lesser extent gender. According to a 2020 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by four researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, African American patients have a better experience when their doctor is the same race. Moreover, according to a 2022 Gallop poll, 53% of African Americans find it difficult to locate a same race doctor.\n\nHaving high quality and culturally sensitive access to health care is essential for African Americans personally, and is vital to the pursuit of equity as a nation. African Americans experience higher rates of hypertension, stroke, and heart disease and African American men \"have the lowest life expectancy of any demographic group, living on average 4.5 fewer years that white men.\" Several factors contribute to the health disparities faced by African Americans, but these disparities are exacerbated by the lack of African American doctors available in the United States.\n\nThe AAMC and the NMA recognize that there is a need to focus on systemic change and increased collaboration across the education pipeline to address persistent barriers that Black men face. Thus, the Action Collaborative is comprised of experts from myriad disciplines who have identified premedical, academic medicine, socio-cultural factors at the base of the problem. After two years of planning, the Action Collaborative is now moving into its next phase, which requires engaging a broader range of partners in K-12, higher education, academic medicine, professional organizations, community-based organizations, and other key stakeholders to work together to refine a national action agenda, and plan for the implementation and evaluation of system-wide solutions.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the Action Collaborative held a Strategy Summit during which they crafted a plan for the next 3 years. Summit participants included representatives from K-12 education, foundations, healthcare companies, national science and health professional organizations, federal government agencies, current medical school students, and medical school faculty and administrators.\n\nDuring the Summit, participants identified factors across three areas that influence the pipeline and trajectory of Black boys and men interested in medicine - premedical, academic medicine, and socio-cultural factors. According to leaders at the Action Collaborative, \"Pre-medical factors include the quality of public education, funding, advising, and access to support systems. Factors related to academic medicine include pathway programs, recruitment, admissions and leadership accountability for diversity. All of these factors are embedded in institutional and societal structures and socio-cultural environments that have been shaped by systemic racism, negative narratives of Black men, and institutional cultures and climates that are not inclusive of Black men.\"\n\nAs a follow up to the Summit, the Action Collaborative will: engage in listening sessions with stakeholders to obtain feedback on the action agenda; onboard more individuals, organizations and institutions that will join the AC coalition and serve as collaborators to develop, invest in and implement an action agenda; and implement and monitor progress of the action agenda. The hope, according to the Action Collaborative partners, is that a systemic approach to the problem will lead to system-wide, long-lasting change in representation, and in the experiences of African American doctors, while also bringing equity and culturally relevant care to the Black population overall."

      "text": "Black Men In Business Say This Is The Key To Success\n\nBy Maya Richard-Craven\n\nBy Maya Richard-Craven , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about Black and neurodivergent identity in the workplace.\n\nBy Maya Richard-Craven ,\n\nContributor.\n\nA Black male executive smiles during a meeting.\n\nBeing a Black entrepreneur is far from easy. If you are a Black business owner who is struggling, know that there are so many Black entrepreneurs who are exhausted from running a business with little to no assistance. And in 2021, Black and African-American owned businesses only accounted for about 3% of businesses in the United States.\n\nIt's important to note that there are over 33 million small business owners in The United States alone. More than 80% of small businesses operate without any staff. But despite the odds, many Black men are overcoming adversity and thriving in entrepreneurship.\n\nFor example, Eszylfie Taylor , who is the president of Taylor Insurance and Financial Services, works with high profile families, executives, actors, athletes, and more. Taylor has extensive experience in both financial services and entrepreneurship. He even has a reality series and app called Mind.Body.Money , where he helps celebrity clients achieve financial freedom. He believes that it can be incredibly challenging to be an entrepreneur, especially a Black entrepreneur, in this economy.\n\n\"The most difficult part of being an entrepreneur in this economy is access to capital and people who can afford your services. The gap between the haves, and the have nots continues to widen, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult,\" he told me. \"Find those with not only the need but the discretionary income to utilize your products and services,\" he said.\n\nPlus, accessing capital can be even more difficult for Black entrepreneurs because (on average) African-American people have less exposure to financial literacy and have less intergenerational wealth than white Americans.\n\nThings may be tough for Black business owners , but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for Black entrepreneurs to overcome adversity and thrive. From building relationships to tapping into underserved markets, there are plenty of ways for Black business owners to increase revenue while making an impact. I spoke with a few Black male entrepreneurs who have extensive experience in the business world. Here's what they believe African-American business owners can do to be even more successful.\n\nDeveloping strong relationships is one of the most important parts of being an entrepreneur. And Taylor couldn't agree more. He believes that building relationships is the foundation of being a successful entrepreneur.\n\n\"Building relationships is of utmost importance. It is the life blood of business. If people do not know, like, or trust you, they are not doing business with you. Most products and services or commodities- you can get them from any number of people anywhere. It's the relationships in my business,\" he told me.\n\n\"I take measures to strengthen relationships. Price is generally no issue, of no consequence, whenever a relationship is present and you're supporting your friend, colleagues, and confidants,\" Taylor said. He is one of many entrepreneurs who I've spoken to who has found success due to building strong and authentic relationships.\n\nAnd Taylor doesn't just have relationships with other Black entrepreneurs. He has worked with people from a variety of backgrounds. Regardless of what someone looks like or where they are from, the financial guru is on a mission- to help all of his clients achieve financial freedom. It's important to note that he is one of many Black entrepreneurs who has absolutely crushed it in their career.\n\nGreg Maurice is also a major player in the business world. Like Taylor, he has become a big name in both business and entertainment. He is first-generation Haitian-American and is a globally respected executive and entrepreneur. He has acquired and licensed over three hundred films and $100 million in revenue for entertainment platforms like Amazon Prime, Apple TV, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, and Showtime.\n\nMaurice is currently the head of acquisition and Black cinema for Filmhub. He was previously the director of global acquisitions & co-productions for Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment's Black content division. He also founded Zaka Connect , a B2B and B2C career coaching and development platform for first and second generation immigrant professionals. He has great advice about how to become an even more successful entrepreneur.\n\n\"By leveraging data, entrepreneurs can identify gaps in the market where certain groups or needs are underserved. This data-driven approach allows for targeted efforts that not only open new revenue streams but also contribute to social impact by bringing services and products to those who need them most,\" he told me.\n\n\"Entrepreneurs who understand their market at this level can differentiate themselves by offering solutions that matter to overlooked communities. I heavily relied on data to identify services and tools for immigrant professionals and international students, a large group that is often misunderstood or forgotten,\" he said.\n\nMaurice stressed the importance of investing in compelling brand storytelling. Unlike some people in the corporate sector, Maurice believes that connecting emotionally with your audience is a vital part of becoming successful.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, your brand is very important, you have to connect emotionally with your audience. That's one of the only reasons that we invite immigrant professional leaders to share their career journey on our podcast. You get to relate to them. You learn the ups and downs and how they overcome challenges. For entrepreneurs, investing in a compelling brand story is crucial,\" he told me.\n\n\"A well-crafted narrative not only sets a business apart but also creates a lasting emotional connection with customers. It communicates the brand's values, mission, and the impact it aims to make in the world. This ongoing investment in storytelling ensures that the brand remains relevant, resonates with its audience, and fosters a deeper level of engagement,\" he said.\n\nRemember that these two men are just a few examples of Black men who are thriving in the business sector. Black people, especially Black men, have historically faced disadvantages across professions because of social issues like racism, lack of financial literacy, mass incarceration, and so much more. Despite all of this, Black male entrepreneurs are changing the face of business- and they're just getting started."

      "text": "Black Men Are Being Cropped Out Of The Employment Wave\n\nBy Kori Hale\n\nBy Kori Hale ,\n\nContributor.\n\nSerious employer reading resumes of candidates for vacancy\n\nThe labor market is recovering from the pandemic with the overall U.S. unemployment rate falling to 3.6% in March. However, it remained stagnant for women and Black Americans at 3.3% and 6.2% respectively. Specifically, Black men continue to experience persistent unemployment gaps and reduced economic opportunity, especially the older and disabled part of this demographic, with men aged 25-54 participating in the labor force at a rate of 6.5% . Is this economic recovery revealing the impacts of continuing systemic racism in the labor market?\n\nThe Breakdown You Need To Know:\n\nA decline can seem to indicate progress, but for Black people, the percentage was too high to begin with, CultureBanx reported. Black men's unemployment soared to a high of 16% in June 2020, by February 2022, their unemployment hovered at more than twice that of white men, at 6.4%. The Black unemployment rate has fallen, but the division in economic recovery is glaring. Vulnerable industries like retail, leisure and entertainment have an overrepresentation of young people, women and minorities who have seen larger declines in unemployment compared to other groups.\n\nWorkers across all racial groups have experienced larger declines in their unemployment rate compared with the recovery after the Great Recession in 2008. Minority laborers represent a significantly larger percentage of vulnerable employees, especially in cities like New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago, where there are more than 500,000 vulnerable workers who make up nearly half of that group.\n\nUnemployment Sunken Place :\n\nFrom April 2020 to June 2020, only 13% of jobless Black workers received expanded unemployment benefits under the CARES Act . It's plausible that there are far more Black men who are jobless than the already high unemployment figures would suggest, further contributing to greater poverty, reduced financial stability, and a lack of generational wealth in Black families and communities.\n\nIf Black men experienced the same unemployment rate as white men, on average, 406,270 additional Black men would have been employed each month in 2021, according to American Progress. An economy where Black men consistently experience significantly higher unemployment rates than white men cannot be considered as having reached full employment.\n\nSituational Awareness:\n\nRelatively high under-employment and unemployment over the past decade has meant that many Black households were unable to fully participate in the economic recovery currently taking place. In 2020, Black men earned just 75 cents for every $1 earned by white, non-Hispanic men.This means that the economic recovery is actually perpetuating systemic racism at the cost of continuing to widen the racial wealth gap."

He was fascinated with the doctor's instruments and asked lots of questions typical of a curious child. Over the years, the African American doctor mentored Dotson, allowing him to shadow his daily routine and encouraging him to study hard so that he, too, could become a doctor.\n\nNot many young black men like Dotson, now in his fourth year of medical school, have a black man in a white coat to model the example of what they can become. But he and other black medical students and physicians volunteer their time to the organization Black Men in White Coats (BMWC), with the mission to increase the number of black men in the field of medicine by exposure, inspiration and mentoring.\n\n\"It's important for black men to see themselves as being more than a stereotype, more than someone who can only plays sports,\" said Dotson. \"We have the ability to achieve and accomplish anything that we want to in this world, and those of us already doing it need to be there to mentor others.\"\n\nIt Takes a Village\n\nDr. Dale Okorodudu launched Black Men in White Coats in response to a 2013 report from the ... More Association of American Medical Colleges that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping.\n\nBMWC was the vision of Dr. Dale Okorodudu, who launched the BMWC website six years ago after seeing a 2013 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) report that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping. While a 2017 AAMC report documented a 53 percent growth among black or African American female medical school graduates since 1986, male graduates had declined 39 percent. During the 2018-2019 academic year, the AAMC reported that medical school enrollment consisted of 7.1 percent black; however, less than half were men.\n\n\"To become a black man in a white coat, you must first see yourself capable of becoming one,\" Okorodudu said. To create that vision, he has networked and partnered with students, physicians and medical schools across the country to expose black youth to the medical field and to provide necessary, ongoing mentorship.\n\nOn the BMWC website, Okorodudu posts podcasts and short video documentaries from both medical students and physicians-all expressly intended to inspire black youth that they, too, can become doctors. He's written books for parents and children to further inspire and educate. He's also created DiverseMedicine.org to increase ethnic and socioeconomic diversity within the field of medicine via mentoring and outreach.\n\nMore than 1,800 youth and parents attended the Black Men in White Coats Summit, exposing youth to ... More careers in medicine.\n\nLast year during Black History Month, Okorodudu and his team organized the first-ever BMWC Youth Summit at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Cancer biologist, patient engagement specialist, cancer survivor\n\nBy Victoria Forster ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBlack men should start getting tested for prostate cancer in their 40s, according to new guidelines.\n\nBlack men should get an initial prostate cancer test between the ages of 40 and 45, according to new screening guidelines published by the Prostate Cancer Foundation .\n\nIn the U.S., Black men are at higher risk of being diagnosed with and dying from prostate cancer than men of other races. Data suggests that they are diagnosed with prostate cancer between three to nine years earlier than other men and are two times more likely to die from the disease than white men.\n\nGuidelines for all men currently suggest getting an initial test for prostate cancer between the ages of 50 and 55, but according to the new guidelines, Black men should consider getting a test when they are between 40 and 45 years old.\n\n\"We don't know what causes prostate cancer,\" said Dr. William Oh, chief medical officer at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. \"We know it is a disease of aging, we know that there are some environmental factors and we know that it tends to run in families. But, we don't currently know why Black men are higher-risk for being diagnosed with prostate cancer than other men,\" added Dr. Oh.\n\nThe guidelines were formed by an advisory board of physicians and patients and involved reviewing available evidence including trials and scientific studies to extract any relevant data on prostate cancer in Black men. This are not the first time it has been recommended that Black men get tested earlier, but as Dr. Oh explains, with other guidelines, this was often a footnote rather than the main aim of the work.\n\n\"We wanted to put these guidelines out there in a very clear and distinct way. So that the message was not lost in an asterisk and that it's basically as clear as possible for the population and the man and his family who are reading about these recommendations,\" said Dr. Oh.\n\nTesting typically involves looking for levels of Prostate Serum Antigen. Although the consensus is that the test has saved many lives by detecting cancers early and enabling treatment, there is also some controversy around screening men who don't have any symptoms of prostate cancer.\n\n\"The PSA test is clearly the single best way to identify prostate cancer early, but it does have flaws,\" said Dr. Oh.\n\nPSA testing can provide false-positive results, leading to invasive and costly testing for no reason. It also is unable to detect the difference between aggressive disease that may require urgent treatment and non-aggressive cancer, which may require no treatment at all or a \"watch and wait\" approach.\n\n\"There is a balancing act of identifying too many clinically insignificant cancers versus finding the ones that might be dangerous and even fatal if you find them too late,\" said Dr. Oh.\n\nIf implemented widely, the new guidelines could reduce deaths from prostate cancer in Black men by almost a third, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation."

He was fascinated with the doctor's instruments and asked lots of questions typical of a curious child. Over the years, the African American doctor mentored Dotson, allowing him to shadow his daily routine and encouraging him to study hard so that he, too, could become a doctor.\n\nNot many young black men like Dotson, now in his fourth year of medical school, have a black man in a white coat to model the example of what they can become. But he and other black medical students and physicians volunteer their time to the organization Black Men in White Coats (BMWC), with the mission to increase the number of black men in the field of medicine by exposure, inspiration and mentoring.\n\n\"It's important for black men to see themselves as being more than a stereotype, more than someone who can only plays sports,\" said Dotson. \"We have the ability to achieve and accomplish anything that we want to in this world, and those of us already doing it need to be there to mentor others.\"\n\nIt Takes a Village\n\nDr. Dale Okorodudu launched Black Men in White Coats in response to a 2013 report from the ... More Association of American Medical Colleges that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping.\n\nBMWC was the vision of Dr. Dale Okorodudu, who launched the BMWC website six years ago after seeing a 2013 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) report that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping. While a 2017 AAMC report documented a 53 percent growth among black or African American female medical school graduates since 1986, male graduates had declined 39 percent. During the 2018-2019 academic year, the AAMC reported that medical school enrollment consisted of 7.1 percent black; however, less than half were men.\n\n\"To become a black man in a white coat, you must first see yourself capable of becoming one,\" Okorodudu said. To create that vision, he has networked and partnered with students, physicians and medical schools across the country to expose black youth to the medical field and to provide necessary, ongoing mentorship.\n\nOn the BMWC website, Okorodudu posts podcasts and short video documentaries from both medical students and physicians-all expressly intended to inspire black youth that they, too, can become doctors. He's written books for parents and children to further inspire and educate. He's also created DiverseMedicine.org to increase ethnic and socioeconomic diversity within the field of medicine via mentoring and outreach.\n\nMore than 1,800 youth and parents attended the Black Men in White Coats Summit, exposing youth to ... More careers in medicine.\n\nLast year during Black History Month, Okorodudu and his team organized the first-ever BMWC Youth Summit at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Drawing more than 1,800 attendees, the daylong program offered info sessions for elementary through high school students and their parents and introduced different medical specialties.\n\nAlways seeking ways to amplify his efforts, Okorodudu redesigned the event to make it more affordable and easily replicated across the country. BMWCx is a branded Ted Talk-style summit that can be independently organized by community leaders anywhere.\n\nOkrodudu's next goal is a documentary film that will tear down the false stereotypes of black men in America and demonstrate their potential.

More in human emotions facial expressions and depression concept. Isolated on grey blue background.\n\nMoney and mental health as stand-alone topics are riddled with taboos across the general public. For Black men, the relationship between the two is nuanced with a complexity that exists at the intersection of\n\nAlthough the same can be said for men and women of every background, the complex relationship between money and mental health for Black men is unique in that at one time Black men existed as a form of currency in the US via chattel slavery. In the uphill battle to be valued and recognized externally as men, while navigating feelings around self-worth that are often correlated with how much money one has, the mental and emotional significance of what money represents is magnified.\n\nThis is why financial trauma must be examined not only from the perspective of acute instances of financial stress or hardship experienced within one's lifetime but also as a sustained trauma traveling through the DNA and the psyche across generations.\n\nWhat you believe about money has a direct impact on financial outcomes. Looking at money as a prize to be won rather than a tool to be used results in a different kind of inflation than what you hear about in the news. This inflation speaks to the weight of money's intangible value or what money represents.\n\nHow success is commonly defined or pop culture's emphasis on hustle culture doesn't acknowledge historical or present day barriers to financial success that may result in feelings of worthlessness tied to a lack of money. Nor does it account for the hypervigilance that places the pursuit of money above things like physical and mental health, experiences, and even family.\n\nThese beliefs lend to behaviors with money or its acquisition that range in expression from:\n\nWhile the drivers of these behaviors might exist internally, their outward expression certainly ties into perceptions around status and social hierarchy as Black men attempt to either define what it means to be a man or preserve their idea of manhood.\n\nWith changing cultural norms on things like\n\ndiscussions around what it means to be a provider, salary expectations, and what kind of job he has have become the forefront of casual conversations related to worthiness when identifying a potential partner or spouse.\n\nWhile these conversations should certainly be had to determine financial compatibility, expectations don't always equal reality for men in the building stage, who have suffered some setback or are navigating an obstacle. Young men early in their careers might feel pressured to achieve a certain salary based on expectations articulated on social media or in casual dating scenarios about what makes them high value. This sometimes unrealistic pressure can result in feelings of inferiority and disappointment based on their current income which can lead to overworking and trigger financial trauma.\n\nSelf-worth tied to money is not a new cultural phenomenon, however. Black men learn from a young age through music and media that money equals access, freedom, and power. While this messaging isn't always positive in its delivery, it's easy to internalize through observations of who is rewarded and punished or what access and validation someone with money gets vs someone without.\n\nInternalizing messaging that places money on a pedestal highlights a lifestyle that does more harm than good in the long run but gives Black men the opportunity to experience a few moments of dignity and self-worth. Even if the tradeoff is increased stress, paranoia, loneliness, depression, and death, being able to experience what it feels like to not only be a man, but THE man as he is described in music and the media might seem worth it.\n\nMoney doesn't only equal self-worth for Black men, it equals safety. Money represents autonomy over self giving men the opportunity to not only choose their own path but to create it.\n\nEven during the time of slavery money influenced the family structure. Slave owners would break up families and sell them for profit. In some instances, slaves were able to buy their own freedom. In others freed men were able to purchase captive family members to keep them safe.\n\nMoney as a representation of safety exists today in a different form. Black men in some instances will adopt an entirely different persona at their places of employment in an act called codeswitching . This behavior typically results in the man being viewed through a nonthreatening lens rather than through the biased lens that perceives him as an angry Black man. While this may result in the desired outcome via career progression and longevity, it can take a toll on the mental health of the individual and their concepts of safety tied to salary and job security. That safety can also be tied to supporting the immediate or extended family in a concept known as the Black tax .\n\nThis creates an interesting paradigm as the earlier concept of self-worth might come into clash with the concept of safety in instances where the man needs to provide for himself and his family, but also navigates a toxic work environment. Feelings of confusion, frustration, and anger might surface one day boiling over in an outburst or breakdown.\n\nBlack men can begin to change their relationships with money by acknowledging that money is a tool, not a prize, and that their intrinsic value cannot be influenced by how much money they do or don't have. By building income generating skills and learning how to take that income and invest it in assets, Black men can focus on increasing their net worth rather than self-worth.\n\nBlack men can also build relationships to grow their network which will facilitate a diversity of thought around beliefs about money and subsequent money related behaviors. Seeing a financial therapist about any money related stress or anxiety can also help to establish practices to cope with financial stress and work through any negative feelings or beliefs that may linger relating to money."

      "text": "Black Masculinity And Mental Health: What Black Men Should Consider About Their Emotional And Mental Wellness\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nMen laughing.\n\nIt is well known that exposure to racism and discrimination are linked to various adverse mental health outcomes. The effects of systemic racism on Black Americans have been persistent and profound, and the increase in media reports and images of police brutality and violence inflicted upon members of the Black community have only added insult to injury. The impact can be chronic and traumatic events related to racism have been unrelenting for Blacks.\n\nAs mental health challenges continue to rise, some Black Americans are still not receiving the mental health care and treatment they may need. This is especially true for Black men, who are not only affected by the general barriers to medical treatment that many in the Black community face, but who also have internalized certain behaviors that fit within the social constructs of Black masculinity - ultimately impacting their help-seeking behaviors. Despite known or suspected mental health issues, Black men are for numerous reasons often reluctant to seek treatment.\n\nMental Health and the Black Community\n\nMental health issues are relatively common in the Black community at large. According to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities , African Americans are 20% more likely to experience serious psychological distress, such as major depressive disorder , than white Americans. Rates of major depressive disorder in young Black adults ages 18 to 25 increased by more than 3% between 2015 and 2018, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , yet Black Americans of all age groups are less likely to seek treatment than white Americans. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reports that Black adults are more likely than white adults to experience persistent symptoms of emotional distress, such as sadness, hopelessness, and feeling that they have to dedicate extra effort to everything they do.\n\nWhile numerous factors have historically contributed to the Black community's greater incidence of mental health challenges, more recently the ongoing exposure to discrimination and institutional racism alongside the pandemic has created what Brian Smedley, PhD , the chief of psychology in the public interest at the American Psychological Association, referred to in an interview with NBC News as a \"mental health tsunami\" that could be worsened by a dearth of resources to help.\n\n\"The combination of physical distancing, economic anxiety, and - for people of color - the very real stress from racism since the pandemic means that we will have a lot of unmet mental health needs unless we can dramatically shore up the mental health infrastructure and address workforce shortages,\" he said.\n\nScarcity of Resources and Mistrust Are Barriers to Care\n\nLack of access to culturally responsive and appropriate mental health care, along with documented racism and bias within the healthcare system, have made some people in the Black community less likely to seek treatment. According to research , there is a collective mistrust of healthcare and medical providers because of abuse Black patients have historically experienced under the guise of medical testing and advancement, such as in the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee .\n\nLack of access to services is another factor that prevents adequate mental health care, according to the NAMI : Resources can be difficult to obtain when people don't have health insurance, have demanding shift jobs, live in locations with few services, or don't have reliable transportation. Stigma and misinformation about mental illness can also deter people from seeking treatment.\n\nHow Black Masculinity Norms Affect the Mental Health of Black Men\n\nAdding to these factors for Black men specifically are traditional masculinity roles and ideas across racial and ethnic backgrounds that have caused men to struggle with being vulnerable and sharing their emotions - making them even more reluctant to seek help. A growing body of research and commentary looks specifically at how Black masculinity norms and presumptions affect mental health among Black men.\n\nIn her book We Real Cool: Black Men and Masculinity , the social and cultural critic bell hooks examined the impact on Black men of social expectations that they'll behave in ways associated with Black masculinity, and described how the expectation to follow a specific set of behaviors creates a toxic environment: Viewed inside a stereotype, Black men can become dehumanized and invisible, and their psychological and emotional health suffers. In addition, the lack of love and acceptance that many of them face can create a separate emotional crisis.\n\nResearchers who examine how Black masculinity and norms affect help-seeking behavior among Black men have found negative outcomes. In a study of Black men who were experiencing mental health challenges published in the July-September 2016 issue of Behavioral Medicine , notions about Black masculinity both exacerbated psychological and emotional challenges such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD and prevented the men from seeking help to address those challenges.\n\nTraditional media portrayals of Black men haven't helped. As a study published in 2019 in the journal Psychology of Men & Masculinities explains, we have been inundated with images in film, television, and social media that depict Black men as overly masculine and, in some cases, aggressive and hypersexual. Open displays of emotion, on the other hand, are often frowned upon and not socially acceptable, sending a clear message to some Black men that to be accepted, they must fit a particular gender role in which strength and stoicism are mandatory.\n\nBlack men experience unique challenges that other men don't face because of the attention placed on their looks and bodies - and rarely on their mental or emotional intelligence. Research suggests that in many spaces, Black men are expected to be strong and resilient physically. They are encouraged to do well in athletics and to engage and thrive in physical activities, but not in activities that promote learning or emotional or mental growth.\n\nThe foundation of this Black masculinity construct is laid early, with many Black men growing up believing their psychological and emotional health and wellness do not have an inherent or productive value to other members of the Black community or to society as a whole. Many Black men internalize the idea that their value lies in what they can contribute physically, such as through sports or performing physical labor, and that discussing or exploring psychological or emotional concerns is in direct contradiction to societal expectations.\n\nSelf-examination may be seen as not only pointless, but a sign of weakness. According to Neal-Barnett, in order for Black men to seek and receive help, they must be willing to be vulnerable enough to admit that they need help and ask for it. And asking for help requires some Black men to deviate from expectations that require them to be tough - which itself can create significant inner tension and conflict. Given the numerous negative impacts of Black masculinity, experts like Neal-Barnett wish the construct could be done away with entirely.\n\nMore Black Men Are Exposing Vulnerabilities, Creating Space for Dialogue and Change\n\nDespite these norms and the frequent inner struggle over vulnerability, more and more Black men are sharing their challenges with mental health. In 2016, the rapper Kid Cudi openly talked about his depression on social media, as reported by The Good Men Project , after which the hashtag #YouGoodMan quickly began to trend on Twitter to encourage Black men to share more about mental health issues.\n\nIn 2018, the music mogul Jay-Z added to the conversation in an interview with Van Jones on CNN in which he discussed his own experience with therapy and \"the ridiculousness of the stigma\" attached to mental health issues; he openly advocated for therapy in schools.\n\nMore recently, in an interview with Forbes about his involvement with Okayplayer's PASSAGE: The Practice of Healing , a new wellness initiative for people of color, the hip-hop artist Big K.R.I.T. talked about mental health and encouraged the Black community to seek counseling services when needed.\n\nMembers of the music industry are not alone in their efforts to increase awareness among Black men about mental health; TV portrayals are also shifting. In a 2020 episode of FX's Dave , GaTa - who plays a version of his real self on the show as hype man to Lil Dicky (Dave Burd) - reveals that he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder . The episode was well received by fans, and GaTa later openly shared his real-life experiences with the diagnosis. And in season four of HBO's Insecure , Issa's on-again, off-again boyfriend Nathan confides in her that he, too, has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder - an issue that's also part of the plot in season five.\n\n5 Helpful Tips for Black Men Seeking Mental Health Care\n\nAlthough some progress has been made toward destigmatizing mental health issues among Black men, more must be done. For Black men who find themselves conflicted about whether to seek a professional counselor and are wondering if it's right for them, here are five things for Black men consider.\n\n1. You have nothing to prove. Black men who are experiencing psychological and emotional health challenges have nothing to prove to anyone but themselves. Of course, there are obligations to loved ones that must be fulfilled, but prioritizing mental and physical wellness so that you can be more present for those who love and depend on you is essential.\n\n2. Treatment, in all its forms, is entirely confidential. All counselors are ethically bound to maintain the confidentiality of their clients and are subject to losing licensure if they fail to do so. Neal-Barnett encourages Black men to not worry about those skeletons; they are safe with your therapist and psychiatrist .\n\n3. You can pick your mental health professional. Sitting down and sharing your deepest and darkest secrets can be difficult for anyone, regardless of biological sex or racial or ethnic background. But one of the great things about seeking services is that, in most cases, you can select the professional with whom you feel most comfortable.\n\n4. There is no shame in seeking treatment. You have probably heard this a million times, but it's true. Neal-Barnett says sometimes the most courageous gesture we can make is to ask for help.\n\n5. Counseling, therapy, and psychiatric treatment are not for \"crazy\" people. This is a stereotype that needs to be retired once and for all. Counseling is for anyone who wants to speak with a non-biased and objective professional in a confidential environment.\n\nChoosing the Specialist Who's Right for You\n\nIf you've made the decision to speak to someone, excellent! But keep in mind that not all mental health professionals are the same, and some offer and focus on different specializations. Do your own research on the best fit for you, but consider starting with your primary care doctor: They can offer further guidance on how to move forward in selecting a mental health professional.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness is a great resource for guidance on the different types of mental health care providers and how to select an expert. Here are some options that may be available to you.\n\nPsychiatrist A psychiatrist has completed a medical residency specializing in psychiatry and earned a medical degree (MD). Psychiatrists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, prescribe medication, and facilitate therapy sessions.\n\nPsychologist A psychologist has earned a doctoral-level degree (PhD or PsyD) specializing in diagnosis, treatment, and therapy. Unlike a psychiatrist, a psychologist cannot prescribe medication.\n\nLicensed professional counselor (LPC) An LPC has earned a graduate-level master's or doctoral degree in counseling (PhD, MS, or MA). A licensed professional counselor specializes in diagnosis and treatment and provides therapy. They often work with clients to develop healthy coping skills and offer a safe space to process experiences. Individuals can also receive specific clinical training and earn licensing to become a marriage, family, and couples therapist (MFT). MFTs are similar to LPCs, but their specialization is not in individual counseling but in working with couples and families. Neither MFTs nor LPCs can prescribe medication.\n\nLicensed clinical social worker (LCSW) An LCSW has completed graduate-level training and has a master's degree in social work (MSW). Like an LPC, they specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness and provide therapy. But they also have specific training in national social welfare policy and support services. Social workers cannot prescribe medication.\n\nPsychiatric mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) A psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, also known as a psychiatric nurse practitioner, is a registered nurse who has earned an additional postgraduate degree and specializes in diagnosing and treating mental illness. Like a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioners are licensed to prescribe medication. In some locations, nurse practitioners can prescribe medication independently, and in other places, they are required to collaborate with a physician.\n\nOnce a person begins working with a mental health provider, they will create a treatment plan based on your specific needs. A treatment plan may or may not include prescription medication, and in fact, most providers aim to help their clients make lifestyle changes rather than take prescription medication in order to work toward their goals. In the event that you and your provider agree that medication is necessary, your psychologist, licensed professional counselor, or social worker will help you find a psychiatrist."

      "text": "Black Men In White Coats: An Initiative To Increase The Number Of Black Men In Medical School\n\nBy Sheila Callaham\n\nBy Sheila Callaham ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBlack Men in White Coats-on a mission to show black youth that they can become doctors, too.\n\nMentoring, Mindset And Motivation For Black Youth\n\nWhen Aaron Dotson was a young boy, he would accompany his mother to her physician's appointments. He was fascinated with the doctor's instruments and asked lots of questions typical of a curious child. Over the years, the African American doctor mentored Dotson, allowing him to shadow his daily routine and encouraging him to study hard so that he, too, could become a doctor.\n\nNot many young black men like Dotson, now in his fourth year of medical school, have a black man in a white coat to model the example of what they can become. But he and other black medical students and physicians volunteer their time to the organization Black Men in White Coats (BMWC), with the mission to increase the number of black men in the field of medicine by exposure, inspiration and mentoring.\n\n\"It's important for black men to see themselves as being more than a stereotype, more than someone who can only plays sports,\" said Dotson. \"We have the ability to achieve and accomplish anything that we want to in this world, and those of us already doing it need to be there to mentor others.\"\n\nIt Takes a Village\n\nDr. Dale Okorodudu launched Black Men in White Coats in response to a 2013 report from the ... More Association of American Medical Colleges that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping.\n\nBMWC was the vision of Dr. Dale Okorodudu, who launched the BMWC website six years ago after seeing a 2013 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) report that the already under-represented percentage of black men in medical school was dropping. While a 2017 AAMC report documented a 53 percent growth among black or African American female medical school graduates since 1986, male graduates had declined 39 percent. During the 2018-2019 academic year, the AAMC reported that medical school enrollment consisted of 7.1 percent black; however, less than half were men.\n\n\"To become a black man in a white coat, you must first see yourself capable of becoming one,\" Okorodudu said. To create that vision, he has networked and partnered with students, physicians and medical schools across the country to expose black youth to the medical field and to provide necessary, ongoing mentorship.\n\nOn the BMWC website, Okorodudu posts podcasts and short video documentaries from both medical students and physicians-all expressly intended to inspire black youth that they, too, can become doctors. He's written books for parents and children to further inspire and educate. He's also created DiverseMedicine.org to increase ethnic and socioeconomic diversity within the field of medicine via mentoring and outreach.\n\nMore than 1,800 youth and parents attended the Black Men in White Coats Summit, exposing youth to ... More careers in medicine.\n\nLast year during Black History Month, Okorodudu and his team organized the first-ever BMWC Youth Summit at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Drawing more than 1,800 attendees, the daylong program offered info sessions for elementary through high school students and their parents and introduced different medical specialties.\n\nAlways seeking ways to amplify his efforts, Okorodudu redesigned the event to make it more affordable and easily replicated across the country. BMWCx is a branded Ted Talk-style summit that can be independently organized by community leaders anywhere.\n\nOkrodudu's next goal is a documentary film that will tear down the false stereotypes of black men in America and demonstrate their potential. Projected for release in February 2021, Okorodudu's quest is that the film not only be educational and inspirational, but it will also be entertaining.\n\nA recent Kickstarter campaign quickly produced the $100,000 he needed to begin. \"There's still a long way to go,\" he said, \"but I'm really excited by this project because it has the potential to make a huge impact.\"\n\nWhy BMWC Is Important\n\nA recent Stanford Health Study showed that black men take more proactive health measures, such as flu shots and diabetes and cholesterol screenings, when treated by a black doctor. The randomized clinical trial among 1,300 black men in Oakland showed that 29 percent more were likely to talk with black doctors about other health problems and seeking more invasive screenings that likely required more trust in the person providing the service.\n\nWhile African-Americans comprise about 13 percent of the population, only 4 percent of physicians and less than 6 percent of medical school graduates are black, according to the study.\n\n\"It was surprising to see the results,\" said Marcella Alsan, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford Medicine, a faculty fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, and an investigator at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. \"Prior to doing the study, we really were not sure if there would be any effect, much less the magnitude. The signal in our data ended up being quite strong.\"\n\nSpecifically, researchers calculated that increased screenings could total up to a 19 percent reduction in the black-white male cardiovascular mortality gap and an eight percent decline in the black-white life expectancy gap.\n\n\"In curative care, the patient feels ill and then may seek out medical care to fix the problem,\" Alsan said. \"But in preventive care, the patient may feel just fine - but must trust the doctor when he is told that certain measures must be taken to safeguard health.\"\n\nNot only is there a shortage of black doctors, there is a shortage of physicians overall. An AAMC Health Care Utilization Equity analysis found that the U.S. would need an additional 95,900 doctors immediately if health care utilization patterns were equalized across race, insurance coverage, and geographic location. Black men, in particular, have the lowest life expectancy in the country.\n\nTo build a health care infrastructure that not only supports medical need but also aspires to reduce healthcare disparities, a pipeline of black male physicians is needed-and that requires exposing, mentoring and advocating on behalf of black male youth.\n\nMedical School is a Journey of Commitment\n\nAaron Dotson is in his fourth year of medical school at the St. Louis University School of Medicine. ... More He knows what a long road it is to medicine and he actively mentors black youth to build a pipeline of future black doctors.\n\nDotson, who plans to become an ophthalmologist, was already set to become a doctor when he met Okorodudu at a pre-med conference in 2015. Recently graduated from UT Dallas, Dotson was so impressed with Okorodudu and the BMWC mission that afterward, Dotson introduced himself.\n\n\"Since then, he's served as a strong mentor for me, going through a lot of my medical school applications and connecting me with plenty of doctors that I still keep in contact with today,\" said Dotson. \"In return, I've supported the BMWC mission by mentoring dozens of students across the country.\"\n\nDotson majored in neuroscience as an undergrad before beginning medical school. He's in the process of applying for an Ophthalmology residency, which means four more years on top of the eight he's already invested.\n\n\"And I'm likely looking to do a fellowship after that, which will be another one to two years, so it's a big commitment,\" he explained. \"Medical school is not cheap; St. Louis University can run you about $50,000 per year in tuition alone.\"\n\nDotson feels that the long commitment and financial obligation is one of the reasons black men never even consider becoming a doctor. \"When you're looking at the amount of loans that you have to take out over the years, and you're not able to make a decent living until residency fellowship and begin to pay those loans back, it seems impossible to so many black men. It's not an easy road at all; but for me, there is nothing on this planet that I want more than to become a doctor.\"\n\nLeaving Legacies\n\nOkorodudu wants better health outcomes for black communities, but he's thinking much bigger than that. He's looking at impacting generations to come.\n\nA big part of what I'm doing is changing the life of the person who becomes a physician. If I can convince a child that he can become a doctor, give him mentorship, guidance on how to access necessary resources and they become a doctor, that changes his life because he earns a physician's income. Now he's in the top five percent of society, and that changes his kids' lives, changes his grandkids' lives-it changes his entire generational legacy.\n\nOkorodudu openly shares that he guided by his Christian faith and belief that, \"To whom much is given, much is required.\" He is grateful for all he has achieved and is committed to paying it forward. His hope is that those on the receiving end will do the same and that, in time, the black man's world will look very different than it does today."

      "text": "How Black Men Can Overcome Adversity, According To 4 Black Business Leaders\n\nBy Maya Richard-Craven\n\nBy Maya Richard-Craven ,\n\nContributor.\n\nClarence Otis Jr. speaks onstage at Jazz at Lincoln Center's 2023 Gala.\n\nMy father was raised in Watts, a low-income community in south Los Angeles. For him, education was the key to a life free of fear. I remember him telling me stories about the neighborhood as a kid. He was fortunate to live in a two-parent household full of unconditional love and food on the table. When he stepped outside of the house, it was an entirely different world.\n\nHe had his punch spiked at a party when he was in elementary school. He witnessed people bleeding from getting stabbed at school. Four housing projects fed into his middle school, and four different gang affiliations were present in middle school alone. He was lucky to have dedicated teachers who enhanced his self-esteem. He was taught he could do anything.\n\nThere are currently eight Black executives at Fortune 500 companies . Although there has been an increase in Black executives, Black men in leadership say hiring practices need to change to increase socioeconomic diversity.\n\nMany Black men from underserved communities don't have the same experience. In 2020, 48% of Black children lived in a single-parent home .\n\n\"My dad left when I was 3 or 4. It was a disadvantage being a young African American boy having to recognize that my father rejected me. You grow up wondering, 'What's wrong with me?' It causes you to doubt things about yourself,\" says Dr. Charles Bray, who manages the small business programs office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is originally from the the east side of Joliet, Illinois, and says that not having a father impacted his mental health.\n\n\"I had to work through the self-esteem issues from not having a dad. If you have your dad around you have an advantage.\"\n\nBray is one of many Black men to attend a prestigious university after being raised in a low-income household. The Illinois native studied electrical engineering at Purdue before getting an MBA from Harvard Business School, and two PhDs from Pepperdine . He hopes to educate the next generation of Black professionals.\n\n\"We need to teach our younger folks what we've learned. You have to embrace the tapestry of who you are as a Black man,\" says Bray. \"Pull the positive threads to craft the best version of yourself.\"\n\nSimilarly, Clarence Otis Jr., the former CEO of The Darden Group, comes from a low-income area and has excelled in his career. Darden is a Fortune 500 company that owns restaurant chains like Ruth's Chris, Olive Garden, and Yard House. In 2022, Darden's net income was $955 million , and it's one of the largest restaurant groups in the world. Otis ran Darden for 10 years, and is one of few Black men to ever be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. He currently serves on corporate boards for Verizon, VF VFC Corporation, and Travelers TRV Corporation.\n\nThe retired businessman was raised in Watts and left after high school to get a political science degree from Williams and a JD from Stanford. He did well in school from a young age and credits his teachers for encouraging him.\n\n\"A key to my success is that I was well read from a very early age,\" he says. \"You could check out a maximum of ten books every two weeks from the public library branch in Watts on 103rd Street. I did that from third grade through eleventh grade.\"\n\nTV shows, movies, and music tend to focus on Black men who are suffering, but Black men in corporate America are changing the narrative.\n\n\"Black men are not a monolith. We are individuals uniquely and wonderfully made,\" he says. \"Some stereotypes are that we are angry, only marginally intelligent, and undisciplined. We live in a society that has perpetrated lies about us in order to exploit us.\"\n\nIt should not come as a surprise that 24.9% of Black men in the United States have bachelors degrees . There are Black men who are surgeons. Others are lawyers. Some are at the helm of major companies.\n\n\"Readers should know that in each of the difficult communities across the country they read about, there are dozens and dozens of kids, even today, that will succeed,\" says Otis. \"Readers are missing huge opportunities if they don't seek those kids out and bring them into their organizations.'\n\nLandon Medlock, a director of product at an Edtech company in San Francisco, believes Black men should uplift each other in corporate spaces. Medlock was raised in a predominantly Black community in Dallas and received a scholarship to attend a local private school. The Stanford alum didn't hold back while discussing how Black men are treated in corporate America.\n\n\"Widespread corporate success has eluded Black people and by extension Black men,\" Medlock says. \"We are in this corporate ladder. We should view success collectively,\" he says. Medlock is just one of many people who believes the successes of Black men should be celebrated within the community.\n\nRon Taylor is a portfolio specialist at T.Rowe Price and is from the Crenshaw District in south Los Angeles. T.Rowe Price manages $1.2 trillion in assets and is the 15th largest asset manager in the world. Taylor believes that the accomplishments of Black men should be seen as wins for the entire community.\n\n\"When a Black professional rises within the highest levels of corporate America other Black professionals celebrate that,\" he says. \"Once someone sees it, they know it's achievable for them. It is a beacon of light for us as a community in terms of what is possible.\""

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe public insults directed at the Black men not voting for Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election are a helpful reminder that the only men Democrats tolerate are obedient allies. The party's views on social progress are shaped in large part by feminists and Pride activists, which means men who want to have any influence on the political Left must be willing to use their \"power\" and \"privilege\" on behalf of women or people in the LGBTQ coalition.\n\nThis explains why some of the most vocal critics of Black men this election cycle have been surrogates who look like us. In the last month we have seen President Barack Obama chastise \"the brothers\" during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh. Spike Lee approved of Obama's tough love approach and said some Black men have been \"drinking that Kool-Aid\" and needed to \"get their minds right\" in time for the election. Jamal Bryant, the pastor of the church Vice President Harris recently addressed, said \"something is wrong with brothers who don't know how to support a sister.\"\n\nThe message from Democrats to Black men who hold to traditional views is simple: Convert to our worldview or expect to be treated like a sexist bigot.\n\nBut as progressives continue to move Left on social issues, they are understandably alienating an increasing number of Black men with traditional values and views on gender and sexuality. Some are conservative Christians who still believe marriage is defined as a lifelong union between one man and one woman. Others may be more moderate when it comes to how people live their personal lives, but don't want LGBT content pushed on their children, whether in the media or in school.\n\nThe Left's scolding tone will not win them over. Neither will the constant accusations of misogyny. Just because a Black man won't wear Roland Martin's \"Vote Like a Black Woman\" shirt does not make him a sexist. Likewise, a Black pastor who is staunchly pro-life is not \"anti-woman\" just because Democrats can point to NBA superstar Stephen Curry, a self-professed Christian and Harris surrogate, as a public supporter of abortion.\n\nThis is the Democrats' way: The party only has room in it for Black men who are willing to subordinate their traditional values to the feminist and queer values of the Left. Every high profile Black man stumping for the Democrats who still has traditional values is going to have to grapple-publicly or privately-with the tension between his views and his role as an ally to higher priority social justice causes.\n\nConsider Charlamagne Tha God, co-host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, whorecently acknowledged the effectiveness of a Trump campaign ad showing Kamala Harris stating her support for \"taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.\" So effusive were his comments that the radio personality, himself a Harris supporter, had to issue a cease and desist order against the Trump campaign after they used his comments in a subsequent ad.\n\nCharlamagne is an outspoken social commentator, but he knows his role in the progressive political ecosystem. The same can be said for other prominent Black male Democrats. This explains why New York City mayor Eric Adams promoted drag queens in the classroom. It's also the reason Maryland governor Wes Moore-a married father of two-is far more vocal about \"trans visibility\" than the importance of the nuclear family.\n\nDemocrats who see LGBTQ activism as a natural continuation of the civil rights movement support men like Raphael Warnock because he helps them make \"trans\" the new \"Black.\" Senator Raphael Warnock represents Georgia in the nation's capital and pastors Dr. King's old congregation, Ebenezer Baptist Church, in Atlanta. Senator Warnock draws on the legacy and moral authority of the Civil Rights movement, but he does not hold to any Biblical positions that would upset his party. Like many of his peers in the pulpit, he celebrates the Black pastors in previous generations who fought against the color line, even as he seems hellbent on destroying the sex binary.\n\nWhat the party will not tolerate are men like Hall of Fame NFL coach Tony Dungy. Dungy displays his Christian values in the work he does to promote faith, family, and fatherhood. He is publicly vilified by progressives for his pro-life views and slammed as a bigot for believing in traditional marriage. This is the treatment every Black man who is not an obedient ally should expect to receive. The only question is how they will respond. White men with traditional values are quite comfortable voting for, and being associated with, the Republican Party . Unfortunately, progressive gatekeepers make life difficult for Black men who make the same choice.\n\nWhen you believe you own a certain constituency and they owe you their vote, even the slightest signs of defection are enough to bring out your ugly side. Democrats could do some self-reflection and listen to Black men, but in the game of intersectional politics where abortion and gender identity are top priorities, concern for the \"privileged\" would be seen by their key constituencies as betrayal of the marginalized.\n\nThat means Black men should prepare for more attacks from the party beholden to the matriarchy both now and in the future.\n\nDelano Squires is a contributor to Blaze Media.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAm I not good enough to compete? Am I being hired because I'm Black and fulfill some quota, or do I stand out from the crowd because of my competency?\n\nThese are the questions Black people like me are forced to consider in this new corporate environment that overtly wants to elevate people based on the complexion of their skin.\n\nIt's a policy philosophy that creates doubt not only within the minds of the minorities who are trying to navigate successfully in corporate America, but their colleagues as well who aren't sure if the person standing beside them is there for the same reasons as them.\n\nI understand the motivation for wanting to help people that some feel are disadvantaged by ensuring a fairer environment for everyone, no matter their ethnicity, sex, or sexuality. But the problem with DEI is that in practice, it is inconsistent with the message that discrimination is bad because it engages in discriminating against some to elevate others. And in so doing, they aren't setting an equal playing field for all but skewing the field to create an ideologically satisfying outcome. And no one likes it when there are favorites in a competitive market, including the people who didn't ask to be anointed.\n\nAs a Black man who has worked in the IT field for well over a decade, I never once questioned why I was being hired for a position prior to the popularization of DEI. There was a solid chemistry in the room during the interviews that resulted in job offers. But after the death of George Floyd , I routinely began to wonder if the job I was hired for was given to me out of some kind of racial motivation instead of thanks to my capabilities as a professional. And for a moment, I questioned if the other Black men in my work environment were also beneficiaries of a diversity agenda.\n\nYes-I, a Black man, fell into that trap progressives like to pretend is racism and wondered if my Black coworkers were diversity hires. And I am not the only one.\n\nOver time, of course, I realized that like me, the other Black men I work with are highly capable, intelligent, and competent, and it would be unfair for me to presume any of us didn't deserve to be standing where we were. But this is one of the many fundamental problems with DEI: It creates paranoia even among the people who theoretically benefit the most from it.\n\nI know that DEI is not about equality because equal hiring practices and treatment in the workplace are already part of the law, and there would be ramifications for violating them. As a matter of fact, DEI praxis actually violates the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) regulations, which stipulate that \"your employer cannot make job decisions because of your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity) national origin, disability, or genetic information.\"\n\nDEI does not act as a repetitive entity that competes with Human Resources in many corporations; it instead supersedes Human Resources' employer-to-employee relationship with a stronger ideological position and purpose dedicated to manipulating outcomes and interactions.\n\nI am a self-respecting Black American man, and I would never want to be treated differently because of something I didn't earn, like having more melanin in my skin than someone else. To me, DEI in corporate America was implemented in the hopes of limiting liability against claims of discrimination, to massage the egos of faux-guilt-riddled white Leftist savior types in leadership, and to give the perception that ruthless capitalists can also be socially conscious.\n\nIt was created for everyone but the people it directly impacts and now we are unfairly blamed as a group when there are white people being discriminated against for opportunities and advancement.\n\nI don't need artificial opportunities: I just want equal treatment.\n\nAdam B.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nOne of the most surprising things to happen in American politics during an election cycle full of surprises has been how well former President Donald Trump is polling with Black men. Poll after poll have shown him with support ranging from 20 percent to almost 40 percent, historic numbers for a Republican since the Civil Rights Act.\n\nBut then the race changed. Now, Trump's opponent is no longer an aging Joe Biden but Vice President Kamala Harris , who is herself Black and Indian.\n\nIs the substitution of Harris going to change Trump's newfound support among Black men?\n\nNot when it comes to this Black man, nor my friends. Most of us are still firmly in the Trump camp.\n\nI grew up in a multi-generational home on the island of St. Croix, which is in the U.S. Virgin Islands. My family migrated to St. Croix from other Caribbean islands during the Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation boom of the 1970s and the Martin Marietta/VIALCO expansion of the 1980s. As Black man of West Indian heritage, my parents always told me the message a lot of other Black kids hear growing up: \"You have three strikes against you already: You are Black, you are poor, and you are a man.\" They told me I would have to work harder and be better than everyone else if I wanted to be competitive in the world.\n\nI didn't understand this growing up. My father and uncle were powerful role models for me. They worked hard to provide for the family and contribute to the community. I didn't really comprehend the context in which being Black or being a man would be held against me. I was raised in a culture where Black people were the majority, where we control the government and all other positions of prominence.\n\nI started to understand what my parents meant when I moved to the U.S. for college to study Chemical & Natural Gas Engineering at Texas A&M University-Kingsville. That was my first exposure to racist stereotypes about Black Americans, including my own encounters being pulled over by traffic cops. Going to college just two hours from the Southern border, I was often asked if I was a U.S. citizen because of my accent.\n\nI graduated from college and started my career as an Engineer-in-Training in the oilfields in 2012. Despite working on the Eagle Ford shale development, I saw the work start to dry up during Barack Obama 's presidency due to his policies. Companies started downsizing to skirt the Affordable Care Act and its mandates, and the added regulations made it tougher on employers to hire new graduates and pay them enough to cover student loans and rent. Environmental regulations at the time resulted in the closing of manufacturing plants and slowdowns in the Oil and Gas sector; the refining capacity on the East Coast was reduced by 25 percent between 2012-2015.\n\nI was unemployed for years under Obama's presidency. Bills went unpaid, and I was homeless for a while, couch-surfing with friends when the economy dipped.\n\nThen, in 2016, my luck changed.\n\nI didn't vote for Donald Trump that year-desperate for a new lease on life, I wrote in Senator Bernie Sanders (my deceased Dominican grandmother would have had a fit if I told her I voted for a socialist!). Yet who could have imagined the economy the Trump administration created? I was hired in December 2016 just on the prospect of the improved economy Trump was likely to build. Not only did his election get me hired back in my industry, but his presidency was so beneficial, I got many other Black friends from college hired on in Oil and Gas, and I saw our lives take off for the better.\n\nI went from being homeless to making $80,000 a year. Suddenly I had a two-bedroom apartment, life insurance, and savings. I was able to go vacation with my then-fiancé several times a year.\n\nBlack men do not have to admire Trump's character to acknowledge his policies worked best for our interests. Many of us had great jobs. We were making money.\n\nThen came President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and like Obama, they prioritized climate change, globalization, expansion of the welfare state, and the advancement of social ideologies over protecting American jobs and families. Their policies had a massively detrimental impact on the economy and the future prospects of the Everyday Man.\n\nThe majority of Black men in America are not professional athletes or celebrities-but we're also not poor or homeless or on welfare; we are everyday, hardworking men seeking to move ahead in life. And the Left seems to make that much harder-by hobbling the economy on the one hand, then pushing music and culture that tells men we're nothing if we aren't rich. It's a one-two punch for the three strikes Black man.\n\nAt the end of the day, all Americans want the same things: life, liberty, safety and security. For me and many of my Black male friends, reelecting President Trump gives us the best opportunity to become providers for our families and to get dignity from good paying jobs.

He has covered technological and cultural issues extensively in the U.S. and the U.K., such as the rise of Elon Musk and other tech figures within the conservative movement, and the development of high-profile international construction projects.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt was a classic hot mic moment: while Kamala Harris grabbed a beer at a bar in Michigan with Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday, the Vice President apparently let slip that her campaign was struggling to get through to male voters.\n\n\"We need to move ground among men,\" she was heard to confide, seemingly unaware the mic was still on.\n\nIn particular, Harris has been striving to reach young Black voters, at one point recruiting former president Barack Obama to put his shoulder to the wheel. Responses on social media suggested the intervention backfired , with many considering his remarks to be disrespectful and patronizing.\n\nNow new analysis seen by Newsweek shows that Harris' task has been made more difficult by the decline in church attendance by young Black men in America.\n\nThe Democrats have long enjoyed and relied upon support from this demographic: since 1980, no Democrat has failed to receive less than 80 percent of the Black vote, with churches and religious communities serving as a vital channel of communication for the Democratic party.\n\nHarris, a Baptist and former choirgirl with a long history of civil rights campaigning, is seemingly well placed to connect with religious leaders.\n\nHowever the church seems to be losing support among younger voters, blowing a hole in Harris' outreach.\n\nResearch by the 2040 Strategy Group shows that Millennial and Gen Z voters are now over 45 percent of the Black electorate, and that these same groups are significantly less engaged with the church than older generations.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, the Baby Boomer generation are significantly more religious than Millennials and Gen Z voters - some 50 percent of Boomers reported that they regularly attend Black congregations. Just three-in-ten Millennials and Gen Z voters said they attended.\n\nDr. Tabitha Bonilla, co-founder of the 2040 Strategy Group and an expert on voting behavior, told Newsweek that the decline in congregation attendance was partly a cultural trend, as younger people are less likely to hold strong religious beliefs.\n\n\"There has been a generational decline in church attendance. Pew's data estimates about a 13% drop in attendance of a Black church from the oldest generations to the youngest. And, in addition to being less likely to attend a Black church, younger generations are simply much less religious in general and less likely to be connected to a Black church at all.\n\n\"Ultimately, what I think this means is that political organizers need to be responsive to the changes in Black communities. They cannot try the same old organizing techniques or assume that the messages that get older Black voters to the polls are the same ones that turnout younger Black voters,\" she said.\n\nThe Harris campaign appears to know this, turning to less traditional campaign tactics to reach younger Black voters.\n\nHarris' radio interview with Charlamagne tha God, a young Black shock-jock-turned political-pundit, was much better received than earlier campaign events, and trendier ads that take advantage of social media formats have also preformed well online .\n\nHarris has been rewarded with some encouraging data towards the end of the race.\n\nA 2040 Strategy Group poll, gathered between October 4-19, showed her up 10 points with Gen Z Black men since the beginning of October, putting her on par with Biden's share of the Black vote in 2020.\n\nDr. Alvin Tillery, founder of the Alliance for Black Equality, told Newsweek that Harris' alternative campaigning style has paid off.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has the potential to get to where she needs to be with Black male voters in order to win on November 5th. In just three weeks, she has made serious gains with young Black men and increased their support of her by 10 points,\" he said.\n\n\"Our previous tracking polls have showed that softer than normal support for Biden and Harris in the Black electorate during the 2024 presidential election cycle is driven by a cohort replacement effect in the Black community.\n\n\"Millennial and Gen Z voters, who are less attached to the Democratic Party and harder to reach through traditional methods of getting out the vote, Black churches and 501c3 nonprofits, are now between 45 percent and 50 percent of the Black electorate.\n\n\"Every pledge of support counts and is a sign that Harris' shift in strategy to speak more directly to the Black community is a smart move,\" Dr. Bonilla said.\n\nHarris still has some way to go: her support among Black voters currently stands at 87%, with some voters still making up their minds. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won over 90 percent of the Black protestant vote, while Biden enjoyed 90% in the last election.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama made visiting churches and local Black communities a central part of both his election campaigns, and Biden's closeness with South Carolina's Black leaders was pivotal in his victory during the 2019 Democratic primary.\n\nPeter Loge, a former adviser within the Obama administration, told Newsweek that strong support from Black voters has consistently given Democrats the edge in important swing states , and could be the difference this election.\n\n\"Roughly one third of Georgians are African American, as are roughly one in four North Carolinians. Both states are important to both candidates, and both states could go either way. Even in states with smaller Black populations, every vote matters so every voter is important,\" he said.\n\nTrump has also been making gains among Black voters throughout all three of his presidential elections. Between the 2016 and 2020 election, he increased his share of the Black vote by 4 points, rising from 8 percent to 12 percent, and polls indicate he could be on track to make a similar jump this year.\n\nA poll released by the NAACP on Tuesday showed 63 percent of Black voters favor Harris over Trump, but that still gives Trump a decent chunk of the electorate. Additionally, while support for Harris among Black women remains strong at 67 percent, it falls to 49 percent among Black men under 50, again highlighting a gender divide.\n\n\"In an election this close every vote could make a difference. A lack of Black support for either Trump or Harris voters could cost them the White House,\" Loge said.\n\nNewsweek contacted the Harris campaign for comment on this story via email.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIn both 2008 and 2012, I was proud to be an Ohio delegate for President Barack Obama . So I was shocked to hear what former President Obama had to say while speaking to Black men during a surprise visit to Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign field office in Pittsburgh.\n\nHis words made my jaw hit the floor. In fact, they made my blood boil.\n\nPresident Obama had some choice words for the enthusiasm gap for Vice President Harris specifically when it comes to Black men. \"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" President Obama said , and then went on to lecture Black men about their lack of support for Harris. \"Part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nI was infuriated to hear these remarks. No other group of voters is talked to like this, as if they are children. But it's not just the paternalistic tone that had me enraged. It's the underlying message in his words-that Black men are misogynistic and can't bring themselves to vote for a woman.\n\nThis vilification of our men is out of line. For starters, it's false. Black men are socialized in the same patriarchal society that every other American man is socialized in, yet when Secretary Hillary Clinton ran for President in 2016, 81 percent of Black men voted for her, while only 32 percent of white men did the same.\n\nAs for Black men allegedly being so reticent to vote for Vice President Harris, her lowest numbers are with Black men under 50 years old-72 percent of whom support Harris.\n\nIf white men supported Harris at 72 percent, they'd be held up as an example of how men can support women. So why are Democratic Party leaders like former President Obama vilifying Black men?\n\nIt's simple: The Democratic Party is setting Black men up to take the fall in case Vice President Harris fails to defeat former President Trump in November. It's that simple.\n\nAnd it is an outrage that they are trying to pin this on Black men. If Harris loses, it will not be on Black men or any other group of voters. The fault will lie squarely with the candidate and the party she represents.\n\nIt is her job to appeal to Black men-not to lecture those who aren't feeling it.\n\nI've spoken to some of them personally. In recent years, after my time as an Ohio State Senator and the Chair of Engagement for the Ohio Democratic Party, I've traveled our country talking to voters-especially Black working class people. I've spent the past year in rooms with Black labor leaders and rank and file members, with Black-led organizations organizing for reparations and Black elected officials. Just this week, my organization We Are Somebody Fund announced a significant investment in Black voter outreach for this election.\n\nI have talked at length with Black men who vote. My dad is a Black man who votes. My son is a Black man who votes. My brother is a Black man who votes. Most of the Black men in my life vote.\n\nThe Black men I speak to who are not enthusiastic about Vice President Harris are not enthusiastic with the Democratic Party as a whole. They feel left behind and ignored. Black men are concerned with the economy, jobs, the criminal justice system, and wages-issues they do not see the Democratic Party addressing aggressively enough.\n\nThey shouldn't be blamed for the Democratic Party's failures. They should be granted the dignity of voting on their interests as they perceive them like everyone else. And if the Democratic Party is failing to galvanize their support, maybe the Party should ask what it's doing wrong, rather than blaming Black men.\n\nWe're seeing something of a historical development in this election cycle. On May 22, 1962, Minister Malcolm X addressed a group of Black people in Los Angeles, California, in which he spoke to the plight of Black women. He said, \"The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman.The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman.\"\n\nHe was correct, and sadly, this still rings true today. But I think if Minister Malcolm X was alive today, he might see things a bit more expansively. These days, it feels like the most vilified person in America is the Black man.\n\nWhen Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee, it was widely accepted that she would have to choose a white man as her running mate to appeal to white voters. To appeal to never-Trump Republicans , the Harris-Walz campaign is holding events with former GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney . They've invited multiple Republicans to speak at the DNC , and Vice President Harris has even committed to appointing a Republican to her cabinet if elected.\n\nYet Black men who are already feeling pushed out of the Party get scolded and painted as misogynistic if they feel rejected or ignored. Black men overwhelmingly vote for Democrats . Black men overwhelmingly support the woman running for President. Black men do support women. I am a witness. I am blessed to have Black men in my life who support me.\n\nOut of all the groups of men, Black men are the backbone of men in the Democratic Party. It's time they are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve and not spoken to like children who need to be told what to do.\n\nIt's setting Black men up to be the scapegoats in case of a Trump victory. This Black woman will not stand for it.\n\nNina Turner is a former Ohio state senator, a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at the New School, and the founder of We Are Somebody.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSome pollsters are concluding that Black men are trending conservative. They're asking the wrong question. Black men have always spanned the ideological spectrum. We have nuanced political views that don't fit neatly into the liberal vs. conservative binary. The real question is what we can do to invite more Black men, especially young men, into the political process.\n\nNew research from a four-year project to study the Black electorate shows that while almost half (41 percent) of Black people believe in their power to come together and make change, 22 percent are cynical about politics and elections, and another 18 percent are susceptible to this disillusionment. Millions of young Black men fall into the cluster researchers call \"rightfully cynical.\" They aren't convinced that voting will change their material conditions. The researchers call their cynicism rightful because politicians and institutions have failed to serve their interests. POWER Interfaith and other groups commissioned the research because we wanted to better understand the diversity of the Black electorate, especially among Black men.\n\nWe represent some of that diversity. Greg Edwards, a Gen X-er, was raised in a segregated New Jersey town in the 1970s, where every push for progress was met with resistance. Marcus Bass is a millennial from North Carolina who was politically awakened during the Black Lives Matter protests of the 2010s. But in our work as community organizers and in our personal lives, we both hear the same thing: many young Black men feel ignored, misunderstood and outright betrayed by the political system.\n\nIf we are serious about protecting democracy, we cannot afford to blame or shame young Black men who feel that way. Simply telling them their ancestors faced fire hoses to win the right to vote won't move them, especially when they are still protesting the same injustices today, including police violence. What we need to do instead is break their isolation and help them feel seen and heard. We must create spaces that genuinely embrace Black men, encouraging open dialogue without imposing conformity or diminishing their diverse experiences into a monolithic narrative.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, POWER Interfaith is creating spaces for authentic conversations for young Black men and women where we listen more than we preach. Older folks from the \"legacy civil rights\" generation are hosting soul food dinners in homes and church basements where young people can talk freely about their lives. At a recent dinner, as a result of a judgment-free, intergenerational conversation, a young man who hadn't voted since 2016 realized he may not be interested in politics, but politics was interested in him: government policies affect the rent he pays, the mortgage he might be denied, and the promotion he might miss. He saw the connection between what is on the ballot and his daily life and decided to step back into the political process.\n\nIn the South, North Carolina Black Alliance is partnering with lifestyle influencers, party promoters and fitness groups to start political conversations in a way that feels natural, not forced. For example, a running club in Charlotte attracts more than 300 young Black people every week. Events like these, which bring together young Black people to foster joy and build community, do a better job connecting people than a campaign rally. Culture builds a bridge between what people love and what they can do to make their lives better.\n\nWhat the research shows, and what we are seeing around dinner tables in Philadelphia and running clubs in North Carolina, is when rightful cynics meet each other, they feel less alone. They realize there is strength in their numbers. Even if they feel like their one vote doesn't matter, with their collective power, they can decide what laws and policies get passed. They can hold politicians accountable for delivering real solutions for their community. This is where the magic happens-not in the war rooms of political consultants-but in the streets or anywhere young Black people unite and demand better for themselves.\n\nOur love for our community knows no divorce clause. We are bound together by our shared history and collective hope for the future. That's the beauty of our work as community organizers-it compels us to confront differences, sit with discomfort and ultimately choose one another. Across all our differences, we can build a multiracial democracy that works for everyone. The work continues, no matter who wins in November.\n\nRev.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe hosts of The View discussed Barack Obama's remarks on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday night, debating the political strategy of using the former president as a surrogate to speak directly to Black male voters who may not be enthusiastic about turning out for her.\n\nObama hit the trail in force for the first time of the campaign, rallying voters in Pittsburgh , a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state of Pennsylvania. As part of his campaign swing, Obama told a group of Black men: \"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and reasons for that.\"\n\nPolls show a neck-and-neck race between Harris and former President Donald Trump , with a new Quinnipiac poll out on Wednesday showing Harris up three points with likely voters in Pennsylvania. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percent.\n\n\"I think he's out there because she needs to secure men,\" Alyssa Farah Griffin said, referring to Obama's rally. \"She's behind Biden's numbers with men across the board, but specifically Black men. I think that's who Obama was talking to.\"\n\nSunny Hostin agreed that \"misogyny is a real thing in this country,\" before arguing that Harris' issue lies with white and Latino male voters , not with Black men.\n\n\"I don't think Black men are the problem. Black men are used to matriarchy. Black men are used to Black women being the heads of the family, with Black grandmothers raising them,\" Hostin said. \"Hispanic men, they're more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on key issues.\"\n\nHostin also said the vice president needs to connect with more White women.\n\n\"You've got 53% of white women that voted for him in 2020 we've got to reach those women,\" Hostin said. \"We've got to reach those ridiculous, crazy black men that did vote for Trump. We've got to reach those people. We've got to reach the Cuban men in Miami that overwhelmingly voted for Trump.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Harris taped a town hall hosted by Univision, where she answered questions from an audience of undecided voters in Las Vegas, discussing topics such as immigration and health care.\n\nThe Univision event was a chance for Harris to appeal to Latino voters, especially those in swing states such as Nevada and Arizona. The demographic proved vital for the Democrats in 2020, but recent polls have suggested Harris is losing the Hispanic and Latino vote to Trump.\n\nAna Navarro expressed her desire to see Harris hold more town halls, as they offer a different format from her usual venues and allow her to answer questions directly in an unscripted way.\n\n\"We shouldn't only be sending Obama to speak to Black men, Latinos to speak to Latinos, Bill Clinton to speak to Southerners,\" Navarro said.\n\n\"Kamala Harris needs to speak to these people.\"\n\nFormer president Clinton is expected to hit the campaign trail for Harris as soon as next week, when he will be dispatched to some of the southern battlegrounds in a targeted appeal to rural voters, CNN reported Thursday.\n\nFarah Griffin said with only 25 days until Election Day , Harris' strategy for the final stretch should focus on energizing the Democratic base, reaching out to men and convincing voters of all demographics that she represents a change from the leadership of the past eight years, not just the last four.\n\n\"Ultimately, I think one of the things this election will come down to is which candidate is seen as the agent of change,\" Farah Griffin said.\n\nHostin also said she was confused why her question to Harris earlier this week, when the candidate appeared on the show, received so much attention .\n\nHostin had asked whether Harris would change anything from the Biden administration, to which Harris replied \"not a thing comes to mind.\" Some pundits suggested that Harris flubbed that answer, given that voters say they want to see more daylight between her and the president.\n\nHostin said: \"The Biden administration has had one of the best records of any presidency in decades, so why change something that ain't broken?\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nCourtney McGinley is a Newsweek Fellow, Live News based in Pittsburgh, PA.

Why So Many of Us Won't Vote for Her | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris had better do more work to win over Black men, because right now, her polling numbers look like they are stuck in the waiting room of a DMV, especially when compared to previous Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nA recent poll from the NAACP shows that Harris is underperforming with Black voters-especially Black men. 79 percent of Black women over 50 said they would vote for Harris, but only 66 percent of men over 50 are planning to do so. Just 56 percent of Black voters aged 18 to 49 support Harris, which suggests that her campaign is struggling to energize this demographic.\n\nWhy are Black men so disenchanted with Harris?\n\nDemocrats have faced challenges reaching Black men at the grassroots level. There is a growing sense that Democrats , in general, are not doing enough to reach these voters in a meaningful way. Black male voters feel neglected by a party that has taken their votes for granted for decades without doing much in return for their loyalty. Over the past few years, Black men have become increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic Party , and the divide is even more pronounced among younger Black men.\n\nOn the social front, the Democratic Party is out of step with many minority communities, with a far-Left agenda that is more at home in the faculty lounge than the barber shop. But even on bread-and-butter issues, Black men have lost trust in the Party to represent our interests, starting with our very real economic interests.\n\nDarvio Morrow, host of \"The Outlaws Radio Show\" and CEO of First Class Broadcasting, believes that Black men seek tangible solutions that Democrats have failed to provide. \"Black men are asking 'What's in it for us?'\" He told me. \"Black men have felt neglected and dismissed by the Democratic establishment and ignored by the Republican establishment. This time around, platitudes aren't enough for many of these voters.\"\n\nMorrow pointed out that some Black men \"are choosing to respond favorably to Trump because they believe that their lives were better when he was in office, while others are still sitting on the sidelines asking for both of these candidates to give specifics on how their policies will improve the lives of these voters.\"\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to the economic struggles Black Americans are facing under the Biden-Harris administration. Black men, especially younger ones, feel their economic problems , such as stagnant wages and the rising cost of living, are not being addressed. The NAACP poll showed that 82 percent of Black men under 50 indicated that economic concerns was at the top of the list of important issues-double that of the number overall.\n\nEconomic concerns are related to another big motivating factor in Black men abandoning the Dems: immigration. Online influencer and business owner Trey Quinn, also known as \"The Strong Dad,\" cited the Biden-Harris' failure to address immigration. \"As a trade worker, I deal directly with the job loss due to Illegal immigration, and this has been handled poorly under her watch,\" he told me. Quinn also argued that Harris' plans \"to benefit those at the lowest end of the totem pole\" is aimed more at \"newly legitimized immigrant communities\" rather than Black Americans.\n\nAnd then there's Harris' record as a prosecutor. That's a deal-breaker for Quin, an ex-convict: \"I don't trust corrupt prosecutors or prosecutors with hidden records.\"\n\nHarris' prosecutorial record has been a source of contention for many in the Black community, who believe she contributed to mass incarceration during her stint as California's attorney general and in prior positions. Her perceived role in imposing policies that disproportionately affected Black Americans has created a deep distrust among many Black men.\n\nAnd then there's the flip-flopping, which was cited to me as a red flag by actor and film producer Isaiah Washington, who feels Harris cannot be trusted due to her inconsistent policy positions. \"Kamala Harris has been profoundly disingenuous about her past positions on multiple policies,\" as well as other aspects of her beliefs, including those about herself, Washington told me. \"Why should I believe or trust anything that she says about anything?\"\n\nThese men are not outliers, according to polling. Their concerns about Harris's honesty, her record on immigration, and her economic approach are shared by many Black men, it turns out.\n\nThis election is poised to be a turning point for our community.\n\nThe numbers don't lie. With the election fast approaching, Harris has little room for error as this will be a close election. If her campaign cannot figure out how to energize Black men and regain their trust, this voting bloc could become a liability-instead of a group Democrats have counted on for decades.\n\nWithout a clear pivot to address our concerns, Democrats could be in for a rude awakening at the polls on Election Day.\n\nJeff Charles is the host of \"A Fresh Perspective\" podcast and a contributor for RedState and the Daily Caller.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump won more Black voters than any Republican candidate was able to do in nearly fifty years, an analyst said Friday.\n\nCNN's Harry Enten looked at different demographics in the 2024 election, finding big gains for the GOP candidate compared to previous election cycles.\n\nTrump's voter base remained white and working-class people, but the rise in the number of other groups, including Black, Hispanic and first-time voters allowed him a pathway to the White House.\n\n\"The breadth of the improvement Donald Trump had... holy Toledo!\" he said on CNN News Central.\n\n\"These are the types of groups that you would never have thought Donald Trump would have gained so much support among eight years ago when he first went against Hilary Clinton.\"\n\nThe shift among Black voters came from younger men. In Wisconsin, for example, Trump's support among that group more than doubled.\n\nNationally, he roughly doubled his support among Black men under 45 compared to 2020, with about 3 in 10 in this age group voting for him. In total, 21 percent of Black men voted for Trump, which was 2 percent more than in 2020.\n\nThe shift contributed to Trump's improved margins in battleground states like North Carolina and Georgia, where his share of the Black vote rose by 5 percentage points over 2020 levels.\n\nBlack women overwhelmingly voted for Vice President Kamala Harris , however, with 91 percent of the vote, according to NBC 's exit poll, a one-point rise on President Joe Biden 's result in 2020.\n\nWhen it came to Hispanic voters, Trump showed the best results for a Republican candidate in over 52 years.\n\n\"If the 2016 election was about Donald Trump breaking through with white, working class voters this election was about breaking through, going through that Democratic Party coalition and tearing it apart,\" Enten said.\n\nTrump gained ground among all voters in 49 states and Washington, D.C., in Tuesday's vote, something not seen for any party since 1992 when Bill Clinton won the presidency.\n\n\"No matter where you looked on the map, Donald Trump was improving on where he did four years ago, except for Washington State,\" Enten said.\n\nTrump managed to win over more men and white women, despite concerns around abortion, while also welcoming more first-time voters.\n\nThe shift trickled down into Senate races, where Republicans managed to flip the chamber.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Is Working to Earn the Votes of Black Men With a Strong New Plan | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFor several years now, sincere, Left-leaning Black male political analysts have been warning Democrats that they could lose enough Black men's votes to alter the outcome of a presidential election. As Democrats have reached out to many other demographics, advocating for them with rhetoric and policy, a small but growing number of Black men have felt left behind and ignored, watching Democrats seek to gain favor with groups who have been less devoted to the Party.\n\nA recent nationwide poll conducted by the NAACP found that 26 percent of Black men under the age of 50 supported former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election, with the economy being their top issue. While Harris holds a massive lead over Trump among Black voters as a whole, swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia will undoubtedly be determined by which candidate turns out their base. Harris cannot afford to lose votes either to Trump or to attrition.\n\nThat's why on Monday morning, Vice President Harris charted a new course for Democrats by directly reaching out to Black men and addressing their economic concerns.\n\nThe Vice President has made supporting small business growth a key staple of her campaign. While Donald Trump touts his utterly failed Opportunity Zones program to African Americans, Harris' plan is to invest in Black men realizing the American Dream of innovation and ownership. There is dignity in all work, but many young, working-class Black men want to work for themselves rather than do hourly work for faceless corporations. Harris plans to have 1 million loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs from underserved communities. Understanding that nine out 10 business startups fail, the loans are also fully forgivable.\n\nThe plan also calls for decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and helping Black men join the booming recreational cannabis industry. It's a welcome idea, and not the reversal many are calling it. Vice President Harris's record on criminal justice has always been misconstrued. She sent very few people to state prison for a marijuana convictions as District Attorney of San Francisco. Harris actually started a program called \"Back on Track\" in 2005, which had the stated objective of reducing \"recidivism among low level drug trafficking defendants.\" The program was wildly successful and became a model for districts around the country.\n\nCompare that with her opponent in the race. Former President Donald Trump's approach to criminal justice is far more punitive. In addition to expanding the racially disparate death penalty and giving police officers full immunity for illegal brutality, Trump has promised to reincarcerate people who are in home confinement. Home confinement allows people with minor convictions to maintain jobs and continue with education or job training. It helps families, especially Black men, to maintain familial ties with their children and continue providing for their families. In 2018, Donald Trump did sign the First Step Act. Yet since then, we have heard nothing about a second or third step. His plans for a second term on criminal justice will be a step backward for Black men both socially and economically.\n\nHarris also plans to incentivize Black men to become teachers. This part of her plan is a major investment in Black men and families. As of 2021, Black men comprised just 1.3 percent of teachers, despite Black students making up 15 percent of the student body nationally. Research shows that having Black male teachers raises graduation rates for Black students. A 2018 study found that contact with a Black male elementary school teacher decreases dropout rates by 39 percent for Black boys and increases college aspirations by 19 percent. More education often means a better economic future for Black men and their families.\n\nTo be extremely clear, if Vice President Harris loses this election, it will not fall upon the shoulders of Black men. African American men trail only Black women in their loyalty to the Democratic Party . With women's bodily autonomy and healthcare on the ballot, one could certainly look to white women.\n\nStill, Vice President Harris is working to earn Black men's votes by addressing their economic, social, and healthcare needs with her new plan. The only concern is if it will reach the intended audience quickly enough to garner their enthusiasm.\n\nDr. Jason Nichols is an award winning senior lecturer in the African American Studies Department at the University of Maryland College Park and was the longtime editor-in-chief of Words Beats & Life: The Global Journal of Hip-Hop Culture.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Kamala Harris Promotes Federal Pot Legalization As a Boon to Black Men\n\nKamala Harris\n\nJacob Sullum | 10.15.2024 3:40 PM\n\nKamala Harris, the first major-party presidential candidate to support repeal of the federal ban on marijuana, is presenting that step as part of her \"agenda to give Black men the tools to build wealth and achieve financial freedom, lower costs for themselves and their families, and protect their rights.\" Whatever you think of that framing, which is a transparent ploy to lure African-American voters who might be tempted to vote for Donald Trump, it is reassuring that the vice president has not abandoned her advocacy of national legalization, which she backed as a California senator in 2018 and 2019.\n\nUnlike President Joe Biden, who touted his \"marijuana reform\" but resisted the idea of descheduling cannabis, Harris promises to \"legalize marijuana at the federal level to break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back.\" That position also sets her apart from Trump, who has endorsed recreational legalization in Florida but has not said anything about resolving the conflict between state and federal marijuana laws.\n\nHarris' proposal is short on details, but it sounds like her legalization plan includes expungement of marijuana-related criminal records and \"social equity\" provisions that aim to assist would-be cannabis suppliers from communities disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs. Both of those were elements of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act , a bill she introduced in 2019.\n\nThat bill would have created \"an automatic process\" for \"the expungement, destruction, or sealing of criminal records for cannabis offenses.\" It also would have created \"a trust fund to support various programs and services for individuals and businesses in communities impacted by the war on drugs,\" using revenue from a 5 percent federal tax on cannabis products.\n\nHarris envisioned a Community Reinvestment Grant Program, which would provide grants to \"administer services for individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs,\" and an Opportunity Trust Fund, which would \"assist small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\" The latter fund also would have supported state and local \"equitable licensing\" programs aimed at \"minimiz[ing] barriers to cannabis licensing and employment for individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.\"\n\nExpungement would be a welcome complement to legalization. During his 2020 campaign, Biden promised to \"automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions,\" and he later claimed he was \"expunging thousands of convictions.\" But that was not true, since expungement of federal records would require new legislation.\n\n\"Equitable licensing,\" by contrast, is a well-meaning but misguided concept that unfairly puts qualified applicants at a disadvantage, distorts the cannabis market, and delays the rollout of legalization. Harris says her current plan will create \"opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in this new industry.\" While working with Congress to legalize \"the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana,\" she says, she will strive to ensure that \"Black men-who have, for years, been overpoliced for marijuana use-are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.\"\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll conducted last October, 70 percent of Americans-including 87 percent of Democrats, 70 percent of independents, and 55 percent of Republicans- support marijuana legalization. As relevant here, Gallup put support among \"people of color\" at 72 percent. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in January found less support for recreational legalization: 57 percent overall. Notably, support was especially strong among black respondents, 65 percent of whom said marijuana should be legal for both recreational and medical use.\n\nIn a roundup of cannabis industry reactions to Harris' stance, Forbes writer Iris Dorbian quotes Ethos Cannabis CEO Gibran Washington, who welcomed the candidate's plan as a \"landmark shift that will catalyze both industry growth and scientific advancement.\" Anthony Coniglio, CEO and president of NewLake Capital Partners, which serves marijuana businesses, was more cautious, noting that legalization will require politically iffy congressional action. \"While we applaud Harris' commitment to addressing the harm caused by the War on Drugs and the disproportionate impact of mass incarceration on communities of color,\" he said, \"it remains unclear if there will be enough bipartisan support to fully realize her reform proposals.\"\n\nSundie Seefried, CEO of SHF Holdings, which provides financial services to the cannabis industry, noted that \"states have developed their own regulatory frameworks over years, and forcing them to adjust to federal standards could create substantial complications.\" Although \"the intent is good,\" she said, the \"significant challenges\" posed by reconciling state and federal regulations could \"delay progress for the industry.\"\n\nWill highlighting her support for federal legalization help Harris with wavering black voters? If Trump is worried, there is a straightforward way to neutralize any advantage the issue might give her. He could reinforce his avowed support for marijuana federalism by joining her in opposing the main obstacle to it.\n\n[This post has been updated with additional discussion of expungement and \"social equity\" programs.]\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "No, Stacey Abrams Is Not Losing Because of 'Misinformation' Aimed at Black Men\n\nElection 2022\n\nRobby Soave | 11.8.2022 5:55 PM\n\nStacey Abrams is the Democratic Party's nominee for governor of Georgia. Today's election is a rematch against incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who defeated her in 2018.\n\nLast time, Abrams came close enough to victory that the party catapulted her to stardom. Mainstream media minted her a sort of political genius-an expert on mobilizing minority voters, who tend to be very loyal to Democrats. Abrams became a crusader for the cause of voting rights , and was a frequent subject of glowing national magazine profiles .\n\nYet Abrams is projected to lose once again-this time, by a somewhat larger margin . The race between incumbent Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) and challenger Hershel Walker (R) appears to be much closer than the race between Kemp and Abrams, which suggests that there are some Warnock voters who intend to split their ticket, or leave the gubernatorial ballot blank. Some evidence has emerged that Abrams is particularly struggling with men of color; while she is still likely to capture the overwhelming majority of black male voters in Georgia, her support among this key constituency appears to have fallen by about 8 points.\n\nWhat explains the lack of enthusiasm for Abrams? The candidate herself is blaming an increasingly familiar bogeyman for Democrats: the dreaded specter of \"misinformation,\" which she claims is aimed at black men.\n\n\"Unfortunately this year, black men have been a very targeted population for misinformation,\" said Abrams during a recent interview.\n\nKeisha Lance Bottoms, a former Democratic mayor of Atlanta, expressed hearty agreement in an interview on MSNBC.\n\n\"I think that Stacey is spot on with that,\" said Bottoms. \"I listen as my kids watch NBA highlights and whatever else they watch on YouTube. I hear the misinformation being piped in.\"\n\nBrittney Cooper, an author and activist, took things a step further while speaking at Harvard University, referring to the \"demon of disinformation\" that was causing black men to vote for Warnock but not for Abrams.\n\nNeither Abrams nor her campaign surrogates have identified specific falsehoods or misleading statements. This speaks to a much larger problem with Democratic, progressive, and mainstream media discourse on misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation-concepts that have increasingly captivated Team Blue, but are now so broadly applied as to be almost useless. Pundits and political figures complaining about misinformation might as well be saying that they don't like speech that is critical of them.\n\nThe obsession with misinformation is an inheritance of the 2016 presidential election, and choices made by Democrats in the wake of Hillary Clinton's unexpected loss. The campaign's preferred explanation for this shocking development was that Russian malfeasance on social media tossed the election to Donald Trump. This explanation never made all that much sense, given that most of these influence campaigns were much less impressive than they seemed. The older, white working-class voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania whose shifting allegiance cost Clinton the election were just as likely to have soured on Democrats due to political advocacy within traditional media- radio and cable news, for instance.\n\nObviously, political campaigns have actively engaged in mudslinging, dirty partisanship, and naked lying since the dawn of the republic . But when political figures warn of \"misinformation,\" they are specifically gesturing at a sort of conspiratorial nefariousness, often Russian in origin. Much hay was made about Russian trolls allegedly targeting black voters , though it was never clear why this would have made much difference in the 2016 election-or why it was not just wrong but sinister for anyone to try to persuade black voters to vote differently.\n\nUnfortunately, this paranoia about misinformation has become the default lens through which the media examines modern U.S. politics. And it has prompted federal government officials to push social media companies to do more to combat the alleged scourge, at the risk of seriously compromising free speech rights on those platforms.\n\nBoth parties whine when they lose, and Republican delusions about stolen elections are especially pathetic. But it's also delusional for a candidate to think they're losing because of a pernicious, Russian-based conspiracy to make minority voters think twice about their loyalty to Democrats.\n\nMaybe black voters actually have legitimate questions about how Abrams' voting rights non-profit spent its money?\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Gun Control Is Just as Racist as Drug Control\n\n2nd Amendment\n\nJacob Sullum | From the February 2022 issue\n\nSheila Jackson Lee, a black Democrat who has represented downtown Houston in Congress since 1995, thinks repealing marijuana prohibition is \"an important racial justice measure.\" Twice in the last three years, she has sponsored or co-sponsored bills that would have removed cannabis from the list of federally proscribed substances, eliminating a ban first imposed in 1937. \"Thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from the federal criminalization of marijuana,\" Jackson Lee said in 2020, \"particularly in communities of color.\"\n\nLike the war on weed, gun control is historically rooted in racism and disproportionately harms African Americans. But on the latter issue, Jackson Lee's agenda is decidedly different.\n\nIn 2021, Jackson Lee introduced a bill that would create an elaborate nationwide system to license gun owners, register firearms, and punish violators with the sort of harsh mandatory minimum penalties that she passionately condemns when they are imposed on drug offenders. Jackson Lee frames her proposed restrictions as sensible public safety measures-just as pot prohibitionists have always done.\n\nJackson Lee embodies a common contradiction. Progressive politicians nowadays overwhelmingly oppose pot prohibition and criticize the war on drugs, in no small part because of its bigoted origins and racially skewed costs. Yet they overwhelmingly favor tighter restrictions on guns, even though such policies have a strikingly similar history and contemporary impact.\n\nDrug control and gun control are unjust because they criminalize conduct that violates no one's rights, which erodes civil liberties, contributes to mass incarceration, and unfairly imposes lifelong restrictions on millions of Americans. All of that would still be true even if those policies affected different racial and ethnic groups equally. But for progressives who decry \"systemic racism,\" the drug war's disparate impact makes it especially troubling, and you might think they would see gun control in a similar light.\n\nBoth types of policies have long targeted racial and ethnic minorities, at first explicitly and later in practice. Worse, the costs of these two strategies build on each other. People convicted of drug felonies permanently lose the right to arms, and illegal drug users likewise are not allowed to own guns. Gun possession exposes drug offenders to heavier penalties, whether or not they use firearms to threaten or harm anyone. Drug possession sends gun-law violators back to prison, and gun possession sends drug-law violators back to prison. The burdens of these interacting prohibitions are strongly correlated with race, which by Jackson Lee's logic should condemn both.\n\nThe early advocates of marijuana prohibition were especially alarmed by marijuana use among racial and ethnic minorities. A 1917 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture described El Paso, Texas, which banned the possession and sale of cannabis in 1914, as \"a hot bed of marihuana fiends,\" who included \"Negroes, prostitutes, pimps and a criminal class of whites\" as well as Mexicans. \"This menacing evil\" and \"malicious vice\" was said to be especially notable \"in the army and among the Negroes.\" The report quoted a police captain who warned that marijuana inspired \"a lust for blood,\" made users \"insensible to pain,\" and imbued them with \"superhuman strength\"-claims that would later be recycled in stories about a wide range of psychoactive substances, including crack cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, and the synthetic cathinones known as \"bath salts.\"\n\nWhen Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger began beating the drum against marijuana in the 1930s, he echoed and amplified the concerns that had already led about 20 states to ban the plant. In a 1934 report to a League of Nations committee, Anslinger wrote that \"fifty percent of the violent crimes committed in districts occupied by Mexicans, Turks, Filipinos, Greeks, Spaniards, Latin-Americans and Negroes may be traced to the abuse of marihuana.\"\n\nAnslinger kept a file of stories that reflected his anxieties about drug-facilitated miscegenation. One such item described \"colored students at the Univ. of Minn.\" who were \"partying with female students (white) smoking and getting their sympathy with stories of racial oppression. Result pregnancy.\"\n\nThe story was similar in the run-up to early bans on opium and cocaine. San Francisco's 1875 ban on opium dens, the first law of its kind in the United States, was of a piece with various policies targeting Chinese immigrants in California, including restrictions on their rights to hunt, fish, own land, and testify in court. The San Francisco Examiner and other newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst warned that Chinese immigrants were using opium to seduce white women. At the national level, similar prejudices produced the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Opium Exclusion Act of 1909, which banned importation and possession of the drug for smoking. Five years later, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act effectively prohibited nonmedical use of opiates.\n\nThat law also banned recreational use of cocaine, which figured in terrifying tales similar to the ones Anslinger would later promote regarding marijuana. In a 1914 New York Times article headlined \"Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are a New Southern Menace,\" the pathologist Edward Huntington Williams averred that \"the cocaine-sniffing negro\" was a \"peculiarly dangerous criminal\" because the drug magnified his \"courage\" and \"resistance to shock,\" making him impervious to ordinary bullets.\n\n\"The most passionate support for legal prohibition of narcotics has been associated with fear of a given drug's effect on a specific minority,\" David F. Musto notes in his classic 1973 drug policy history, The American Disease . \"Certain drugs were dreaded because they seemed to undermine essential social restrictions which kept these groups under control.\"\n\nOver time, the open expression of racism by supporters of drug prohibition became socially and politically unacceptable. But in some cases, the underlying aims were similar.\n\nJohn Ehrlichman, President Richard Nixon's main domestic policy adviser, admitted in a 1994 interview with journalist Dan Baum that his former boss's war on drugs was a way of attacking the administration's political enemies. \"We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black,\" Ehrlichman said. \"But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\"\n\nThe African-American politicians who backed the harsh political response to the \"crack epidemic\" in the 1980s presumably did not share Nixon's views on racial matters, although that era's anxieties about violent crackheads echoed earlier fears of reefer-crazed or cocainized \"Negroes.\" The scientifically baseless decision to treat smokable cocaine as if it were 100 times worse than the snorted kind-a policy President Joe Biden supported as a senator-led to stark racial disparities in the penalties imposed on federal drug offenders, since the vast majority of people charged with possessing or selling crack were black.\n\nModern supporters of the war on weed likewise may be completely free of racial prejudice. Marijuana prohibition nevertheless continues to have a disproportionate impact on African Americans. Nationwide, according to a 2020 report from the American Civil Liberties Union, black people are 3.6 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as white people, even though rates of cannabis consumption in the two groups are similar.\n\nSuch disparities extend beyond crack and marijuana. \"Black and white Americans sell and use drugs at similar rates,\" the Brookings Institution reported in 2016, \"but black Americans are 2.7 times as likely to be arrested for drug-related offenses.\" And \"at the state level, blacks are 6.5 times as likely as whites to be incarcerated for drug-related crimes.\"\n\nProgressive critics of the war on drugs are acutely aware of its bigoted history and ongoing racial disparities, which they emphasize at every opportunity. \"The War on Drugs has been a war on people-particularly people of color,\" says the opening line of a legislative summary that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and two of his colleagues, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), distributed when they unveiled a marijuana legalization bill in July. \"The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act aims to end the decades of harm inflicted on communities of color by removing cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances and empowering states to implement their own cannabis laws.\"\n\nThese same legislators, like nearly all Democratic politicians, seem blind to similar problems with gun control, which they tend to reflexively support. In this respect, Booker-who favors federal gun licensing, a ban on \"assault weapons,\" and a 10-round limit on magazines-is typical of African-American leaders, who are overwhelmingly Democrats and overwhelmingly support new restrictions on firearms. But as Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson shows in his 2014 book Negroes and the Gun , it was not always thus.\n\nJohnson details the long \"black tradition of arms\" in America, beginning with the struggle against slavery and continuing through the murderous racist violence that followed the Civil War, the vicious oppression of the Jim Crow era, and the civil rights movement of the 1940s, '50s, and '60s. Black leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Du Bois, T.R.M. Howard, Roy Wilkins, and Martin Luther King Jr. unambiguously endorsed the right to armed self-defense as a crucial safeguard against the racist aggression that government officials commonly ignored when they were not actively participating in it.\n\nAs a remedy against kidnappers who sought to return people like him to slavery, Douglass recommended \"a good revolver, a steady hand and a determination to shoot down any man attempting to kidnap.\" Wells declared that \"a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home\" and \"should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.\" Even King, the very embodiment of peaceful resistance, relied on firearms for \"that protection.\"\n\nIn 1956, after his home in Birmingham, Alabama, was bombed, King applied for a permit to carry a gun. Despite the potentially deadly threats that King faced as a leader of the Montgomery bus boycott, the county sheriff said no. \"I went to the sheriff to get a permit for those people who are guarding me,\" King told fellow protest organizers. \"In substance, he was saying, 'You are at the disposal of the hoodlums.'\" Several years later, King noted that \"all societies\" accept \"violence exercised merely in self-defense\" as \"moral and legal,\" adding that \"when the Negro uses force in self-defense, he does not forfeit support\" and \"may even win it, by the courage and self-respect it reflects.\"\n\nJohnson notes that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) \"cut its organizational teeth\" defending black people who resisted racist violence with firearms. Most prominently, the organization hired the famous trial lawyer Clarence Darrow to defend Detroit physician Ossian Sweet, who was charged with murder in 1925 after he and his friends used guns against a violent mob bent on evicting him and his family from a white neighborhood.\n\nSweet's victory was the centerpiece of a fundraising campaign that helped establish what is now the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF). The LDF, which grew out of the NAACP's legal department but has operated independently since 1957, won landmark victories against segregation, voting restrictions, and other forms of racial discrimination.\n\nJust as African Americans widely recognized the potentially lifesaving value of firearms, white supremacists understood the threat that armed black people posed to the existing social order. \"The historical record provides compelling evidence that racism underlies gun control laws-and not in any subtle way,\" historian Clayton Cramer noted in a 1995 Kansas Journal of Law and Public Policy article. \"Throughout much of American history, gun control was openly stated as a method for keeping blacks and Hispanics 'in their place,' and to quiet the racial fears of whites.\"\n\nBeginning in the 17th century, when Virginia prohibited black people, whether free or enslaved, from carrying weapons, the colonies and the states they became imposed a series of race-based restrictions on the possession of arms. After the 1831 slave uprising led by Nat Turner, Virginia made it illegal for free blacks to \"keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead.\" Tennessee revised its constitutional guarantee of the right to arms, restricting it to \"free white men.\"\n\nTerrified at the prospect of further insurrections, legislators in Southern states prohibited the transfer of firearms to slaves, limited their use of these otherwise common tools to hunting expressly authorized by their masters, required free blacks to obtain gun licenses, and authorized the seizure of guns found in their homes. \"Overall,\" legal scholars Robert Cottrol and Raymond Diamond observed in a 1991 Georgetown Law Journal article, early gun control laws \"reflected the desire to maintain white supremacy and control.\"\n\nIf \"negroes\" were recognized as citizens, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney warned in the infamous 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford , they would be entitled to all \"the privileges and immunities of citizens,\" including the right to \"keep and carry arms wherever they went.\" After the Civil War, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment aimed to make Taney's nightmare come true. The Civil Rights Act was a direct response to the postbellum Black Codes, which among other things restricted or prohibited gun possession by African Americans. It is likewise apparent from the debate leading up to the 1868 ratification of the 14th Amendment that the right to armed self-defense was one of the \"privileges or immunities\" it guaranteed to \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States.\"\n\nIn practice, however, that right was frequently denied. Eight years after the 14th Amendment was ratified, in United States v. Cruikshank , the Supreme Court held that the federal government had no authority to stop members of terrorist groups like the Ku Klux Klan from disarming black people. It said the remedy for such private aggression lay with state governments.\n\nThose same governments, meanwhile, were passing gun controls that were race-neutral on their face but racist in practice. The measures included bans on inexpensive handguns, which prefigured restrictions that Congress imposed nearly a century later, and discretionary carry permit laws, which resembled contemporary laws, still enforced by several states, that give local officials wide authority to decide who is allowed to bear arms. The latter policy gave police license to deny civil rights leaders like King the right to armed self-defense and to arrest those who dared to arm themselves in defiance of the law.\n\nThe Gun Control Act of 1968, which was largely a response to political assassinations, likewise was not officially aimed at disarming black people. But \"among the act's most significant restrictions,\" Johnson notes, \"were import limits on small, cheap handguns derided as 'Saturday Night Specials'-a label that combined references to cheap little guns dubbed 'Suicide Specials' and the tumult of 'Niggertown Saturday Night.'\"\n\nIn his 1973 book The Saturday Night Special , investigative reporter Robert Sherrill concluded that members of Congress were trying to \"shut off weapons access to blacks.\" Since legislators \"probably associated cheap guns with ghetto blacks and thought cheapness was peculiarly the characteristic of imported military surplus and the mail-order traffic,\" he wrote, \"they decided to cut off these sources while leaving over-the-counter purchases open to the affluent.\"\n\nSimilarly, California's Mulford Act, a 1967 law that banned the open carrying of loaded guns, was a response to armed Black Panther patrols in Oakland that aimed to police the police. The law was supported by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan and the National Rifle Association, later known as staunch defenders of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Gun Control Act of 1968 also described broad categories of Americans who were not allowed to possess firearms, including \"unlawful user[s]\" of controlled substances and people convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than a year, meaning nearly all felonies. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 made those disqualifications enforceable through background checks that federally licensed firearm dealers are required to conduct before completing sales.\n\nJudging from federal survey data, the disqualification for illegal drug users theoretically applies to something like 60 million Americans. That includes people who use controlled substances prescribed for others or use them contrary to their doctor's instructions, along with all cannabis consumers, even if they live in states that have legalized marijuana. The survey data indicate that the rates of illegal drug use among black Americans and white Americans are nearly identical. But because African Americans are especially likely to be arrested for drug possession, they are especially likely to be caught violating this provision of the Gun Control Act if they own firearms.\n\nThe ban on gun possession by people with felony records applies no matter the nature of the crime or when it was committed. It disproportionately affects black men because they are disproportionately likely to have felony records. A 2017 study by University of Georgia sociologist Sarah Shannon found that 33 percent of male African Americans had been convicted of a felony, compared to 8 percent of the general population. In other words, millions of black men have permanently lost their Second Amendment rights, even if their crimes were nonviolent, occurred long ago, or both.\n\nWhen someone who has a felony record is caught with a gun, that is another felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison under federal law. In certain situations, mandatory minimum sentences apply to firearm offenses. When they do, the defendants are mostly black.\n\n18 USC 924(c) prescribes a five-year mandatory minimum for anyone who possesses a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking offense or a crime of violence, whether or not he actually used it. The gun sentence, which must be served in addition to the sentence for the underlying offense, rises to 25 years for each subsequent violation. 18 USC 924(e), also known as the Armed Career Criminal Act, requires a 15-year mandatory minimum for a defendant caught with a gun after three or more convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" According to a 2018 report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, about 53 percent of people sentenced under those two provisions in fiscal year 2016 were black, while 16 percent were white.\n\nRacial disparities also can be seen at the state level. According to FBI data, African Americans, who represent about 14 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 45 percent of arrests for weapon offenses in 2020.\n\nInterracial differences in violent crime rates may account for some portion of these disparities. But that is clearly not the whole story, since even nonviolent drug offenses can make someone subject to arrest and punishment for violating gun laws. In fiscal year 2016, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found, the most common underlying offense triggering penalties under 18 USC 924(c) was drug trafficking, which accounted for 46 percent of cases; other weapon offenses accounted for an additional 8 percent. Furthermore, simply living in a jurisdiction with strict gun controls-which describes many cities with large black populations-makes an arrest for a weapon offense more likely.\n\nIn 2020, an anti-gun initiative in Washington, D.C., generated controversy because of its racially skewed impact. The program encouraged federal prosecution of people with felony records who illegally possessed firearms. Under the D.C. Code, that offense is punishable by at least a year in prison-three years if the original felony was violent. But sentences under federal law tend to be even more severe: nearly five years, on average, even when mandatory minimums don't apply.\n\nD.C.'s felon-in-possession crackdown, which was backed by the District's African-American mayor, Muriel Bowser, was originally advertised as a citywide measure. But in practice, the program focused entirely on three police districts that overlapped with wards that were 64 percent to 92 percent black. By comparison, black people represented 45 percent of the District's total population. D.C. Council Member Charles Allen complained that the program \"targeted District residents of color,\" imposing \"harsh penalties on Black residents whose neighborhoods have historically been underinvested in and overpoliced.\"\n\nThe experience with New York City's \"stop, question, and frisk\" program, which was dramatically scaled back in 2014 after years of complaints that it routinely harassed young black and Latino men for no good reason, shows how gun control hurts racial minorities even when it does not send people to prison. Stop-and-frisk encounters almost never discovered guns-although they sometimes turned up pot, leading to arrests for \"public display\" of marijuana, another example of the malignant interaction between gun control and drug control. Then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire who bankrolls the gun control movement, was untroubled by the dearth of gun seizures. He said the program's aim was to reduce violence by deterring young men from carrying guns.\n\nAlthough he did not seem to realize it, Bloomberg's rationale was inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment, which according to the Supreme Court requires that police reasonably suspect someone is involved in criminal activity before stopping him and reasonably suspect he is armed before frisking him. The fact that pat-downs rarely turned up weapons of any kind suggested that New York cops were frequently flouting that rule. But the assumption that anyone who actually had a firearm would be breaking the law was reasonable given the state's strict gun control regime, which reserves the privilege of bearing arms to people who can demonstrate \"proper cause\"-a standard that cannot be satisfied by asserting a general interest in self-defense.\n\nA case the Supreme Court is considering this term, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen , poses the question of whether the Empire State's carry permit policy is consistent with the constitutional right to bear arms. In a brief arguing that it is not, the Black Attorneys of Legal Aid and several other public defender organizations note that New York's virtual ban on public possession of firearms imposes a special burden on black and Latino residents.\n\n\"Each year,\" the brief says, \"we represent hundreds of indigent people whom New York criminally charges for exercising their right to keep and bear arms. For our clients, New York's licensing requirement renders the Second Amendment a legal fiction. Worse, virtually all our clients whom New York prosecutes for exercising their Second Amendment rights are Black [or] Hispanic.\" That situation, the public defenders say, \"is no accident,\" since \"New York enacted its firearm licensing requirements to criminalize gun ownership by racial and ethnic minorities,\" and \"that remains the effect of its enforcement by police and prosecutors today.\"\n\nThey are referring to the Sullivan Act of 1911, which required a license to own handguns and \"gave local police broad discretion to decide who could obtain one.\" The brief quotes gun policy scholar David Kopel, who describes the Sullivan Act as a response to \"concerns about organized labor, the huge number of immigrants, and race riots in which some blacks defended themselves with firearms.\" The brief notes that the law was enacted after \"years of hysteria over violence that the media and the establishment attributed to racial and ethnic minorities-particularly Black people and Italian immigrants.\"\n\nThe public defenders say the restrictions inspired by such concerns continue to have a \"brutal\" impact on minority groups: \"New York police have stopped, questioned, and frisked our clients on the streets. They have invaded our clients' homes with guns drawn, terrifying them, their families, and their children. They have forcibly removed our clients from their homes and communities and abandoned them in dirty and violent jails and prisons for days, weeks, months, and years. They have deprived our clients of their jobs, children, livelihoods, and ability to live in this country. And they have branded our clients as 'criminals' and 'violent felons' for life. They have done all of this only because our clients exercised a constitutional right.\"\n\nBenjamin Prosser, for example, \"was prosecuted for carrying a gun for self-defense after he was the victim of multiple violent stranger assaults and street robberies.\" Sam Little, \"who had survived a face slashing and lost multiple friends to gun violence, was prosecuted after carrying a gun to defend himself and his young son.\"\n\nShelly Parker and Otis McDonald-African-American plaintiffs who challenged local handgun bans in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, respectively-were animated by similar concerns. Since they could not rely on the government to protect them from violent criminals, they thought, it added insult to injury for the government to prevent them from protecting themselves by keeping handguns in their homes for self-defense. Those cases led to landmark Supreme Court decisions finding such laws inconsistent with the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The question now is whether the Court will extend that logic beyond the home.\n\nIf the Supreme Court does rule against New York's carry permit law, it will be rejecting the position urged by the organization that grew out of a fundraising campaign built on the successful defense of Ossian Sweet and other African Americans who armed themselves against racist aggression. The NAACP LDF, which describes itself as \"the nation's first and foremost civil rights and racial justice organization,\" thinks the Court should uphold New York's law because \"history supports [its] authority to impose public carry restrictions, particularly to protect black people.\"\n\nThe NAACP LDF's brief in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen , which was joined by the National Urban League, says restrictions on public possession of firearms are an \"important tool\" in \"addressing the vexing problem of handgun violence in cities,\" which disproportionately harms African Americans. Ignoring the role that guns in the hands of black people historically played in resisting white supremacist violence, the brief instead emphasizes the danger that guns in the hands of white supremacists posed to black people. It acknowledges that \"past or present-day racial discrimination in the enforcement of gun regulations is a grave and unconstitutional harm.\" But it says the remedy is enforcing the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.\n\nBy contrast, the NAACP decided to support repealing the federal ban on marijuana after concluding that the war on weed discriminates against racial minorities. In 2010, years before the national organization took that position, its California chapter described legalization as a civil rights issue, saying pot prohibition \"has been unfairly applied to our young people of color.\"\n\nThe NAACP LDF's position in the New York gun case exemplifies a shift in thinking that was already underway by the late 1960s. Johnson identifies three reasons mainstream African-American organizations like the NAACP, which had long embraced the black tradition of arms, became full-throated supporters of gun control.\n\nModerate black leaders, who had always tried to maintain a distinction between armed self-defense and political violence, found that the emergence of militant groups like the Black Panthers made drawing that line harder. After \"a strong black political class rose on the wave of a progressive coalition,\" Johnson says, newly empowered African-American leaders tended to take their policy cues from that coalition, which supported tighter restrictions on firearms. And \"as black-on-black violence commanded increasing attention, gun bans promised a solution with the compelling logic of no guns equals no gun crime.\" The upshot was an alliance that seems natural today but looks surprising from a longer historical perspective.\n\nThe NAACP sued gun manufacturers in 1999 for fostering violent crime by \"oversupplying\" firearms-a claim that a federal jury rejected in 2003. Jesse Jackson, who in 1988 became the first black candidate for a major party's presidential nomination to win primary contests, was arrested in 2007 for blocking the entrance to a suburban gun store that he said helped Chicago residents violate the city's handgun ban. Three years later, the Supreme Court overturned that ban, which was similar to a Washington, D.C., law it had deemed unconstitutional in 2008. The NAACP LDF took the government's side in both cases.\n\nAcademics such as Johnson, Cottrol, and Diamond are not the only African-American dissenters from this anti-gun orthodoxy. According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, 24 percent of black adults in the United States owned guns, compared to 36 percent of white adults. More-recent data suggest the gap may be shrinking.\n\nGun sales surged in 2020, a year marked by pandemic-related uncertainty and widespread, sometimes violent protests against police abuse. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), a trade group, reported that an unusually large share of buyers-40 percent in early 2020-were first-time gun owners. According to an NSSF survey of gun dealers, sales to black customers were up 58 percent in the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nDeviation from the anti-gun norm also can be seen on a more organized level. Since 2015, the National African American Gun Association, which has chapters in most states, has sought to \"motivate as many African American men and women [as possible] to go out and purchase a firearm for self-defense and to take training on proper gun use.\" That group and Black Guns Matter, both of which filed briefs urging the Supreme Court to reject New York's carry permit law, argue that armed self-defense has been essential in vindicating African Americans' civil rights.\n\nThe Dallas-based Huey P. Newton Gun Club, founded in 2014, explicitly takes a page from the Black Panthers, responding to police abuse by conspicuously exercising the right to bear arms. \"We are proposing armed self-defense as it relates to the situation with black people here in America when it comes to dealing with police departments,\" the group's founder, Charles Goodson, told Reason 's Zach Weissmueller in 2015. \"We've gotten a lot of response from conservative people, you know, National Rifle Association [members]. We don't consider ourselves to the far right or the far left.\"\n\nBrent Holmes, a Virginia activist who attracted attention by conspicuously carrying guns to Richmond protests against police brutality, likewise thinks it is important for African Americans to assert their Second Amendment rights. \"I believe that I'm channeling my ancestors,\" he told Reason contributor Qinling Li in 2020.\n\nThe Not Fucking Around Coalition (NFAC), a self-described \"black militia\" based in Atlanta, takes a similar approach. The group sent 300 openly armed members to a July 2020 protest in Louisville, Kentucky, that was inspired by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor the previous March.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the in-your-face assertion of Second Amendment rights favored by groups like NFAC, or even the lower-key support for armed self-defense exemplified by the National African American Gun Association, will gain much traction among black politicians. To the contrary, most of them are bent on imposing new firearm restrictions that would expand the opportunities to lock up members of their community.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee's 2021 bill, which would establish a federal system to license gun owners and register their firearms, prescribes severe minimum penalties for anyone who violates its requirements. That's a striking departure from Jackson Lee's support for sentencing reform and her criticism of a criminal justice system that is \"often more effective at creating criminals and collateral damage than actual justice.\"\n\nJackson Lee's registration requirement applies to currently owned firearms as well as guns purchased after the bill takes effect. The bill would give current owners three months to report \"the make, model, and serial number of the firearm, the identity of the owner of the firearm, the date the firearm was acquired by the owner, and where the firearm is or will be stored,\" along with \"the identity of any person to whom, and any period of time during which, the firearm will be loaned to the person.\" New buyers would have to report that information on the date of purchase. Failure to comply would be punishable by a minimum fine of $75,000, a minimum prison sentence of 15 years, or both.\n\nUnder Jackson Lee's bill, every gun owner would have to obtain a federal license, limited to people 21 or older who pass a criminal background check, undergo a \"psychological examination,\" complete at least 24 hours of training, and pay an $800 \"fee\" for liability insurance. The bill would expand the already overbroad federal criteria that disqualify people from gun ownership to encompass anyone who was ever treated in a hospital (even voluntarily) for a \"brain disease\" or a \"mental illness.\" It also would authorize denial of a license to anyone who \"has a chronic mental illness or disturbance, or a brain disease,\" is addicted to alcohol or illegal drugs, has attempted suicide, or has \"engaged in conduct that posed a danger to self or others,\" as determined by \"prior psychological treatment or evaluation.\"\n\nIf an applicant did not survive this gauntlet, it would be a felony for him to possess a firearm, punishable by the same fine and prison sentence as failure to register the weapon. That applies to current owners as well as new buyers. People who have been licensed for less than five years would have to renew their licenses every year; people who have been licensed five years or longer would be eligible for three-year licenses. If a gun owner neglected to renew his license, he would be subject to the same penalties as someone who never got one.\n\nThe system Jackson Lee imagines is completely impractical, since gun owners would be understandably reluctant to identify themselves and their firearms so they could be entered in a federal database and required to apply for licenses. Politicians pursuing far less ambitious gun registration schemes have found that voluntary compliance is the exception rather than the rule. Since the Justice Department would not have the resources to go after millions of recalcitrant gun owners even if it knew who they were, the result would be arbitrary application of Jackson Lee's draconian penalties to the few who happened to attract the government's attention.\n\nWho would those people tend to be? As a legislator who decries racial bias in policing, Jackson Lee ought to know.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) described a handful of protesters carrying guns in public as \"mob rule.\"\n\nIs Loeffler the rare conservative politician with a history of calling for expanded gun controls? That doesn't appear the case. Here's a tweet from her from January expressing appreciation for National Rifle Association President Carolyn Meadows:\n\nGreat to be back in Atlanta with @NRA President and fellow Georgian, Carolyn Meadows. Truly appreciate her work in Washington and around the country to protect and defend our 2nd Amendment Rights. #gapol pic.twitter.com/CAWS9FbEUk\n\n- Senator Kelly Loeffler (@SenatorLoeffler) January 17, 2020\n\nWhat could possibly make a pro-gun-rights senator suddenly take such a dim view of citizens' rights to bear arms? Watch this Wednesday segment from the Fox show America's Newsroom , and the answer becomes apparent pretty quickly:\n\nJoined @edhenry on @AmericaNewsroom to discuss my efforts to end the defund the police movement & pass the #JusticeAct . Enough with the political games from Democrats in Washington. Americans deserve better. #gapol #gasen pic.twitter.com/uopR5jiJHU\n\n- Kelly Loeffler (@KLoeffler) June 24, 2020\n\nAs you can see, Fox interviewed Loeffler amid a montage of young, armed black people protesting police abuse in Atlanta, where a cop recently shot and killed Rayshard Brooks . Another Fox host, Sean Hannity, reported on Tuesday that there were \"at least three men brandishing long guns\" near the Wendy's where the incident happened.\n\nHannity, Fox, and Loeffler all represented this as evidence of the dangers of defunding police. Indeed, one young man with a gun (who seemed perfectly polite and respectful) told Fox he was carrying a 12-gauge shotgun because he didn't believe police officers would protect him, adding that cops were not going to be \"allowed\" in this space. Asked what he'd do if police rolled up and ordered him to drop his weapon, the man insisted he had the legal right under the Second Amendment of the Constitution to bear arms: \"And at no point will I allow my right to be disturbed.\" Good for him!\n\nCarrying long guns in public is legal in Georgia , by the way (with exceptions for a few places like courts and schools). Fox does not actually accuse any of these men of breaking any laws. But they clearly intend viewers to see these men as a threat-and not just because they have put up barricades and hope to shut out the police, but because they're bearing arms. By contrast, when a predominantly white group of protesters showed up at Michigan's capitol in April to protest the state's COVID-19 rules, Fox's coverage was reasonably neutral and factual, giving voice to critics but pointing out that guns were legally allowed in the state Capitol building.\n\nLoeffler isn't just a hypocrite about gun rights. She's trying to undermine another value conservatives are supposed to believe in: federalism. The senator is introducing legislation that would reduce federal transportation funding from states and municipalities that cut funding to law enforcement, unless they can show a \" clear budgetary need .\" The idea that the states and cities should have to get permission from the U.S. government to make a budget decision is, of course, absolutely anathema to local rule. It's up to a community's citizens to determine how much money their police department should receive-not the U.S. Senate or the Department of Transportation.\n\nBonus video: ReasonTV on the importance of defending open carry rights in black communities to defend civil rights:\n\nStart your day with Reason .

NFAC previously gathered in the Georgia neighborhood where Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed by two white residents while unarmed and out jogging.\n\nIn a clip from one of his livestreamed discussions, The Official Grand Master Jay touted the power of armed protests by speaking about an encounter with officers that ended peacefully.\n\nOther armed protesters have recently made headlines for defending their beliefs.

Several in the group carried rifles as they walked her safely to the building.\n\nThe arrival of militia members and armed private citizens is to be expected in cities where there is intense fallout from fatal use-of-force incidents.

      "text": "Black Dignity Matters\n\nPolice\n\nRonald Bailey | 7.15.2016 1:30 PM\n\nRace and policing preoccupied Americans last week. The two shootings by police of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota rightly sparked outrage and protest across the country. Then came the racially motivated attack that killed five police officers during a Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas.\n\nTensions between police and the African-American community were already high. For example, a June Gallup Poll reported that 67 percent of blacks believe that police treat African Americans less fairly than whites in their community.\n\nIs there any evidence of such biased policing? Unfortunately, yes.\n\nIn a new study, \" Targeting young men of color by search and arrest during traffic stops ,\" by the University of North Carolina political scientist Frank Baumgartner and his colleagues find clear evidence of extensive police racial profiling. The researchers reached their conclusions by parsing data encompassing more than 18 million traffic stops in North Carolina between 2002 and 2013.\n\nNorth Carolina was the first state in the nation to mandate police-stop data collection, and since 2002 the North Carolina Department of Justice has gathered information on every traffic stop from law-enforcement agencies throughout the state. The police can assign reasons for a traffic stop to 10 different categories-speeding, safe movement, equipment issues, not having a seat belt buckled, expired registration tags, and so on. In general, the researchers report that while blacks constitute about 22 percent of North Carolina's population, 31 percent of stopped motorists are black. Whites and blacks are about equally likely to receive citations (tickets) for traffic infractions.\n\nThe difference in police treatment becomes apparent when looking at search and arrest statistics. Except in the case of driving while drunk, black motorists are much more likely to be searched or arrested than are white motorists.\n\nFor all nine categories of traffic stops (checkpoint stops are excluded) considered in the study, 2.61 percent of white drivers are searched, whereas 4.57 percent of black drivers are. In other words, black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be searched than white ones. Similarly, 1.9 percent of whites are arrested, compared to 2.71 percent of blacks-so blacks are 43 percent more likely to be arrested than white ones. And worse yet, the search disparities for black versus white drivers have been growing over time. In 2002, black men were 70 percent more likely to be searched than white men. By 2007, black men were twice as likely to be searched; by 2013, this difference had grown to over 140 percent. The percent difference in the likelihood of arrest between black and white male drivers remained stable at about 60 percent. Interestingly, black and white women of whatever age were about equally likely to be searched, cited, or arrested during traffic stops.\n\nThe researchers suggest that there are two possible explanations for the disparities they document: racially differential policing or racially differential possession of contraband. Since searches subject to warrants and incident to arrests are procedurally mandatory, the researchers look chiefly at searches done with consent or based on probable cause. They report that black men are twice as likely as white men to be searched with consent. This suggests that black men are either more willing to give their consent to being searched or that they are asked more often for such consent. In addition, \"Probable cause searches skew strongly toward blacks, indicating that officers are much more likely to be suspicious of criminal wrongdoing when interacting with black motorists.\"\n\nBy one definition , probable cause means reasonably reliable information to suspect there is a fair probability that a person has committed a crime, or that a search will reveal contraband or evidence. So how much more suspicious of black male motorists are North Carolina police? Based on probable cause, officers were 125 percent more likely to search black men than white men in 2002. That differential had increased to 250 percent by 2013, despite the fact that police consistently have been more likely to find contraband with white males than with black males. Similar results were found with regard to consent searches of white and black males.\n\n\"So the increased reliance on probable cause to search blacks is not associated with more accurate assessments of the likelihood of blacks engaging in criminal behavior,\" the researchers write. They add, \"The data make clear that with regard to consent and probable cause searches, an increased targeting of black males was completely unjustified by any corresponding increase in contraband hit rates.\" In other words, the greatly increased number of police searches of black male motorists has not resulted in finding any more drugs, illicit guns, or stolen property.\n\nThe idea that police tend to treat black Americans more harshly than white Americans was further bolstered by a new study by the Harvard economist Roland Fryer, Jr., that assesses racial differences in police use of force . Fryer analyzed what happened after black, white, and Hispanic citizens were stopped by police in ten cities. Fryer reports that with regard to non-lethal uses of force, such as being grabbed, pushed into a wall or onto the ground, or handcuffed, \"blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police than whites.\" There was one notable exception to this pattern: Despite the vivid stream of video testimony of police shootings of black men, \"blacks are 23.8 percent less likely to be shot by police, relative to whites.\"\n\nIn any case, the North Carolina and Harvard studies strongly indicate that police do subject African Americans to greater unwarranted scrutiny and harsher treatment. \"We can conclude that blacks in North Carolina appear to have good reasons to be mistrustful of the police, and that these trends appear to be growing over time,\" the North Carolina researchers warn.\n\nFryer suggests that unwarranted police encounters demoralize members of minority communities and could contribute to sustaining aspects of racial inequality. \"If, for instance, blacks use their lived experience with police as evidence that the world is discriminatory,\" speculates Fryer, \"then it is easy to understand why black youth invest less in human capital or black adults are more likely to believe discrimination is an important determinant of economic outcomes.\" He concludes, \"Black Dignity Matters.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Patrick Ruffini: Why Blacks and Hispanics Are Turning to Trump\n\nElection 2024\n\nNick Gillespie | 3.13.2024 11:05 AM\n\nHD Video Download\n\nDid you know that a mere 44,000 votes spread across Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin kept Joe Biden and Donald Trump from an Electoral College tie in 2020? That was even tighter than in 2016, when 80,000 votes in three states gave Trump a decisive Electoral College win.\n\nPatrick Ruffini is a Republican pollster at Echelon Insights and author of Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP . Reason 's Nick Gillespie talked with Ruffini about why the major parties continue to leak market share , why 2024 is going to be another super-close presidential race, and whether small- l libertarian voters will make the difference in November.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for style and clarity.\n\nNick Gillespie: What's the elevator pitch for your book, Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP ?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: I think that it's no secret to anyone that there have been quite a few changes in our politics over the last decade or so. Specifically, a lot of those involve changes in who's voting for the parties and, fundamentally, who the parties are for. What do they seem to stand for? I go back to my early days in politics, which were at the tail end of an era in which Democrats were primarily pitching themselves to voters and receiving the votes of people who were in the working class. They really seemed to hold the moral high ground when it came to issues of who's really going to care about someone like me, an average person in this country. And [Democrats] would routinely pillory Republicans as the party of the rich, as the party of the well-to-do, the disconnected elite.\n\nI think what we've seen is that has largely flipped. Specifically, it flipped after 2016, when Democrats really seemed to [begin to] have a lot of trouble holding on to the broad mass of working-class voters, which are today defined as voters without college degrees. Sixty-four percent of voters do not have college degrees. We obviously saw in 2016 how they lost some of those blue wall states-Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin-largely because Trump was able to appeal to this electorate in a way that no Republican had before and flipped states that no Republican had won since 1988.\n\nGillespie: Early on in the book, you write, \"I had egg on my face in 2016.\" Can you talk a little bit about why you had egg on your face? Of course, it wasn't just you. It's virtually all pollsters, strategists, and activists.\n\nRuffini: The presumption, I think, heading into the 2016 election was that Trump was a sure loser in the election. If not in the Republican primary, then he's a sure loser in the general election. There is always a question of, \"Will he succeed in this hostile takeover of the Republican Party?\" Initially, I was skeptical, but not long after, it was very clear he was the odds-on favorite because he had really captured a large chunk of the electorate. Everyone else was squabbling for scraps at the table. Even if only at 35 percent, no one else was higher than 10 percent, practically speaking, at the time. But the idea was [that] maybe he can win the Republican nomination, but he's a sure loser in the general election based on just his off-color commentary, his unhinged rally speeches. Everything that was really conventional wisdom among political observers in 2016 [pointed to] a Trump victory-a victory of somebody who just flouted political norms as he did-being flat out unthinkable.\n\nI was part of that conventional wisdom. Hillary Clinton seemed to be doing herself no favors. I didn't completely discount that. A lesson that I learned after that is voters also don't really care about the integrity of political norms as a whole. There are some segments of voters that absolutely deeply care about them. But in terms of the center of the electorate, I don't think most voters are saying, \"Oh, politics is this noble thing that Donald Trump is degrading.\" I think they see politics as something that's down and dirty, dishonest, corrupt in large measure. Lots of people see it that way.\n\nGillespie: It's an interesting kind of issue, because one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton was so vulnerable was because she was seen as almost uniquely corrupt and in bed with all sorts of bad interests.\n\nRuffini: The idea is that for people like me who work in politics, and particularly for a political class, that are just trying to see the people we work with as basically well-intentioned people who are trying to make a positive difference for the country-it turns out just very few people actually see it that way. And Hillary Clinton was absolutely somebody who was painted that way.\n\nI write about the parallels between Trump and Bill Clinton. Because Bill Clinton too was kind of viewed as this unsavory, seedy type of figure during his campaigns and his presidency. He was Slick Willy. He could get away with anything. In the same way, Trump was somebody who maybe had disreputable things, both that he had said and that he had done in his past, and he always seemed to evade accountability. I think that there's something to the idea that you can succeed in this environment if people view you as sort of being authentically that rascally, scoundrel-like figure who is in some way honest with voters about what they're getting. It's when you've got people who are trying to portray themselves as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and then don't live up to that image, that they get in trouble.\n\nGillespie: Trump, the billionaire who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and was a TV star, was talking about the forgotten man. He spoke for the forgotten man. Whereas Biden-who is not working class - talked about [the working class] incessantly and coming from Scranton, Pennsylvania, etc. He's dumped a ton of money into the country, but that doesn't seem to be resonating with voters, does it?\n\nRuffini: I think it's ultimately who does the working class identify with? Somebody who is not fundamentally a creature of Washington, D.C., and not fundamentally a creature of this dirty, unsavory political game-I think that's what they saw in Trump. They saw a certain authenticity, and they saw somebody who spoke like them, somebody who was angry at the same people that they were angry at. I think that carried the day, ultimately.\n\nGillespie: It's worth pointing out that he squeaked into office with a historically low popular vote. Clinton in '92 got in with a smaller amount, and about the same amount or a little bit more in '96.\n\nI want to zero in on what working class means. Biden carried voters who made less than $50,000. He carried households making between $50,000 to $100,000. Trump took those making over $100,000. What you say in the book is that the key divide is education, and maybe also geography, instead of economic class. It's socioeconomic status or education level. How is that functioning differently than just the amount of money that a household is bringing it?\n\nRuffini: It's true that at some level, the amount of money that you have in your bank account does actually dictate a lot about the way you view the world. There may still be some truth to that.\n\nBut the point I'm making is that, in terms of what manifests politically and what we're seeing happen politically in the country, education is by far the better variable that predicts everything that's happened, and particularly what's happened among white voters. So I put in the book the caveat that non-white voters don't necessarily act the same way in terms of there not being a class divide. There's more of a different pattern of behavior.\n\nGillespie: What percentage of the electorate is white? Is it still a vast majority?\n\nRuffini: In 2024, it's mid-70 percent.\n\nGillespie: So votes by white Americans are going to comprise the vast majority of ballots cast.\n\nRuffini: I would say whatever 70 percent is, if it's the vast majority, but it's still a pretty strong majority. But increasingly that white vote does not really behave as a unit, does not really matter in terms of anything politically. You're really talking about white voters without a college degree and white voters with a college degree, that used to be back in the '90s very similar in how they voted. You could kind of talk about there being a \"white vote\" in the 1990s. Today, you can't talk about it that way. The 40 percent of voters are going to be white non-college and the 30 percent of voters who are going to be white with a college degree. Those used to vote very similarly, and are [now] 40 points apart on the margin in who they're voting for.\n\nGillespie: Then you talk about the distinction between cosmopolitans and traditionalists. What does that mean?\n\nRuffini: It maps pretty cleanly onto this idea of white college, white non-college. I'm really interested in where things are moving. Because even though, as you cited some statistics, Biden is still winning some of those lower income voters, but what's happening there is that you still have quite a few low income minority voters in that pool of people. So Biden wins. But that gap between sort of the low income and high income voters, it is nowhere near where it was in 1996, 2000-it's just a completely different ballgame there.\n\nWhen I say that, it means, who is a group of voters that is uniquely motivated by these sort of more abstract ideals of protecting democratic norms? Those are the same groups of voters, who live in cities, embrace ideas about diversity, are just generally more progressive or liberal in their outlook, but are uniquely motivated by these questions of social equality.\n\nThen you've got a large group of voters that are not motivated by those issues. They're either motivated on the other side by a more traditional cosmopolitan view. But when it comes to some of these minority voter communities that still vote Democratic, what you find is, they are very much the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in terms of their views on social issues. They don't really place any sort of prioritization on these animating issues behind the Democratic coalition today on this Dobbs [v. Jackson Women's Health Organization] and Democracy message. Their allegiance to the Democratic Party is more historic. It was rooted in this identity of the Democratic Party as the party of the working class, of the marginalized minority communities.\n\nGillespie: So as the faces of the Democratic Party become more of a multiracial coalition or a rainbow coalition, they are actually losing touch with the very people they claim to be representing more directly?\n\nRuffini: In the revealed preferences of voters, what you actually don't find is either Hispanic or Latino voters being motivated by identity politics. In 2016, you had Trump throw every insult in the book at Mexicans, saying they're rapists, bringing crime, drugs over the border. He didn't really seem to lose a whole lot of Latino support. I mean, you would think he would. Similarly, you had Trump after the [Black Lives Matter] protests in 2020 sort of behaving badly in that context, saying that police should shoot looters and all those things. He gained support among black voters in 2020. The revealed preferences of these voters are not that they are uniquely motivated by this kind of racial identity rhetoric that is coming from the left.\n\nGillespie: How much of the swing from Democrats to Republicans is Trump appealing to people? How much of it is Democrats not addressing people whose votes they're taking for granted?\n\nRuffini: Absolutely, you can't write Donald Trump out of the story completely. You have a catalyst for the shifts we've seen. It appears that he's obviously very, very highly likely to be the Republican nominee. When you look at polling for 2024, we're seeing a further shift of African-American and Latino voters in his direction. In fact, that's most of the gains that he's been getting in the polls. To the extent that those partly materialize in 2024, what I think we're going to see is this realignment that he helped bring into being. The question is what happens if and when Donald Trump fades from the scene, and whether or not we believe we will see some sort of return to the old coalition line, to a more Romney 2012-style coalition.\n\nThe entire history of our politics suggests that that's not going to happen. I think you'll see some mean reversion. I think if Nikki Haley were the nominee - very unlikely to happen - you'd certainly see her do better in the suburbs. You'd probably see her frankly do better overall in the election. Not quite as polarizing a figure, but I don't think you would ever see a return back. And there's a good reason for that. That's because this kind of thing is happening throughout Western democracies, where the working class sort of is aligning itself more and more with the parties of the right. The more highly educated voters are aligning themselves more and more with parties on the left. Those countries don't necessarily have a Donald Trump. But this does seem to be something that is naturally occurring - was to some extent occurring before Donald Trump. So I don't think it's exclusively on him, but he was a catalyst for accelerating.\n\nGillespie: Is any of this generational in nature? Overwhelmingly younger people voted for Democrats, at least in presidential elections.\n\nRuffini: This is a big issue. This is a big debate right now. Are you actually going to see people as they grow older becoming more conservative? That's what we've seen in generations past. But there's a lot of discussion that millennials aren't quite following that same trajectory. Partly the big generational divide that I really talk about is that we now have an electorate that is entirely passed through the education sorting machine, in terms of when they were coming up and they were young, they had the opportunity to go to college or not go to college, and that was a legitimate choice, as opposed to maybe for those in the silent generation where most people just didn't go to college.\n\nAs a result, you've just got much more education polarization because more people have made the decision. If you have made that decision, \"Yeah, I'm going to leave my hometown and kind of not pursue knowledge and, maybe move to a big city after college and really be part of this knowledge economy,\" that's just fundamentally a different kind of person than the person who stays closer to the people in places they knew growing up. I think that's part of the generational story.\n\nI also think the generational story can't be separated from the question of race, because you just have a younger generation that is much, much more diverse. The silent generation and boomers are just much more white. You actually do see that they are more liberal and traditionally have been much more liberal as a result in the younger generation. But it's really a function of race, I think that that's true. I write about the ways that's changing.\n\nI don't really tackle this question of generations directly because I do think it's downstream of race. I think that to the extent that younger Hispanics are not tied to the voting patterns of their parents, younger African Americans are not tied to the same voting patterns of their parents - what you're actually going to see is more of them voting Republican. You see it as a whole, diverse, younger generation that is going to be more politically balanced.\n\nGillespie: You point out the fact that the country is more mixed than ever. There is a huge amount of what would count by various measures as desegregation going on-younger generations, millennials, and Gen-Z are more multi-ethnic. How do you consider yourself, if let's say, you're a third-generation Puerto Rican who married an Asian woman, then you divorce them and marry a black person? What are your kids? I think we're seeing an attempt to kind of keep two or three categories intact when the social reality is just vastly outstripping that.\n\nRuffini: As of today, the number of voters who are genuinely more than one race-it's actually a pretty small number. But when you look at the children born in the United States, one in five children being born today are of some kind of mixed racial background, and that doesn't even count Hispanics, because we don't have a really good way of actually accounting for Hispanics because of the way the census collects data.\n\nI do think that this assumption we've had about non-white groups being a loyal Democratic bloc, especially within the African-American community, was predicated on the idea that this was a marginalized, discriminated-against group that needed to organize under the banner of one political party to advance their interests. What happens when that identity is no longer salient? That identity of, \"I don't view myself as a victim.\" I don't view myself as somebody who is going to be discriminated against as a result of my skin color, and that's just fundamentally not who I am. I am many different things. I am potentially of many different races. But I also live in a suburb with people of all different sorts of racial and ethnic backgrounds. I think that's fundamentally, in one way or the other, just going to change voting patterns over time.\n\nGillespie: The idea that Trump actually was getting more minority votes than somebody like a Mitt Romney or a John McCain...What was the swing in black support for Trump? It's still low, even historically going back to somebody like [Dwight D.] Eisenhower. But what's the swing? What are the issues that black voters-if we can talk about a median black vote-care about?\n\nRuffini: There's different data sources on this. If you look at precinct data, there's something like a 5 to 6 point swing on the margin from a very low base. But that means in some cases, you had precincts where there were literally zero voters and they go to, all right, maybe Trump gets five voters or ten voters in 2016 or 2020.\n\nGillespie: But he did particularly well among black men, right?\n\nRuffini: Yeah. In general, you've seen a little bit of recovery and some other data sources have it as much as 10 or 12 points among black voters, from 2016 to 2020, when you had a swing of about 18 points among Hispanic voters. So you're right. That was something that kind of blew my mind too early on. But when you kind of start to see that this is actually part of the same trend of white working class voters. The vast majority of Hispanic and African-American people in this country are working class in terms of not having a college degree. It's a part of the working class shift more broadly, even as college educated shifted to Democrats, the non-college educated are shifting Republican. I do think that that has been the shift.\n\nI think that particularly Trump-a lot of it goes back to his personal demeanor, which I think if you talk to people along the coast, people like us would say that's a liability. But it turns out that's not a liability to a lot of people in the country. In fact, it's something that attracts a lot of people to him, including some unexpected voters. So when it comes to, again, these younger minority men, who I think are a key group, kind of heading into this election cycle, who themselves speak pretty bluntly and forthrightly , this idea of somebody who does not necessarily adhere to the genteel mannerisms of political discourse is, on balance, more appealing than somebody who does.\n\nGillespie: If Trump's appeal to blacks is growing and that's partly powered by an appeal to non-college-educated black men who like blunt speaking, what is it with Hispanics?\n\nRuffini: I think number one, it's the economy. This is an upwardly mobile, striving community. It's a community where that old historic pattern of if you have more money, if you've made it in the country, you actually are voting more Republican. It just turns out there's a pretty good upward trajectory and upward trend in Hispanic incomes over the last few generations. You actually do see a lot more loyalty to the Democratic Party in the sort of lower income first generation communities that you see moved to second and third generation communities.\n\nGillespie: As you point out in your book, your name ends in a vowel. It is Italian. I am Italian on my mother's side, who grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut, not far from where you grew up. Michael Barone, 25 years ago wrote The New Americans: How the Melting Pot Can Work Again, and likened the Mexican-American experience to the Italian-American experience. Part of his argument was that two or three generations in, they are indistinguishable from native-born people.\n\nYet we fail to grasp that because Latino or Hispanic immigrants keep coming to the country. We keep thinking everybody is here for six months or a couple of years. And we don't recognize that since Reagan's second administration, if not longer, Latinos, particularly Mexicans, have been here, and now they're in their second or third generation. So they're really as American as Italians, right?\n\nRuffini: That's right. I think there's a big divide by generation in terms of partisanship. But you mentioned that the group is not a monolith. There's no shared unique experience among Latinos in America. You've got Mexican Americans, got Puerto Ricans, got Cuban Americans. All the different [groups] came from incredibly different contexts. When you look at the issue of why does Trump actually make gains after he elevates the issue of immigration? It's because Hispanics who are already in the voting public, do they see the people coming across the border today as people like them or do they see them as fundamentally different from them? I think they see them as more different than they do similar. If you're voting and if you show up in these election statistics that I talk about, you've probably been here for a while. You're a citizen of the United States. You are a legal immigrant to the United States, if you have immigrated at all to the United States. It's just a fundamentally different experience.\n\nIn particular in the polling, in the work I've done on the southern border, it's very clear that the people down there do not see the people crossing as being one of them, especially in the current wave. What you see also increasingly is, the people here in those communities tend to be more Mexican-American. And what you see is people from Venezuela, but you're also seeing non-Latino people crossing. You're seeing people from Haiti, the Caribbean and further afield, who are part of this migrant crisis. It's just fundamentally different. A typical Latino voter is as far apart from the people crossing today than a typical white. And that's the reality.\n\nGillespie: Has immigration been defined by the chaos at the border or the inability to control the border?\n\nRuffini: There is no question that this situation on the southern border has overshadowed and dominated the whole question of immigration, such that when you even bring up the question of immigration in this survey, people see it as an issue that is a liability for the Biden administration. People want to go back to something like the Trump administration policies. But you did see increasingly, post-2016, there was a backlash among Democrats to what was seen as Trump's xenophobia, intolerance of immigrants, and so they, as a result, putting on their jerseys to some extent, decided to be a party that was openly advocating for immigration, whereas you wouldn't have seen that in the Democratic Party of yesteryear, which was where labor was a big factor. Labor, in and of itself through the 1990s, was very skeptical of open immigration.\n\nI think that the old populist Democratic Party went away. As a result, Biden had to commit to a much more open set of border policies that has invited political disaster for him.\n\nGillespie: At the same time, Bill Clinton in '96 spent a huge chunk of his renomination speech saying he was going to get rid of illegal immigrants. He was going to remove them from the country.\n\nRuffini: That is a really good point. I think there's a world of difference between Bill Clinton and what Joe Biden is going to do. You don't really see Biden touting the fact that he is now tough on the border, like he is the one who was tough and wants to get something done on the border, in such a way that it would register with voters.\n\nThe other day on Twitter, I imagined, what would a Bill Clinton-style ad look like about the current border crisis? I know he'd be talking about the Biden border plan to crack down on illegals. If you were rerunning the Bill Clinton 1996 playbook, which, by the way, I think that would work, I think that would still work today. But you won't see him do it because the climate within his own party has just dramatically changed when it comes to anything that's adjacent to diversity or anything like that. It's just unimaginable that he would do something like that.\n\nGillespie: Let's talk about Asian Americans. How do they factor into the multiracial coalition that might remake the GOP? How bad is it to characterize all Asian Americans as peas in a pod? But then what is the highest-salience set of issues for them?\n\nRuffini: This is a very bifurcated community because about half of the Asian electorate is college-educated and votes in many ways similar to the white, college-educated electorate. You have a large number of Asians in California, which is a very blue state. They started out from a very democratic baseline. But if you look at the Asian American professionals in one of the major metro areas, they're pretty indistinguishable, actually, from a white educated professional.\n\nIn terms of the places where you have an identifiably Asian voting bloc-places like Little Saigon in Orange County or in San Jose, California, or places in Queens, which have received a lot of attention over the last couple election cycles-those are oftentimes first generation immigrant communities where a lot of people speak the original language. These voters are very different from this professional class that you've seen a shift in? You actually start to see more of a class divide in the Asian community.\n\nBut you look at places like in New York City-and particularly this realignment kind of gained steam in 2022-[former Rep.] Lee Zeldin [R-N.Y.] won a lot of those voters. You had three Asian American Republicans getting elected as Assembly people in Brooklyn, when no one was really expecting that. It is a very different community. You really see it particularly among Koreans, among Vietnamese, to some extent Chinese Americans. Less so among Indian Americans, I don't think you see it as much there. But there's a huge divide by education.\n\nGillespie: What about groups like Chinese and Japanese, who might be a very small population? Do you see the same kind of pattern where if they've been here for three generations or more they have become indistinguishable from white voters or native-born Americans?\n\nRuffini: It depends on the context of what are they moving to. To some extent, the Hispanic working-class voter is essentially this generation's version of the white working-class voter of yesteryear. They're moving into places like Northeast Philly, which was a traditionally more conservative place. We had a pretty conservative white electorate. But they're living a solidly middle-class existence. This is not like, \"Oh, we're living in the barrio.\" We are living a solidly middle-class existence. There's a pathway where you can see how they're becoming more Republican.\n\nLook at the Asian American voter. It's a little bit more complicated because you mentioned The New Americans by Michael Barone, where he drew these parallels. The parallel he draws with Asians, is if Hispanics were the new Italians, Asians are the new Jews, in terms of they seem to be a very highly educated group, with very high levels of educational attainment, very high levels of rising up the income ladder, almost in a very steep pattern where they're leapfrogging every other group. There is a sense that that has led to a more Democratic outlook among a newer generation or people entering the professional class. You see that more and more among Asian voters.\n\nBut to some extent, the Democratic Party has spurned the Asian American vote. The progressive movement has spurned the Asian-American voter in the push for diversity, ironically, in higher education, where it's really Asian-Americans who are the losers. If you de-emphasized merit in higher education-I'd love to see your Republicans actually do more to seize upon that issue in Asian communities.\n\nGillespie: We all know that the 2016 election was unbelievably close. It was as tight as it could get. But in 2020, Joe Biden won overwhelmingly in the popular vote as a percentage and in the Electoral College. But how close was that election? Was it a blowout, or was it actually pretty close to 2016 when you factor in things?\n\nRuffini: I'm smiling because actually the perception that it wasn't a close election, it's just completely wrong. It's actually, technically speaking, closer than 2016 when you look at the number of votes needed to have flipped in the Electoral College. People forget how close Trump came to winning the election-just a shift of 0.7 percent in the popular vote spread uniformly across the country would have won. That means he would have been the president, squeaking by with 6 million fewer popular votes than Biden. Why is that? Partly it's due to this working-class coalition.\n\nThe working class is concentrated in states that are more just electorally significant to the outcome of the election. Part of the reason that this realignment really is the best avenue and bet for Republicans to win elections moving forward is because they're overrepresented in the electoral college. Now, we'll see if that happens again in 2024. But, it was a very, very close election, and particularly compared to the polls going into the election, which Biden I think was up by eight points in the last polling average. He only wins by four and barely squeaks by in a way that allows Trump to make an argument to his voters that it was stolen from him.\n\nGillespie: Do you believe that or are you saying that Trump made that argument?\n\nRuffini: No, I don't believe it was stolen from him. But I do think that had we seen Biden actually win the election by as much as he should have won the election, as much as polls were saying, and was expected to win the election, then I think Trump would have just had a much harder time convincing people.\n\nGillespie: Assuming the 2024 election is Trump vs. Biden and assuming each of them is brain damaged in their own unique, special ways, is it totally up for grabs?\n\nRuffini: I think that it would be. It's a fair assumption about any election, no matter what the polls say at this point. You start from the prior that it's a jump ball. But, it's a very different election right now. Right now, Trump is polling ahead and that's been very consistent, no matter what the economic numbers seem to do. I don't think you could ignore that. It's not a fundamentally different election from the standpoint of pre-election polling than it was in 2020. That said, I think we will likely still see a very, very close election. But, right now, Trump seems to be doing a lot better than he was at this point in 2020.\n\nGillespie: The economy compared to 2020 is doing relatively well. Inflation was a big issue then. Despite Biden being terrible on the economy, things for most people are doing pretty well. Is that because voters don't really care about the actual reality?\n\nRuffini: I wouldn't say the results are reality and the ground doesn't matter. If the economic situation kind of quiets down, he'd rather have that than the alternative. But a perception has set in particularly as it relates to Biden's fitness and his age that is very hard to recover from, unless something dramatic happens, either in the form of a Trump conviction or in the form of Trump has his own health crisis, that does seem to be something that is weighing down Biden pretty heavily, independently of the state of the economy. But also just a pretty deep-seated perception that the grass was greener on the other side of the street.\n\nEven if Biden is able to somehow recover on the economy, and maybe make it a little bit more of a draw, does he still win the debate with Trump over who best is able to manage the economy? They still win that retrospective look back, I was better off. The perception that set in, that things were at least under control on the global stage when Trump was president, I seem to be making more money.\n\nGillespie: Towards the end of your book Party of the People , you say, \"I come to tell the younger me that the libertarian dream of smaller government is debt.\" You also talk a fair amount when you're looking at the future of politics about a quadrant chart that Lee Trotman put together, which shows that what used to be called the libertarian quadrant - the shorthand is fiscally conservative, socially liberal - there are no voters there. How do you justify that?\n\nRuffini: That's something your colleague Stephanie Slade tackled very aptly in a feature piece at Reason recently. Growing up, I very much drank the Kool-Aid, supply-side economics and a lot of, not just maybe a more libertarian economics, but the whole Reagan view of, let's say, limited government. The reality is that not a lot of voters are motivated by those sorts of questions in the real world. You see both parties increasingly motivated on cultural questions and activated on cultural questions. That's particularly true of Republican voters, and particularly around the issue of immigration. We saw that very clearly with Trump in 2016. I also don't think that a whole lot of voters are motivated by a left-wing ideological critique of the Reagan era or support for social democracy.\n\nI think that the questions that actually motivate voters on a real level are fundamentally different from the ones that motivate activists, and the ones that motivate people like me growing up-we're very invested in these economic ideologies. Trump really kind of pulled that back and said this isn't really at a fundamental gut level what's moving people, even though they do have. I write this in the book that it's not like Republicans should just become a party that supports social programs, and that's how you win working-class voters. They do have this gut-level identification with capitalist or free enterprise, or business and hard work as a way of working your way up. But they're just not quite as invested in reading Milton Friedman as maybe that younger version of me was thinking.\n\nGillespie: If the Republican Party no longer seems to be courting libertarians in a way that they were at the end of the aughts to the beginning of the 2000 teens, it doesn't mean that libertarian voters have disappeared. Emily Ekins and David Boaz at the Cato Institute, using various measures that are alternative to some of the ones that you and Lee Trotman use, hypothesize that 10 percent to 20 percent of voters pretty reliably vote socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\n\nWhere do those voters go, assuming they're not completely just making that up? In an election like the one that we're going to have now, in an election like in 2022 or 2016 , w here are those libertarian voters and who do you think they would be going for in something like this?\n\nRuffini: You're right that even if a group is smaller in the electorate, it turns out they matter quite a lot. And I think Joe Biden doesn't win in 2020 without all the third party voters from 2016 who primarily backed him. But when you talk about how we define that socially, more moderate, or liberal and fiscally conservative voter, I think we are used to viewing that libertarian vote as adjacent to the Republican vote. As something that belongs to Republicans. What we'll be actually seeing more and more is more of a crossover between libertarians and Democrats recently. Because those cultural issues seem to be the tie-breaker. They seem to matter more.\n\nNumber one, Trump isn't fiscally conservative. He's not really standing up for that side of the argument. But you also just see social issues and cultural issues kind of matter more. I'm not talking about the hardcore Libertarian Party voter, I am talking about that sort of voter in the northeast corridor, that likes to say they're socially more moderate and fiscally conservative. What you've seen more recently, in a more recent election cycle is that those voters go more Democratic. Whereas that moderate voter again, that's the Obama-Trump voter. That's the voter in Michigan. That's the old autoworker. That's pro-life. They see a role for the government in the economy. Those voters have been moving in completely the opposite directions.\n\nGillespie: What are the signs to look for going into the election, and then after that will there be a long-lived realignment of the parties?\n\nRuffini: We don't necessarily know after 2024 if this new coalition survives. Certainly, there's a case for the shifts that we've seen, particularly as it relates to non-white voters continuing, you're seeing that in the polls right now. There's also a case to be made that this is more of a long-term process. In the book, I write about looking ahead. Let's actually conduct a thought experiment that if this actually happens, what does 2036 look like? What would the election of 2036 look like?\n\nOverwhelmingly, because we have a pretty good idea of what the demographics are going to be in that year. We know the country is just getting more non-white. What would the breakdown need to look like? It would need to look something like this: Republicans draw pretty even among Hispanics, they're winning about maybe 40 percent of Asian voters, and they're winning almost a quarter of the African-American vote. What's interesting is there's polls out there that show that's happening in 2024. It could be that I'm way too conservative. But I think you really have to view this over a long-term trajectory and not election to election, which is very noisy. I think that subject to all sorts of factors that are specific to the cycle.\n\nRight now we have this tendency to view Ronald Reagan as this golden era of Republican normalcy, as somebody who is moderate on immigration and for free trade and for internationalism and global leadership. Certainly, that's true, but I think it understates the extent to which Reagan himself was a disruptive figure in the Republican Party in the '70s and '80s, where he was fundamentally-in the same way Trump is disrupting the existing Republican order-disrupting challenger Gerald Ford from the right. As a result, the party moves, the party shifts, and it becomes a really unambiguously conservative party after Reagan.\n\nIn some way, I think the party will become an unambiguously more populist party. Now, whether or not we have somebody who is quite as much of an avatar of that as Donald Trump in the future, I'm not sure. I think he is somewhat sui generis . I think you will, by default, have somebody more \"normal\" in the future, particularly someone who can get elected president. But, I think that just the baseline has shifted. It shifted with Reagan and I think it's now shifted with Trump.\n\nGillespie: Where do you think the Democratic Party is shifting to? Are they undergoing a similar process, if they are now appealing to educated cosmopolitan voters?\n\nRuffini: It's a coalition that is shifted in terms of the voters it's appealed to significantly. It's really openly making the case on cultural issues, openly making the case for a more open society, really talking up these sort of more abstract concepts of democracy as opposed to the kind of campaign we saw as recently as 2012 when Obama was railing against Mitt Romney as the scion of private equity. You didn't care about people like you. You just don't seem to see that kind of rhetoric anymore, even though that remains part of the party's policy commitment. I don't necessarily think they're going to go conservative on economic issues.\n\nGillespie: Medicare and Social Security appear to be completely inviolate at this point. It is beyond the third rail of American politics now. To even invoke it, other than to say you are going to keep it forever and maybe make it shinier, is complete political death. Is there any way that that's going to change?\n\nRuffini: What's going to change, if nothing else, are the actuarial realities of these programs that are going to impose upon everybody's tidy the political notions and ideas. What you would say now is that it is absolute political death for anybody to touch that entitlement reform. Particularly when you frame the question as cuts to entitlement programs. I think you're absolutely passing that rubicon of we're no longer able to pay out benefits at the state level. It's going to fundamentally be another major disruption, akin to but somewhat I think much greater than what we saw in the last three years with 20 percent inflation. I think that that is going to be in and of itself going to upend a lot of our politics.\n\nBut, Trump intuited, not incorrectly, that this was not a political winner for Republicans and he was actually willing to-and I think probably others had intuited that beforehand-make the argument, which have made it overall very much more difficult for any political party that is calling out for some kind of solution.\n\nGillespie: Are there new ways to talk about entitlement spending that casts it in a more populist sensibility, because it's clear that Social Security and Medicare both take money from relatively young people and relatively poor people and give it to relatively old and relatively rich people. Former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan failed because he didn't make the commercial throwing grandma off a cliff. He should have owned that and said, we need to do this, and she wants that for us anyway.\"\n\nRuffini: It's fundamentally different for a lot of people. You'll have Hispanic voters really voicing the sentiment around, \"We don't want welfare cheats.\" And frankly, that's a real, palpable sentiment. They completely exclude Social Security and Medicare from that calculation.\n\nWhereas for a lot of people, when people take offense to the idea that these are quote-unquote entitlements-aka welfare programs-when the technical definition of an entitlement is you're entitled to it because you theoretically paid into it. Fundamentally, this is actually the political consensus in the working class, is anti-welfare and pro-Social Security. They're making the distinction based on the fact that they believe they paid into these programs, and they're just getting out what they have already paid in. Which is not reality, but that's a very strongly held belief.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for style and clarity.\n\nPhoto Credit: Wennphotostwo121965\n\nNEXT: The Best of Reason : The Future of Immigration Is Privatization\n\nNick Gillespie is an editor at large at Reason and host of The Reason Interview With Nick Gillespie .\n\nShow Comments (64)\n\nPodcast: The Reason Interview With Nick Gillespie\n\n© 2024 Reason Foundation | Accessibility | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Use\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy\n                        Policy and Terms of\n                        Service apply.\n\nDo you care about free minds and free markets?

      "text": "Black Student Expelled for Sexual Assault of White Classmate Seeks Pseudonymity Partly Because \"Interracial Sexual Relationships ...\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 3.28.2025 7:30 AM\n\nNo, says the Seventh Circuit, in yesterday's Doe v. Young , decided by Judges Michael Brennan, Amy St. Eve, and Nancy Maldonado:\n\nAfter the University of Illinois investigated and dismissed him for sexually assaulting another student [Jane Roe], John Doe sued, arguing that the University's investigation was discriminatory and violated his right to due process.... The University ... charged [Doe] with sexual assault, as well as drug manufacturing, sale, and distribution. Both Doe and Roe reportedly ingested \"molly\" (a synthetic drug) prior to the events at issue....\n\nDoe alleged that the University-throughout its investigation-subjected him to race, gender, and disability-based discrimination, and failed to provide sufficient due process. He further alleged that his dismissal from the University was a breach of contract....\n\n[T]he [district] court reviewed {two recent decisions from this court addressing the use of pseudonyms by litigants in Title IX student litigation[,] Doe v. Trs. of Ind. Univ (7th Cir. 2024) and Doe v. Loyola Univ. Chi. (7th Cir. 2024)} .... The court rejected Doe's suggestion that his alleged disabilities (a visual impairment and learning disability) justified proceeding anonymously or that the allegations against him in this case would subject him to acts of violence and harassment....\n\nDistrict judges have the discretion to permit pseudonymous litigation when the balance of harms justifies it. Anonymity can be justified by a minor's status, a substantial risk of harm, or improper retaliation from a third party. However, plaintiffs may not proceed anonymously merely to avoid reputational damage or embarrassment. And while anonymity has been common in Title IX litigation, these cases are \"not an exception to the norm that adult litigants are identified by name.\" We uphold a district court's anonymity decision so long as the correct legal standard was applied, and the decision was based on facts supported by the record....\n\n[Doe] argues, first, that the court ignored the risk of substantial harm he faces if he cannot proceed anonymously. He elaborates that interracial sexual relationships between White women and Black men are the subject of heightened prejudice and violent responses that create a tangible risk of retaliation and animus against him. In support, he cites the dissenting opinion from Thomas v. Lumpkin (2022) (Sotomayor J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari), which discusses the history of racism and prejudice evoked by interracial intimacy between Black men and White women.\n\nBut Doe does little to connect his current circumstances to the historic injustices addressed in the Thomas dissent-a nonbinding opinion in an entirely different context. Nor does he explain how national statistics of on-campus violence show that he, specifically, faces a substantial risk of harm from retaliation.\n\nWe have recognized that anonymity can be justified by a substantial risk of retaliation beyond the reaction legitimately attached to the facts-such as animus toward certain religious groups. Doe v. Elmbrook Sch. Dist . (7th Cir. 2011). But to support a retaliation justification Doe needed to present specific facts showing that he is a potential subject of the racial animus he describes.\n\nFor example, the plaintiffs in Elmbrook pointed to more than religious animus on a national scale-they submitted sworn affidavits showing that they had previously suffered reprisals for airing their views on religion, supported by posts from online forums that included anonymous direct threats to their safety. While we credit the history of racial violence and prejudice that Doe describes, the existence of this racial animus alone-without facts particularizing a threat to Doe-is not enough to show that Doe faces a tangible risk of retaliation.\n\nDoe next points to other potential harms-namely loss of job prospects, reputational harm and loss of privacy-that, he thinks, justify the use of a pseudonym. But in Doe v. Trustees of Indiana University , a similar case where the plaintiff sued his university for sex discrimination during its investigation of his alleged sexual assault of another student, we held that fear of stigmatization and a desire not to reveal intimate details were not enough to justify anonymity for the plaintiff.\n\nPlaintiffs suing in this context are not \"free to inflict reputational harm while sheltering themselves from loss.\" And anonymity is not justified simply because Doe prefers to keep the public from learning that the University found that he committed misconduct.\n\nLastly, Doe relies on an out-of-circuit and a district court decision to advocate for a multifactor approach for anonymity decisions. See, e.g., James v. Jacobson (4th Cir. 1993) (highlighting factors relevant to anonymity decisions, including whether the matter is of a sensitive and highly personal nature); Doe v. Trs. of Ind. Univ . (S.D. Ind. 2022) (recognizing similar multifactor approach). But we have already rejected this approach and held that many of the factors are irrelevant to the determination whether anonymity is appropriate....\n\nThe Seventh Circuit has indeed become a dissenter from the general (though not uniform) trend of district courts allowing pseudonymity to plaintiffs challenging Title IX discipline (see pp. 1441-48 of The Law of Pseudonymous Litigation ). It has also seemingly adopted a more generally skeptical approach to pseudonymous litigation, which would extend outside Title IX cases as well; and this is just one facet of how badly split lower courts are on when litigants should be allowed to proceed pseudonymity.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "We Need to Talk About Black Students Being Accused of Rape Under Title IX\n\nTitle IX\n\nRobby Soave | 9.14.2017 8:00 AM\n\nEmily Yoffe's three - part series on campus sexual assault in The Atlantic is so good that you should read all of it, but if you only read one paragraph, make it this one:\n\nColgate University was recently investigated by the Office for Civil Rights for potential race discrimination, a Title VI violation, in its sexual assault adjudication process. The university was cleared, in April, on the grounds that the numbers did not allow OCR to conclude that race was a statistically significant factor in Colgate's adjudications-in any given year the number of men of any race referred for formal hearings was in the single digits. (The investigation does not appear to have examined any individual cases or otherwise reach beyond this statistical analysis.) But the report did bring those statistics to light, a rarity: In the 2013-14 academic year, 4.2 percent of Colgate's students were black. According to the university's records, in that year black male students were accused of 50 percent of the sexual violations reported to the university, and they made up 40 percent of the students formally adjudicated.\n\nThe emphasis is mine.\n\nAs best we can tell, Colgate isn't an outlier. Yoffe notes that male students of color are \"vastly overrepresented in the cases I've tracked.\" Harvard University Law Professors Janet Halley and Jeannie Suk, who pay attention to Title IX cases and have written about the lack of due process for accused students, share this impression. I do as well.\n\nLeft-leaning victim advocacy groups must at least be aware that college investigations are racially problematic. But they seldom acknowledge this. In fact, the people behind the major activist film about rape on campuses, The Hunting Ground , claimed the purpose of their movie was to undermine the \"dominant white male power\" that pervades the sexual assault crisis. But this is nonsense: as Yoffe notes, in at least three of the four sexual misconduct disputes featured in The Hunting Ground , the accused was a student of color.\n\nIn a piece for The Nation , Elizabeth Adetiba wonders whether \"historical tropes of black men as threats to white women might have played a role in the troubled process.\" (Bizarrely, she also accused Yoffe of not considering the racial element of Title IX cases, which is flat-out wrong. I presume she did not read the third-part in the series; in any case, I tweeted at The Nation requesting a correction.)\n\nWe know these tropes: in less progressive times, black men were thought to be more sexually aggressive and unable to control themselves. These are false, malicious, racist assumptions, and history is full of examples of black men being wrongfully railroaded by white accusers who had some incentive to lie. Emmett Till, a black teenager, was murdered in 1955 after a white woman claimed-falsely-that he made advances toward her. Famous works of literature like To Kill a Mockingbird and A Passage to India involve people of color being wrongfully accused of rape by white women.\n\nIs this what's happening on campus? We don't know. Maybe the numbers are imbalanced because administrators are failing to act on a number of cases involving accused white students-which would suggest the Title IX system is racially biased-or sexual encounters involving non-white men are being reported to campus authorities, but would not have been reported had the male student been white. The alleged victim need not be a racist, because the Title IX process does not require the alleged victim to be the one filing the complaint. Consider the case of Grant Neal , a black athlete accused of sexually abusing a white woman, even though both of them agreed their sex was consensual.\n\nThe point is this: people on the left generally believe-correctly-the efficacy of the criminal justice system is affected by racial bias. Many of the most progressive leftists also think campuses are especially racist places, given all the students chalking #Trump2016 (a more dubious assertion in my view.) Why then do they think it's such a stretch to suggest that Title IX, a powerful mechanism for settling scores, could be weaponized against vulnerable populations: black and immigrant students?\n\nStart your day with Reason .

One study showed that counties with disproportionately African American populations accounted for 52 percent of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58 percent of deaths nationally. Another found that nearly a third of those who have died of COVID-19 are African American-even though black people represented only 14 percent of the population in the areas it analyzed. When asked whether respondents in New York state personally knew anyone who had died of COVID-19, an Associated Press/NORC poll found that only 27 percent of white New Yorkers did, but almost twice as many-47 percent-of black respondents did.\n\nThe economic impact isn't equal, either. One poll found that fewer than half of all Americans said they had \"experienced some kind of household income loss as a result of the outbreak, including job losses, unpaid leave, pay cuts and fewer scheduled hours.\" But that number jumped to 61 percent for Hispanic Americans. In another survey , 45 percent of black workers reported losing their jobs or having their hours cut compared with 31 percent of white workers.\n\nAnd while only 17 percent of white Americans reported being unable to pay at least one type of bill as a result of the pandemic, 37 percent of Latinos and 27 percent of black Americans said the same.\n\nThis comes at a particularly bad time for the Trump campaign, which had been touting its efforts with people of color. According to a report by National Public Radio , there were \"plans for field offices in predominantly black neighborhoods in 15 cities in swing states, and volunteers going door to door ... to boost support among black voters from the 8% of that vote Trump attracted in 2016.\"\n\nBut the real target may have been more specific: black men.\n\nUntil about 1980, men and women voted for the two political parties at about the same rate in modern American presidential elections. Since then, a gender gap has grown steadily. In 2016, Trump lost women by 25 points-the largest gender gap in history . And now, there's a double digit gender gap in Trump's approval rating. In head-to-head matchups with Biden, things only get worse. Before coronavirus, there was a 34-point gender gap: Biden had a 24-point lead among women, while Trump led by 10 points among men.\n\nThe gender gap is becoming more notable across racial lines, and recent polls show why the Trump campaign had planned to open field offices in black neighborhoods. He has improved his standing among minority men.\n\nTrump won 8 percent of all black voters in 2016, but exit polls at the time \"showed him getting 13 percent among black men, more than three times the support he got from black women.\" And that support from men has only increased in the last three years. The most recent NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll found that 24 percent of black men approved of Trump's job performance-four times as many as the 6 percent of black women who said the same.\n\nHarvard's Institute of Politics, which regularly polls young voters, found a staggering 51-point difference in Trump's approval among rural Latino men and women across eight battleground states and that \"many young and male minorities belong to a group it called the 'multicultural middle,' where approval of Trump ran far higher than most other young voters.\"\n\nDemocrats are seeing the same trends. Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, has seen enough in its own \"online surveys over the past several months that indicate a larger share of young black men view Trump favorably than do African American women and older black male voters.\" And while these incremental gains may not seem like much, it has been enough to cause at least one \"Democratic super PAC supporting Mr. Biden [to] soon launch a $3 million digital advertising campaign designed to dissuade younger African-American men from backing the president in the election.\"\n\nThe obvious question is why. Vox recently surveyed many analysts and social scientists who persuasively pointed to things about Trump that appeal to black men specifically. One argued that \"Trump is a genuinely 'aspirational' figure for some African American men\" and another said that \"Trump's business success, his 'gangsta' personal style, and his close association with black male celebrities ... [have] created a real affinity.\"\n\nBut perhaps the growing overall gender gap signals that gender itself is simply becoming more of a defining feature in the current political climate of the last several decades.\n\n\"The conservative ethos of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, asserting patriarchy and male dominance, all of these kinds of traditional gender values, some black men find [them] very appealing,\" Nadia E. Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University, told Vox's Jane Coaston. Or it's the \"machismo, portraying Trump as a tough guy, which may resonate more with some black men and not black women who may worry more about the divisiveness,\" said Karen Finney, a Democratic political consultant.\n\nAnd how will the lopsided racial effects of coronavirus affect the gender gap? Will more black men still vote to re-elect a president who has overseen a pandemic with such a disproportionate impact on their communities?\n\nEven a small increase in Trump's share of the black male vote could have enormous ramifications in states like Michigan and North Carolina. But even short of voting for him, minority men could just stay home, which could have nearly the same effect.\n\nIn her new documentary, Becoming , former first lady Michelle Obama vents her frustration over the outcome of the 2016. \"A lot of our folks didn't vote. It was almost like a slap in the face,\" she said . \"The people who didn't vote at all, the young people, the women, that's when you think, man, people think this is a game. It wasn't just in this election. Every midterm. Every time Barack didn't get the Congress he needed, that was because our folks didn't show up. After all that work, they just couldn't be bothered to vote at all. That's my trauma.\"\n\nPhotograph by Paul J.

      "text": "For Young Black Men in Chicago, a Charter School Helps Them Defy the Odds\n\nMention the South Side of Chicago and images of a crime-infested ghetto leap to mind for many people.\n\nFor black teenagers, life becomes a vicious cycle that most can't shake.\n\nClose to 60 percent of young black men in Chicago do not graduate from high school. Only 6 percent of black males in the ninth grade will earn a bachelor's degree by the time they are 25. And nearly half of black males between the ages of 20 and 24 are both unemployed and out of school, according to a 2016 report by the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nMurders are up about 72 percent year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016, according to Chicago Police Department data. Shootings have risen more than 88 percent.\n\nKevin A. McKee, 18, said he has lived on the south, the east, and the west sides of Chicago, and \"the violence is similar. People get beat, shot, and jumped.\"\n\nMcKee said he avoided trouble because, \"I was taught to go from point A to point B.\"\n\nHe lived with his father and brother for a long time.\n\n\"Growing up, I dealt with a lot,\" McKee said. \"My dad would go to work and I was stuck with my younger brother. At 11 or 12 years old, being responsible for another kid, that was stressful.\"\n\nHe said he and his family didn't have a stable home. \"We shared with different people, we were always moving ... I never really had nice things.\"\n\nThe responsibilities he had to shoulder, and the sheer lack of money, took a toll on McKee's academics. \"I was not an A or B student. I was a C and F student,\" he said.\n\nMcKee was heading down the same road as 60 percent of the young black men in his city. He was afraid for his future and could barely imagine finishing high school, let alone the prospect of college.\n\nHis life took an unexpected turn when a speaker came to his elementary school, Wells Preparatory. The speaker was dressed professionally, wearing a shirt, tie, and blazer-it was Urban Prep Academy's school uniform. McKee was infatuated and knew immediately that he wanted to go to Urban Prep.\n\nAnd he did.\n\nIt was a \"dream come true\" for him. McKee was accepted to the Bronzeville Campus and ended his freshman year with a 3.8 GPA.\n\n\"I felt accomplished,\" he said. \"I felt part of a community. I was around my brothers, people who looked like me.\"\n\nUrban Prep is a nonprofit organization that operates a network of all-boys, all-black public schools-including the country's first charter public high school for boys, said founder, president, and CEO Tim King.\n\nKing launched the first school in 2006 and now operates three campuses in Chicago.\n\nHe said the students come from economically disadvantaged households and are usually behind in many subjects.\n\nUrban Prep's most stunning statistic is not that 95 percent of the students apply for college-but that, since the school opened its doors in 2006, 100 percent have been accepted.\n\nThe teens are surrounded by positive role models and people that push them to achieve their highest potential. \"It's tough to be what you don't see. So it's important that young people seek out positive role models and examples of excellence,\" King said.\n\n\"Students wear a uniform shirt, tie, and blazer each school day, and we use surnames when referring to our young men. In our buildings, students are Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, or Mr. Davis, not Paul, Rob, or Chris,\" King said.\n\nEvery morning the students recite the Urban Prep Creed, a powerful reminder of the school's motto: \"We Believe.\"\n\n\"It is a statement of what we want our students to believe-an articulation of our core values or resilience, relentlessness, integrity, solidarity, exceptionality, selflessness, accountability, and faith,\" King said. \"Words have power. By saying the creed daily, our students embody the ideals it represents.\"\n\nMcKee said reciting the creed every day helped keep the Urban Prep values at the forefront and carry him through.\n\n\"It makes me feel we can make a difference at this school, turn our dreams into reality,\" he said.\n\nHis dreams are now definitely reality-McKee will attend Seattle Pacific University in the fall.\n\n\"We are more than killers, guys who stand on the corner with their pants sagging, we are more,\" McKee said. \"I am the first in my family going to college.\"\n\nSaid King, \"The cycle is broken one person at a time.\""

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), and Rep. Troy Carter (D-La.).\n\nMs. Boebert also shared a photo of herself and Mr. Jackson on her own X account.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson's journey has been a testament to how much a determined individual can succeed through hard work and vision, and yet he still must contend with the oppression that comes from being a minority business owner,\" Mr. Crump said."

      "text": "Behind the Shift in Voting Patterns by Young Black Men\n\nRepublican candidates have received a surge in support among black male voters, a trend that has been building since 2008.\n\nThis year, many expected that black male voters would rally behind Kamala Harris, the first woman of color to achieve the historic milestone of becoming a presidential nominee. However, concerns voiced by Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, suggest that this is not happening.\n\nA closer examination of this crucial voting bloc reveals more complex reasons behind their shift away from the Democratic Party.\n\nRecent polls show that former President Donald Trump has made inroads with black voters, particularly young black men.\n\nMark Ruff, a 26-year-old African American from Birmingham, Michigan, said he is \"definitely\" witnessing this trend firsthand. He said that many peers in his community are considering voting for the Republican candidate in the upcoming election.\n\nRuff described himself as an undecided voter because he feels he hasn't done enough research about both candidates to make an informed decision. However, he observed that some black voters are frustrated with Democratic politicians.\n\n\"It's been years and years, and there are still issues that haven't been taken care of,\" Ruff told The Epoch Times.\n\nSome think it's worth considering what the other side has to offer, he said.\n\nHis friend, Jaleel Anderson, 25, also from Birmingham, echoed the sentiment.\n\nAnderson, who is also African American, shared his personal experience of growing up in a household that supported the Democratic Party, where his parents' voting habits influenced his opinion as a child.\n\nAs he grew up, he and his friends believed they would naturally support Democrats due to family tradition, without giving it much thought.\n\n\"I'm 99 percent sure my mom voted for Al Gore and 100 percent sure she voted for Obama,\" Anderson told The Epoch Times. \"Now, I see a lot of undecided voters, at least among the people I know, and they are open to hearing what the other side has to say.\"\n\nAnderson cited education and the economy as his top issues. He described himself as an undecided voter, though he said he leans toward conservative viewpoints, largely influenced by his strong Christian faith.\n\n\"I think this election, you're probably not going to have a lot of black folks leaning left, and if not this election, the next one, for sure,\" Anderson said. \"You might see more of a polarizing shift in terms of political alignment within the African American community.\"\n\nRecent polls show that Vice President Harris is struggling to gain the same level of support from black voters as her predecessors, Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nWhile most black voters (63 percent) plan to support Harris in this year's election, black men and younger black voters are slightly more likely to be undecided or Trump supporters, according to a recent survey by the NAACP.\n\nThe survey revealed that 58 percent of black men and 67 percent of black women support Harris. Among black men under 50, support for her drops to just 49 percent. In contrast, 26 percent of black men under 50 favor Trump.\n\nFor example, in Georgia, black Americans represent one-third of eligible voters, the highest percentage among swing states. Biden won the state by a razor-thin margin of nearly 12,000 votes in 2020.\n\nHarris will face a major challenge if she cannot achieve the same level of black voter turnout that Democrats secured in 2020.\n\nJoe Lou, a 68-year-old Uber driver from Atlanta, is backing Trump. Lou, an African American, said that many in his community are planning to vote for the former president.\n\n\"It's all about the economy,\" he told The Epoch Times. \"People don't agree with focusing on transgenderism and migrants.\"\n\nLou said he believes most Trump voters in his community are entrepreneurs.\n\n\"We don't want to be taxed to death just because we worked hard and made it,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that many black Americans are hesitant to express their support for Trump due to fear of retaliation.\n\nHe mentioned recent remarks by Obama. \"I felt that he had no right to tell black men how to vote,\" Lou said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Obama criticized black men for making excuses not to vote for Harris.\n\n\"We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" he said during a campaign event in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"That seems to be more pronounced with the brothers,\" Obama continued, referring to African American men.\n\n\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. And you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" he said, adding that choosing Trump over Harris based on gender is \"not acceptable.\"\n\nSome black men have stated that their decision not to vote for Harris isn't influenced by gender. They prioritize economy and education as key issues and aren't satisfied with the Democratic Party's policies, believing they have been overlooked.\n\nAccording to Anderson, Obama's speech could be particularly effective for black men who may not be familiar with Harris.\n\n\"I like that Obama guy. Yeah, let's vote for Kamala. He's backing her,\" he suggested people might say.\n\nMany remember Obama's eight years in office as good years, he noted, so that message could resonate with them.\n\n\"He said the quiet part out loud,\" she told The Epoch Times. \"It takes a courageous person to say the thing that so many are thinking, but for whatever reason are afraid to say. And he did that in that moment.\"\n\nBond also noted that there will always be naysayers when someone speaks the truth.\n\n\"There are things that he said that people could resonate with,\" she said.\n\nBond also acknowledged that black men often feel underrepresented when it comes to policies. This election cycle, she said, voters are increasingly demanding clarity on how candidates' policies address their needs and concerns.\n\nJordan Johnson, a 31-year-old warehouse director from Jacksonville, Florida, said he's unlikely to vote, but if he did, he would choose Trump.\n\nThe African American expressed frustration with Harris. He said that she avoids directly answering questions about how she would improve the economy or make the country better.\n\nHowever, Robert Edmond, a public health professional from Atlanta, doesn't share the sentiment. He said he has already voted for the vice president in early voting.\n\n\"I am very proud and supportive of her policies,\" the 37-year-old African American told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"I think she's going to be influential in helping the middle class,\" Edmond said. \"I think she's going to be a good president for incorporating inclusivity and helping stabilize our country.\"\n\nHe also said that most of his peers see Harris as a competent and experienced politician.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Oct. 20 that Democrats need to \"keep doing the work\" to overcome concerns about black voter turnout in the battleground state.\n\n\"Oh, we just have to keep doing the work,\" he said. \"And the good news is, that's exactly what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing. They're not taking anything for granted.\"\n\nA mecca for black Americans, Atlanta is also the largest city in a crucial state for both campaigns.\n\nMichaelah Montgomery, a Georgia activist who spoke ahead of Trump at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center, questioned Obama's recent comments about black male voters.\n\n\"How dare you single out black men and act like it's their fault?\" Montgomery said of Obama's remarks.\n\n\"Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don't owe our votes to any candidate just because they 'look like us,'\" the group stated.\n\nDuring her speech at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Harris aimed her message at black voters, emphasizing the significance of the moment in U.S. history.\n\n\"In this moment, our country is at a crossroads, and where we go from here is up to us, as Americans and as people of faith,\" she said. \"And now we ask a question: We face this question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion, and justice?\""

When we're in trouble, and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting.\n\n\"And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that's a sign of strength; because that's what being a man is? Putting people down? That's unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump responded in a post on social media, saying, \"Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men.\"\n\nIn his recorded remarks, Obama claimed that Harris, who has a black father and South Asian mother, was more identifiable to black men than Trump.\n\n\"You have a choice that is this clear ... you have somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences, who's had to work harder, and do more, and overcome and achieves the second-highest office in the land,\" he said.\n\n\"She would have to realize that a black man can trust no one, not even a black woman,\" said Al Smith, a 34-year-old black male voter and business owner in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nEven among black male supporters, Harris has been criticized for being unclear about her policy program.\n\n\"You really gotta get very clear on what you're fighting against, and you gotta be really contemporary with your examples,\" said Russell, a black business owner who supports Harris and prefers not to disclose his last name."

      "text": "Harris Struggles to Win Over Some Black Male Voters, a Key Democratic Voting Bloc\n\nSherman Younger, a registered voter from the small town of Chatham in Virginia, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. This year, however, he is on the fence about supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nYounger is one of the undecided voters who hold significant sway in the upcoming presidential election, as Harris and former President Donald Trump vie for their support.\n\n\"The cost of living is too high,\" the 59-year-old car mechanic told The Epoch Times.\n\nHe said that Harris is struggling to win over black male voters, including himself. While Younger doesn't rule out voting for Harris, he notes that some men in his community express doubts about a woman leading the country, citing cultural barriers.\n\nBecause of his job, Younger commutes daily to Greensboro, North Carolina, a key battleground where Harris held a campaign rally a few weeks ago.\n\n\"I couldn't help but notice that the majority were women,\" Younger said of rallygoers, citing a stark gender gap in support for Harris.\n\nThe Democratic nominee recognizes the challenge with black men, a crucial voter group that could greatly impact her prospects at the polls in November.\n\nIn a recent interview, the vice president admitted that she must do more to earn the support of this key Democratic voting bloc.\n\n\"I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody's pocket,\" she said during an interview hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Sept. 17.\n\n\"Black men are like any other voting group. You've got to earn their vote.\"\n\nRecent polling data underscores Harris's challenge. A survey by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) showed that 63 percent of black voters support Harris, while 13 percent favor Trump.\n\n\"If Trump wins high teens of black voters-if he gets more than 15 or 16 percent of the black vote-this thing is over. He will win Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia,\" according to Republican strategist Brian Seitchik.\n\nAccording to the NAACP survey, which polled 1,000 registered black voters across the country from Aug. 6 to Aug. 12, the disparity in support is particularly significant when it comes to gender.\n\nSixty-seven percent of black women back Harris. However, among black men under 50, for example, her support falls to 49 percent, while Trump's favorability jumps to 26 percent.\n\nMartin owns a small business that transports parts for General Motors and Ford.\n\n\"I'm thinking about the taxes,\" the 47-year-old said.\n\nHe is also dissatisfied with the country's infrastructure. \"It seems like it never gets done,\" he said.\n\nFor the entrepreneur, race or gender isn't top of mind. In his view, national politicians are \"not delivering on the things that they say.\"\n\nAl Smith, a 34-year-old autobody repair shop owner from Greensboro, North Carolina, echoed the same sentiment.\n\nSmith, who is African American and a Trump supporter, expressed skepticism about Harris's ability to effectively address the nation's issues.\n\nHe is not surprised about the low support for Harris among black male voters.\n\n\"She would have to realize that a black man can trust no one, not even a black woman,\" Smith told The Epoch Times.\n\nWhile Smith appreciates Trump's track record of keeping promises, he acknowledges that some of the former president's proposals, particularly on immigration, may be extreme.\n\nConversely, Dante White, a 37-year-old Chick-fil-A worker from the same city, expressed his support for Harris.\n\n\"I think she'll be a good president,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\nFor him, the key issues are health care and food stamps. \"I don't want them to be taken away,\" said White, who relies on Medicaid.\n\nHe believes the country should invest more in education and thinks Harris would advocate for that.\n\nThe 43-year-old Uber driver from Annandale, Virginia, cites the economy as his biggest issue.\n\n\"The cost of living in the [Washington] D.C. area is outrageous,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe dollar's strength against other currencies is important to him as he frequently travels overseas, he said, and he supports Trump's commitment to keeping the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nJerome was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 but voted for Trump in 2020.\n\nMany voters, like Jerome, still favor Trump over Harris on handling the economy. However, in recent weeks, the vice president has been trimming the Republican challenger's long-time lead on this issue.\n\nNational and swing-state polls still show a tight race between Harris and Trump less than six weeks before the election.\n\nThe Harris campaign has ramped up efforts to increase turnout among black and Latino men in key swing states. As part of this strategy, the campaign is investing in ads targeting younger men during major league baseball games, college football broadcasts, and soccer matches across key battleground states.\n\nThe campaign also recently bought advertising space on IGN, a leading news website for video games.\n\nThe Harris campaign, however, avoids highlighting the historic nature of her candidacy as a female contender in this race.\n\nDemocratic strategist Christopher Bruce emphasized the need for Harris to present her policies more effectively to resonate with black male voters.\n\n\"Polls don't vote. People do,\" he said, expressing optimism about Harris's potential to connect with this demographic.\n\n\"I think she has a strong record and a strong policy agenda,\" Bruce said.\n\n\"We're seeing a pretty sizable gender gap,\" he told The Epoch Times, adding that women are leaning toward Harris while men are favoring Trump.\n\n\"There's always been a gender gap, but that delta does seem especially pronounced this cycle.\"\n\nSeitchik said Trump needs to appeal to female voters in the final stretch, specifically college-educated women in the suburbs of Phoenix, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.\n\nConversely, Harris needs to focus more on engaging blue-collar men and ensuring she effectively mobilizes support within the black community, he noted."

      "text": "Behind the Shift in Voting Patterns by Young Black Men\n\nRepublican candidates have received a surge in support among black male voters, a trend that has been building since 2008.\n\nThis year, many expected that black male voters would rally behind Kamala Harris, the first woman of color to achieve the historic milestone of becoming a presidential nominee. However, concerns voiced by Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, suggest that this is not happening.\n\nA closer examination of this crucial voting bloc reveals more complex reasons behind their shift away from the Democratic Party.\n\nRecent polls show that former President Donald Trump has made inroads with black voters, particularly young black men.\n\nMark Ruff, a 26-year-old African American from Birmingham, Michigan, said he is \"definitely\" witnessing this trend firsthand. He said that many peers in his community are considering voting for the Republican candidate in the upcoming election.\n\nRuff described himself as an undecided voter because he feels he hasn't done enough research about both candidates to make an informed decision. However, he observed that some black voters are frustrated with Democratic politicians.\n\n\"It's been years and years, and there are still issues that haven't been taken care of,\" Ruff told The Epoch Times.\n\nSome think it's worth considering what the other side has to offer, he said.\n\nHis friend, Jaleel Anderson, 25, also from Birmingham, echoed the sentiment.\n\nAnderson, who is also African American, shared his personal experience of growing up in a household that supported the Democratic Party, where his parents' voting habits influenced his opinion as a child.\n\nAs he grew up, he and his friends believed they would naturally support Democrats due to family tradition, without giving it much thought.\n\n\"I'm 99 percent sure my mom voted for Al Gore and 100 percent sure she voted for Obama,\" Anderson told The Epoch Times. \"Now, I see a lot of undecided voters, at least among the people I know, and they are open to hearing what the other side has to say.\"\n\nAnderson cited education and the economy as his top issues. He described himself as an undecided voter, though he said he leans toward conservative viewpoints, largely influenced by his strong Christian faith.\n\n\"I think this election, you're probably not going to have a lot of black folks leaning left, and if not this election, the next one, for sure,\" Anderson said. \"You might see more of a polarizing shift in terms of political alignment within the African American community.\"\n\nRecent polls show that Vice President Harris is struggling to gain the same level of support from black voters as her predecessors, Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nWhile most black voters (63 percent) plan to support Harris in this year's election, black men and younger black voters are slightly more likely to be undecided or Trump supporters, according to a recent survey by the NAACP.\n\nThe survey revealed that 58 percent of black men and 67 percent of black women support Harris. Among black men under 50, support for her drops to just 49 percent. In contrast, 26 percent of black men under 50 favor Trump.\n\nFor example, in Georgia, black Americans represent one-third of eligible voters, the highest percentage among swing states. Biden won the state by a razor-thin margin of nearly 12,000 votes in 2020.\n\nHarris will face a major challenge if she cannot achieve the same level of black voter turnout that Democrats secured in 2020.\n\nJoe Lou, a 68-year-old Uber driver from Atlanta, is backing Trump. Lou, an African American, said that many in his community are planning to vote for the former president.\n\n\"It's all about the economy,\" he told The Epoch Times. \"People don't agree with focusing on transgenderism and migrants.\"\n\nLou said he believes most Trump voters in his community are entrepreneurs.\n\n\"We don't want to be taxed to death just because we worked hard and made it,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that many black Americans are hesitant to express their support for Trump due to fear of retaliation.\n\nHe mentioned recent remarks by Obama. \"I felt that he had no right to tell black men how to vote,\" Lou said.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Obama criticized black men for making excuses not to vote for Harris.\n\n\"We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" he said during a campaign event in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"That seems to be more pronounced with the brothers,\" Obama continued, referring to African American men.\n\n\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. And you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" he said, adding that choosing Trump over Harris based on gender is \"not acceptable.\"\n\nSome black men have stated that their decision not to vote for Harris isn't influenced by gender. They prioritize economy and education as key issues and aren't satisfied with the Democratic Party's policies, believing they have been overlooked.\n\nAccording to Anderson, Obama's speech could be particularly effective for black men who may not be familiar with Harris.\n\n\"I like that Obama guy. Yeah, let's vote for Kamala. He's backing her,\" he suggested people might say.\n\nMany remember Obama's eight years in office as good years, he noted, so that message could resonate with them.\n\n\"He said the quiet part out loud,\" she told The Epoch Times. \"It takes a courageous person to say the thing that so many are thinking, but for whatever reason are afraid to say. And he did that in that moment.\"\n\nBond also noted that there will always be naysayers when someone speaks the truth.\n\n\"There are things that he said that people could resonate with,\" she said.\n\nBond also acknowledged that black men often feel underrepresented when it comes to policies. This election cycle, she said, voters are increasingly demanding clarity on how candidates' policies address their needs and concerns.\n\nJordan Johnson, a 31-year-old warehouse director from Jacksonville, Florida, said he's unlikely to vote, but if he did, he would choose Trump.\n\nThe African American expressed frustration with Harris. He said that she avoids directly answering questions about how she would improve the economy or make the country better.\n\nHowever, Robert Edmond, a public health professional from Atlanta, doesn't share the sentiment. He said he has already voted for the vice president in early voting.\n\n\"I am very proud and supportive of her policies,\" the 37-year-old African American told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"I think she's going to be influential in helping the middle class,\" Edmond said. \"I think she's going to be a good president for incorporating inclusivity and helping stabilize our country.\"\n\nHe also said that most of his peers see Harris as a competent and experienced politician.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Oct. 20 that Democrats need to \"keep doing the work\" to overcome concerns about black voter turnout in the battleground state.\n\n\"Oh, we just have to keep doing the work,\" he said. \"And the good news is, that's exactly what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are doing. They're not taking anything for granted.\"\n\nA mecca for black Americans, Atlanta is also the largest city in a crucial state for both campaigns.\n\nMichaelah Montgomery, a Georgia activist who spoke ahead of Trump at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center, questioned Obama's recent comments about black male voters.\n\n\"How dare you single out black men and act like it's their fault?\" Montgomery said of Obama's remarks.\n\n\"Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don't owe our votes to any candidate just because they 'look like us,'\" the group stated.\n\nDuring her speech at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Harris aimed her message at black voters, emphasizing the significance of the moment in U.S. history.\n\n\"In this moment, our country is at a crossroads, and where we go from here is up to us, as Americans and as people of faith,\" she said. \"And now we ask a question: We face this question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear, and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion, and justice?\""
