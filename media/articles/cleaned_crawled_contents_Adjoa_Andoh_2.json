      "text": "What Shakespeare can teach us about racism\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's famous tragedy \" Othello \" is often the first play that comes to mind when people think of Shakespeare and race . And if not \"Othello,\" then folks usually name \" The Merchant of Venice ,\" \" Antony and Cleopatra ,\" \" The Tempest ,\" or his first - and bloodiest - tragedy, \" Titus Andronicus ,\" my favorite Shakespeare play.\n\nAmong Shakespeare scholars, those five works are known as his traditionally understood \"race plays\" and include characters who are Black like Othello, Jewish like Shylock, Indigenous like Caliban, or Black African like Cleopatra.\n\nBut what did Shakespeare have to say about race in plays such as \" Hamlet \" and \" Macbeth ,\" where Black characters do not have a dominant role, for example?\n\nAs Shakespeare scholars who study race know, all of his plays address race in some way. How could they not?\n\nAfter all, every human being has a racial identity, much like every living human being breathes. Said another way, every character Shakespeare breathed life into has a racial identity, from Hamlet to Hippolyta .\n\nThe playwright wrote about many key subjects during the late 15th and early 16th centuries that are relevant today, including  gender, addiction, sexuality, mental health, social psychology, sexual violence , antisemitism, sexism and, of course, race .\n\nIn my book \" Shakespeare's White Others ,\" I explore the intraracial divisions that Shakespeare illustrates in all his plays.\n\nHere are four things to know about Shakespeare and race.\n\nFor a long time, I was afraid of Shakespeare. I am not the only one.\n\nIn his 1964 essay \" Why I Stopped Hating Shakespeare ,\" James Baldwin detailed his initial resistance. Like many people today, Baldwin wrote that he, too, was \"a victim of that loveless education which causes so many schoolboys to detest Shakespeare.\"\n\nA major part of Baldwin's loathing of Shakespeare had nothing to do with the English writer specifically, but rather the white elitism that surrounded his work and literature.\n\nBut as Baldwin eventually realized, Shakespeare was not the \" author of his oppression .\"\n\nJust as Shakespeare didn't create misogyny and sexism, he didn't create race and racism. Rather, he observed the complex realities of the world around him, and through his plays he articulated an underlying hope for a more just world.\n\n\" Titus Andronicus \" featured the playwright's first Black character, Aaron. In that play, written near the end of the 16th century, the white Roman empress, Tamora, cheats on her white emperor husband, Saturninus, with Aaron. When Tamora eventually gives birth to a baby, it's clear Tamora's baby daddy isn't Saturninus.\n\nConsequently, the white characters who know about the infant's real father urge Aaron to kill his newborn Black son. But Aaron refuses. He opts instead to fiercely protect his beloved child.\n\nVintage engraving of a scene from Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus.'\n\nGetty Images\n\nAmid all the drama that occurs around the child's existence, Shakespeare momentarily offers a beautiful defense of Blackness in the play's fourth act.\n\n\"Is black so base a hue?\" Aaron initially asks before challenging the cultural norm. \"Coal-black is better than another hue, in that it scorns to bear another hue.\"\n\nIn other words, at least to Aaron, being Black was beautiful, Blackness exuded strength.\n\nSuch words about the Black identity are not uttered elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays - not even by the more popular Othello .\n\nIn plays such as \" Hamlet ,\" \"Macbeth\" and \" Romeo and Juliet ,\" race still figures in the drama even when there are no dominant Black characters.\n\nShakespeare does this by illustrating the formation and maintenance of the white identity. In a sense, Shakespeare details the nuances of race through his characters' racial similarities, thus making racial whiteness very visible.\n\nAn image of what is considered the most important book in English literature, William Shakespeare's 'The First Folio 1623.'\n\nScott Barbour/Getty Images\n\nIn Shakespeare's time, much like our present moment, the presumed superiority of whiteness meant social status was negotiated by everyone based on the dominant culture's standards.\n\nIn several of his plays, for instance, the playwright uses \"white hands\" as noble symbols of purity and white superiority. He also called attention to his character's race by describing them as \"white\" or \"fair.\"\n\nShakespeare also used black as a metaphor for being tainted.\n\nOne such moment occurs in the comedy \" Much Ado About Nothing .\"\n\nA young white woman, Hero, is falsely accused of cheating on her fiancé. On their wedding day, Hero's groom, Claudio, charges her with being unfaithful. Claudio and Hero's father, Leonato, then shame Hero for being allegedly unchaste, a no-no for 16th-century English women who were legally their father's and then their husband's property.\n\nWith Hero's sexual purity allegedly tainted, her father describes her as having \"fallen into a pit of ink.\"\n\nSex before marriage violated the male-dominated culture's expectations for unwed white women.\n\nThus, in that play, Hero momentarily represents an \"inked\" white woman - or a symbolic reflection of the stereotyped, hypersexual Black woman.\n\nToday, scholars are publishing new insights on the social, cultural and political issues of Shakespeare's time and our own. In fact, there are dozens of scholars and theater practitioners devoting their professional lives to exploring race in Shakespeare's literature and time period.\n\nIn his 2000 book \" Shakespeare Jungle Fever: National-Imperial Re-Visions of Race, Rape, and Sacrifice ,\" UCLA English professor Arthur L. Little Jr. explored British imperialism, racialized whiteness and the sexual myths about Black men.\n\nIn 2020, playwright Anchuli Felicia King wrote \" Keene ,\" a satirical riff on \"Othello\" that offers a modern-day critique on whiteness. In \"Keene,\" Kai, a Japanese musicologist, and Tyler, a Black Ph.D. student, meet at a Shakespeare conference where they are the only two people of color at the elite white gathering. While Tyler is focused on writing his thesis, Kai is focused on Tyler. A romance ensues, only to see Tyler - much like Othello before him - betrayed by his closet white confidant, Ian.\n\nIn 2019, British actress Adjoa Andoh directed Shakespeare's \" Richard II \" with a cast of all women of color - a production that she called \"a thought experiment into the universality of humanity.\"\n\nDavid Sterling Brown , Associate Professor of English, Trinity College\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Bridgerton's Leading Man Regé-Jean Page On Ripping Up The Period Drama Rulebook\n\nAdam Bloodworth\n\nOn first glance, you might think Netflix's bold new period drama Bridgerton centres on a traditional romantic storyline between eligible bachelor Simon Hastings, The Duke of Hastings, and Daphne Bridgerton, one of the young daughters of the titular household.\n\nBut Daphne and The Duke are different.\n\nThese characters aren't willing to conform to the restrictive social politics of the day by marrying a suitor when society expects them to, so they form a plan to fend off aggressive matchmaking from encircling relatives.\n\nThis is where Bridgerton takes a fresh approach to the period drama. It may be set in 1813, but the show aims to authentically represent young people with properly-realised lead characters whose conversations about love and relationships aren't just celebratory, but express doubt and are not schmaltzy or two-dimensional.\n\nSpeaking of the show's approach, Regé-Jean Page who plays The Duke tells HuffPost UK that people have always been confused about what they want from love and life since the dawn of time - it's just these complexities are rarely seen in period dramas.\n\n\"You genuinely think you invented it, don't you?\" reflects Regé-Jean of how humans experience heartache. \"It's like, mate, we didn't invent it, everyone's been living this since year dot - people are people - they've always been the same.\"\n\nWe aren't all immediately after a suitor in reality - and Bridgerton in Regé-Jean's eyes is symbolic of how film and TV is \"getting better at respecting that\".\n\n\"They want to learn how to love, to learn how to be the best version of themselves, to learn how to live life to its fullest despite what their family wants or what society wants,\" continues Regé-Jean of the show's characters. \"So what changes is the restrictions - the corsets, the clothes, the societal laws or whatever else, but people are still the same, you know?\"\n\nBold in the way it deals with emotion, Bridgerton is also ground-breaking in other ways. The show has a racially diverse cast auditioned using colour conscious casting, which means there was an effort made to represent diverse backgrounds, while aesthetically it is also hugely ambitious: the wardrobe featured 7,500 individually made outfits, and crew exclaimed how they'd never seen sets this big in sound studios before.\n\nBack inside the plot, there's incredibly raunchy scenes, including representation of how the LGBTQ community may have experienced sex and relationships in pre-Victorian England.\n\nThe first Netflix series from Shondaland , the production company behind Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, Bridgerton feels as if there was no expense spared.\n\n\"The very early conversations I had with [showrunner] Chris Van Dusen and Shonda about what they were doing with this project were about this big open space that we had to run into, because period drama is seen as a very traditional genre with very traditional rules,\" reflects Regé-Jean. \"Which gave us so much space to explore what had been neglected with that - we could bring in this freshness, this energy.\"\n\nElaborate shots showing aristocracy sweeping from townhouses onto horse drawn carriages and gossiping on grand doorsteps were filmed in Bath, Yorkshire, London and Hertfordshire, anchoring the show in visually familiar territory.\n\n\"We talk a lot about mixed casting, but actually what you forget is it's really good fun,\" says Adjoa Andoh, who plays the formidable Lady Danbury, a friend of the Duke's late mother. \"There's that sort of addictive joyful vibrant quality and I think this year of all years it's a blessing that it's coming out at Christmas. I think it'll lift the spirits.\"\n\nLady Danbury's ball in the first episode (there are eight in season on) exudes the show's high energy and Blockbuster feel. \"If you'd seen the stage directions in the script it's like it's on steroids,\" laughs Adjoa down Zoom. \"And you just have to go with it - to have that energy on a period drama is quite thrilling.\"\n\nThe ball is an example of how in high society, young women were often forced to present themselves as marriage material before they are ready. Amongst the flirtation from the lavishly-dressed women and sharply shaved men there are those who do not feel suited to this environment, no matter how glamorous.\n\nThe Duke professes to never wanting to marry and at first his ego means he is hard to sympathise with. \"Unlike you, I cannot simply declare I do not wish to marry, I do not have such a privilege,\" barks Daphne Bridgerton early on.\n\nBut as his story unfolds, Regé-Jean was tasked with interrogating what it means that The Duke sees himself as perpetually single. His character provides the opportunity to delve further into the topic of masculinity more broadly: what it means today and what it meant then.\n\n\"Simon is clearly in the tradition of romantic archetypes, your Darcys, your Heathcliffes,\" begins Regé-Jean. \"I wanted to examine and interrogate what makes that archetype attractive, what makes them worthy of being an object of desire, how do they find love and find the ability to love because these are tall dark mysterious broken anti-heroes, the Clint Eastwoods of culture.\"\n\nWe're living in an age where masculinity is constantly being questioned: are there any clear cut ways to determine what makes a good, morally upstanding, or attractive man?\n\nRegé-Jean feels he certainly knows what it isn't: \"This constant need for dominance and strength, having walls up, this kind of silent broker cowboy who needs to have something that can be redeemed before he is actually worthy of love, there is a missing piece to that strength.\"\n\n\"There is strength to letting go of grief, or at least processing grief more helpfully than we've necessary seen in these corseted upper class dramas before.\"\"\n\n\"And that's where I think vulnerability comes in - the fact that we're figuring out that there is strength in actually being vulnerable to one another, there is strength to letting go of grief, or at least processing grief more helpfully than we've necessary seen, particularly in these corseted upper class dramas before.\n\n\"There are enormous pressures on young men at the moment,\" adds Adjoa. \"To work out who the hell they are, and how they're supposed to be in the world, how they're supposed to be perceived, and what they are allowed to be.\"\n\nRegé-Jean concludes: \"It's well beyond time to bring that into the conversation of how you build a masculine romantic hero - and I was excited to try and contribute to that story, because that I think is the 21st century story that we're in the middle of now.\"\n\n\"Not boys don't cry, boys should cry, and it makes you healthier and stronger for it.\"\n\nBridgerton is available to stream on Netflix now."

      "text": "Why 'Queen Charlotte' Is More Compelling Than The Original 'Bridgerton' Series\n\nGuest Writer\n\n\"Queen Charlotte,\" the \" Bridgerton \" prequel and spinoff that premiered on Netflix this month, is all about the show's matriarchs: Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), Lady Agatha Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) and Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell).\n\nIn the first season of the original \"Bridgerton\" series, we meet each woman in an unusual place. Charlotte has long been the queen of England after marrying King George, and the face of the monarchy because of her husband's mental illness. Lady Danbury has long been widowed, which gives her an unusual amount of financial power and independence. Violet is more recently widowed and trying to marry off the first of her eight children, hoping her daughter finds a love match as true as her own.\n\n\"Queen Charlotte\" explores those women's realities - the consequences of their marriages over time - and I absolutely loved it.\n\nThe show tells two parallel storylines: young Charlotte's arranged marriage to King George when she was just 17 and the older Queen Charlotte's desperate desire for one of her 13(!) children who lived to adulthood to produce a legitimate heir.\n\nThe first episode opens with young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) on her way to meet and wed young George (Corey Mylchreest). The betrothal contract was signed by her older brother, Adolphus (Tunji Kasim), and the trade agreements have already been made, so there is no backing out. However, Charlotte refuses to suffer her fate in silence. Thus ensues one of the best exchanges of dialogue in the entire season, a conversation that includes Charlotte's ironic exclamation of \"how joyful it is to be a lady.\" (TV and film writers, including those who worked on \"Queen Charlotte,\" are currently on strike over pay and working conditions.)\n\nThe show thrives on the tension that exists between society's expectations of women and these characters' desire for agency. Their search for this all-too-elusive joy - be it partnership or independence or a second chance at love - is what captivated me throughout the six episodes.\n\nIt also helped that young Charlotte and young George have the same spark at first sight as Daphne and Simon or Anthony and Kate from the previous \"Bridgerton\" installments. Charlotte meets George when she is trying to escape before the wedding by climbing over a garden wall.\n\nIt spoils nothing - everyone who has watched the series knows Charlotte does not go over the wall - to reveal that she marries King George just moments after meeting him. However, this decision - while inevitable because of the aforementioned contracts and trade agreements - is also framed, as much as it can be, as a choice. King George says as much, even if it's not entirely true, before he delivers a charming kiss on her hand and says that he hopes to see her at the altar.\n\nBy the end of the first episode, the two are wed. The real drama begins on their wedding night, when it becomes clear that George is hiding something and that consummating their marriage and producing an heir will be more difficult than expected. So unlike the first two seasons of \"Bridgerton,\" the conflict is not will they or won't they. Instead, it's what happens now. What happens after young Charlotte marries young George?\n\nThese conflicts become even more tense because Charlotte and George hold the weight of the British monarchy and the well-being of Black citizens on their shoulders. Their interracial union - he's white and she's Black - is what makes racial progress possible in the rest of England. Thus, \"The Great Experiment\" of Black people becoming full members of the ton rests on their shoulders, as does the fate of young Agatha Danbury.\n\nIn addition to its focus on Charlotte and George's marriage, the show also explores the relationships of Lady Danbury and Violet Bridgerton. It depicts how Lady Danbury gained her title and her freedom and how elder Violet navigates losing the love of her life with the very human desires she still has for connection.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, these questions and the juxtaposition between the older and younger characters' storylines are why I haven't stopped talking about \"Queen Charlotte\" with everyone I know, especially the people who have been in long-term relationships.\n\nYes, the show's characters have the same undeniable chemistry and steamy sex scenes, but \"Queen Charlotte\" captures even more complexity than the original \"Bridgeton\" series. In those seasons, the wounds of the characters (the abuse Simon suffered from his father and the traumatic death of Anthony's father) feature heavily as factors that could keep the couples apart.\n\nHowever, in \"Queen Charlotte,\" the marriages themselves are the conflict. How will Charlotte cope with the secret George is hiding in addition to the responsibilities and isolation of being queen? Can Agatha Danbury escape the weight of her loveless marriage? Will Violet Bridgerton acknowledge that her desires didn't die with her beloved husband?\n\nTo me, as someone who will have been married for six years this month but who began dating her husband almost 15 years ago, these questions are what make \"Queen Charlotte\" worth watching and even more compelling than the original \"Bridgerton\" series.\n\nIn Episode 2 of the show, the three matriarchs sip tea and argue about the purpose of marriage. Is it duty? Is it pleasure?\n\nAs anyone who has been in a long relationship knows, it is often both. The scales tip back and forth with the ups and downs of life - for better or worse, in sickness or health. The women of \"Queen Charlotte\" portray different ways for women to keep their footing, to not let the men or the circumstances of their lives or the patriarchal society they inhabit knock them too far off balance. The way these three women strive for personal joy within their circumstances is inspiring. Maybe it's why I connected so much with the show. Maybe the marriages in \"Queen Charlotte\" are not that different from our own. Maybe that in and of itself helps us see the joy that exists within the walls of our own loves and our own lives.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Even as companies like Walmart , Ford and Molson Coors have retreated from their diversity, equity and inclusion programs for employees known as DEI due in part to pressure from conservative activists, businesses across the U.S. continue to churn out commercials reflecting their acknowledgment that the consumer base is indeed increasingly diverse.

It's why you see ads with so many mixed-race couples planning for vacations and shopping for home appliances. And it's likely why companies like Boots, Jaguar and others will nod to a wave of diversity that includes trans, nonbinary, gay or gender-fluid individuals.\n\nConsider this: A Gallup poll released in 2023 found that 1 in 4 high school students surveyed in the U.S. identify as being somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum. Of the students surveyed in 152 schools nationwide, 26% identified as LGBTQ, 12% identified as bisexual, 5.2% identified as questioning, 3.9% identified as other, 3.2% said they were gay or lesbian, and almost 2% said they did not understand the question.\n\nOne in four is a large number. Those students will soon be adults deciding where they purchase soap powder and SUVs. And with numbers that large, those students are dispersed all across America in all kinds of communities, and maybe even inside the families of the people bellowing most loudly about an ad that riffs on a fanciful brown-skinned, be-Afroed Mrs. Claus character, surrounded by a swirl of festively efficient elves who appear to be queer, trans or gay - or folks perfectly comfortable working alongside that cohort.\n\nThe fact is, not everyone is comfortable working or living alongside that cohort. That is going to take some time, and in truth we might not get there for decades. Our divisions seem to be widening. So, for people who hate the themes and ideas presented in the Boots commercial's glimmering rendition of Santa's \"werkshop,\" maybe the best thing is to treat it like a Christmas present you never really wanted. Put it aside. Lock it away. Put it out of view and understand that everything is not for everyone.

      "text": "The Biggest Differences Between Bridgerton and the Book Series That Inspired It\n\nThe eight-episode first season of Netflix's Bridgerton covers roughly the same time frame as The Duke and I , the first book in Julia Quinn's romance series. However, the Shonda Rhimes-produced drama also borrows plotlines from the other seven books in the series-and takes quite a few liberties with its source material along the way. We've rounded up the most significant changes below. Needless to say, spoilers ahead .\n\nBridgerton imagines a version of London in 1813 apparently free of racism, with a diverse aristocracy not found in the books. Two major characters who are presumably white on the page are played by Black actors: Regé-Jean Page as Simon Basset (whose \"icy blue\" eyes Quinn repeatedly emphasizes) and Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury. Bridgerton offers a canonical explanation for this casting, attributing the integration of the upper classes to the marriage of King George III and Queen Charlotte. There has been speculation that the historical Queen Charlotte may have had African ancestry ; the series accepts it as fact, casting Black actress Golda Rosheuvel as the queen and crediting her with changing the racial makeup of the ton by granting titles and land to other people of color.\n\nBridgerton opens with the fourth Bridgerton daughter (and oldest girl) making her debut before the queen, who pronounces her \"flawless.\" As a result, she becomes what Lady Whistledown calls the \"diamond of the season,\" sought after by men and envied by women. Despite having many suitors, Daphne's older brother Anthony drives them away by being overprotective, which leads Daphne to enter a fake relationship with Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, to once again boost her standing.\n\nIn The Duke and I , Daphne is in her second year on the marriage market, and far from being the \"diamond of the season,\" she is having trouble finding a good match because most eligible men see her as more of a friend. She turns down four proposals because of age or incompatibility, including Nigel Berbrooke (who is more of a bumbler than an outright villain in the books, though Daphne punches him in both anyway). She's certainly never involved with a prince, as she is on the show.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.\n\nAnthony (who is much more reasonable about his sister's prospects in the books than he is on screen) and Benedict each get love interests on Bridgerton who are loosely based on minor characters from the books. Siena Rosso is based on Maria Rosso, the opera singer who catches Anthony's attention in Book 2, The Viscount Who Loved Me , though they never have an intense relationship as they do in the show. Madame Delacroix, the dressmaker who fakes a French accent, is an original character. Season 1 ends with Anthony and Siena splitting up, but it will be interesting to see how Benedict's new relationship fares, considering he has a totally different love interest in Book 3, An Offer From a Gentleman .\n\nThe details of Simon's childhood are true to the book: He didn't speak until he was 4 years old, and his father was ashamed of his stutter. But Bridgerton gives Lady Danbury a larger role in his upbringing by making her a close friend of his mother's who oversees his education. In the book, that part is played by Nurse Hopkins.\n\nSimon also has a penchant for boxing on Bridgerton not seen in the books. His friends Will and Alice Mondrich are brand new characters.\n\nThe fundamental drama of the Simon-Daphne marriage is the same in The Duke and I and on Bridgerton : Daphne wants children, but Simon promised his dying father their line would end with him, out of spite. Simon tells Daphne he can't have children, and Daphne doesn't know exactly how babies are made, so she doesn't realize that Simon pulling out is the reason she won't get pregnant. When Daphne finally learns the truth, she gets on top of him the next time they have sex and prevents him from pulling out despite him telling her to \"wait,\" twice-a scene that has generated no shortage of controversy . The two then argue about Simon's deception.\n\nThe order of events and the scene itself are both very different (and even more disturbing) in Quinn's novel. First Daphne confronts Simon about his deception and refuses to sleep with him again, at which point he threatens to rape her, reminding her that he \"owns\" her, though he ultimately leaves. Later, he revisits her room drunk, and when he's still half-asleep, she takes advantage and forces him to ejaculate inside her. It's also notable that at this point Simon knows Daphne doesn't understand how babies are made, whereas on the show Simon insists he had no idea the extent of her ignorance.\n\nIn the books, Mrs. Featherington is already a widow, but Bridgerton gives her a living husband with a gambling addiction. Then he (seemingly) dies at the end of the first season, leaving the family in financial jeopardy. This also provides a cliffhanger that isn't in the books: Who will inherit Lord Featherington's estate after his death? Based on Mrs. Featherington's reaction, someone bad.\n\nPoor Marina can't catch a break on the page or the screen. On Bridgerton , she is a cousin of the Featheringtons who is sent to London despite being in love with a soldier, George Crane, and secretly pregnant with his child. When he stops responding to her letters, Marina is forced to find a hasty match to save her reputation. When that fails, she unsuccessfully attempts to end the pregnancy. She eventually learns that George stopped responding not because he rejected her, as Mrs. Featherington made her believe, but because he died. Marina receives a proposal from George's brother in the name of honor rather than love. The last time we see her, she's off to reluctantly start her new life with Sir Phillip Crane.\n\nIn the books, Marina was indeed married to a Sir Phillip Crane after the death of his brother.

      "text": "The Biggest Differences Between Bridgerton and the Book Series That Inspired It\n\nThe eight-episode first season of Netflix's Bridgerton covers roughly the same time frame as The Duke and I , the first book in Julia Quinn's romance series. However, the Shonda Rhimes-produced drama also borrows plotlines from the other seven books in the series-and takes quite a few liberties with its source material along the way. We've rounded up the most significant changes below. Needless to say, spoilers ahead .\n\nBridgerton imagines a version of London in 1813 apparently free of racism, with a diverse aristocracy not found in the books. Two major characters who are presumably white on the page are played by Black actors: Regé-Jean Page as Simon Basset (whose \"icy blue\" eyes Quinn repeatedly emphasizes) and Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury. Bridgerton offers a canonical explanation for this casting, attributing the integration of the upper classes to the marriage of King George III and Queen Charlotte. There has been speculation that the historical Queen Charlotte may have had African ancestry ; the series accepts it as fact, casting Black actress Golda Rosheuvel as the queen and crediting her with changing the racial makeup of the ton by granting titles and land to other people of color.\n\nBridgerton opens with the fourth Bridgerton daughter (and oldest girl) making her debut before the queen, who pronounces her \"flawless.\" As a result, she becomes what Lady Whistledown calls the \"diamond of the season,\" sought after by men and envied by women. Despite having many suitors, Daphne's older brother Anthony drives them away by being overprotective, which leads Daphne to enter a fake relationship with Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, to once again boost her standing.\n\nIn The Duke and I , Daphne is in her second year on the marriage market, and far from being the \"diamond of the season,\" she is having trouble finding a good match because most eligible men see her as more of a friend. She turns down four proposals because of age or incompatibility, including Nigel Berbrooke (who is more of a bumbler than an outright villain in the books, though Daphne punches him in both anyway). She's certainly never involved with a prince, as she is on the show.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.\n\nAnthony (who is much more reasonable about his sister's prospects in the books than he is on screen) and Benedict each get love interests on Bridgerton who are loosely based on minor characters from the books. Siena Rosso is based on Maria Rosso, the opera singer who catches Anthony's attention in Book 2, The Viscount Who Loved Me , though they never have an intense relationship as they do in the show. Madame Delacroix, the dressmaker who fakes a French accent, is an original character. Season 1 ends with Anthony and Siena splitting up, but it will be interesting to see how Benedict's new relationship fares, considering he has a totally different love interest in Book 3, An Offer From a Gentleman .\n\nThe details of Simon's childhood are true to the book: He didn't speak until he was 4 years old, and his father was ashamed of his stutter. But Bridgerton gives Lady Danbury a larger role in his upbringing by making her a close friend of his mother's who oversees his education. In the book, that part is played by Nurse Hopkins.\n\nSimon also has a penchant for boxing on Bridgerton not seen in the books. His friends Will and Alice Mondrich are brand new characters.\n\nThe fundamental drama of the Simon-Daphne marriage is the same in The Duke and I and on Bridgerton : Daphne wants children, but Simon promised his dying father their line would end with him, out of spite. Simon tells Daphne he can't have children, and Daphne doesn't know exactly how babies are made, so she doesn't realize that Simon pulling out is the reason she won't get pregnant. When Daphne finally learns the truth, she gets on top of him the next time they have sex and prevents him from pulling out despite him telling her to \"wait,\" twice-a scene that has generated no shortage of controversy . The two then argue about Simon's deception.\n\nThe order of events and the scene itself are both very different (and even more disturbing) in Quinn's novel. First Daphne confronts Simon about his deception and refuses to sleep with him again, at which point he threatens to rape her, reminding her that he \"owns\" her, though he ultimately leaves. Later, he revisits her room drunk, and when he's still half-asleep, she takes advantage and forces him to ejaculate inside her. It's also notable that at this point Simon knows Daphne doesn't understand how babies are made, whereas on the show Simon insists he had no idea the extent of her ignorance.\n\nIn the books, Mrs. Featherington is already a widow, but Bridgerton gives her a living husband with a gambling addiction. Then he (seemingly) dies at the end of the first season, leaving the family in financial jeopardy. This also provides a cliffhanger that isn't in the books: Who will inherit Lord Featherington's estate after his death? Based on Mrs. Featherington's reaction, someone bad.\n\nPoor Marina can't catch a break on the page or the screen. On Bridgerton , she is a cousin of the Featheringtons who is sent to London despite being in love with a soldier, George Crane, and secretly pregnant with his child. When he stops responding to her letters, Marina is forced to find a hasty match to save her reputation. When that fails, she unsuccessfully attempts to end the pregnancy. She eventually learns that George stopped responding not because he rejected her, as Mrs. Featherington made her believe, but because he died. Marina receives a proposal from George's brother in the name of honor rather than love. The last time we see her, she's off to reluctantly start her new life with Sir Phillip Crane.\n\nIn the books, Marina was indeed married to a Sir Phillip Crane after the death of his brother. But we never truly get to know Marina as a character, since she is already dead following a suicide attempt by the fifth book, To Sir Phillip, With Love , when Eloise and Sir Phillip begin a relationship via letters.

That's as much as I can say without giving anything away, but don't worry, the heroine does not leave her man for a bee, unlike in a certain movie , nor does the male lead think he's a bee , as in another certain movie .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Review: 'Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story' delivers extravagantly eye-popping entertainment\n\nAfter only two seasons, the series \"Bridgerton\" has spawned a prequel.\n\nAfter only two seasons of the racy Shonda Rhimes series, \"Bridgerton\" has already spawned a prequel -- and lucky for Netflix viewers, the six episodes that start streaming this week are brimming over with delicious delights and wicked intrigue. As local gossip Lady Whistledown, impeccably voiced by Julie Andrews, might put it to her dear readers, \"All's fair in love and war.\"\n\nRest assured, there's plenty of both and an unexpected touch of real-life gravity in \"Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\" Here's just the origin story we need as the young Charlotte (India Amarteifio in a star-making performance) meets and marries England's gorgeous King George III (Corey Mylchreest with cheekbones for days) only to learn his shocking secrets.\n\nBut let's not rush. The series is framed by scenes of the mature Queen Charlotte (the indelibly imperious Golda Rosheuvel) facing royal pressure to marry off at least one of her 13 children to produce an heir. It's that pressure that sparks the queen to consider her youth.\n\nCut to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Germany, who is only 17 when she arrives in court with her brother Adolphus (Tunji Kasim) for an arranged marriage to George, then 23. She's dreading the moment so much that she's trying to climb over a wall when George approaches her in a garden without telling her who he is. His charm and looks disarm her. And us.\n\nSo far so Shondaland, but \"Queen Charlotte\" breaks tradition by marrying fantasy to actual history. That's a first. Charlotte does not appear in the Bridgerton books written by Julia Quinn. But she was indeed real and believed to be the first British Queen of Black ancestry.\n\nDespite her attraction to the king, Charlotte is appalled when he leaves her on their wedding night to isolate at another castle. His reason? A mental instability close to manic-depression that made him fear having children. Later, Charlotte slyly sidesteps George's quack doctors and his controlling mother (Michelle Fairley) to work out a relationship with this shy man she loves.\n\nThis story has been told onstage and in the Oscar-nominated 1994 film \"The Madness of King George,\" starring Nigel Hawthorne and Helen Mirren. The more fanciful \"Bridgerton\" version depicts a parliament-launched \"Great Experiment,\" in which land and titles are bestowed on people of color to render interracial marriage -- shades of Harry and Meghan -- no big deal.\n\nFascinating stuff, as is the secret same-sex affair between the king's valet, Reynolds (Freddie Dennis), and the queen's right-hand man, Brimsley (Sam Clemmett). But the union that truly resonates here is between the queen and her chief confidante Lady Danbury, played with fire in youth (Arsema Thomas) and age (Adjoa Andoh). Both actresses are dynamite.\n\nAbove all, \"Queen Charlotte\" celebrates the long-lasting bond between Charlotte and George. The intimate details remain lost to history, especially when George's condition worsened in the final years of his reign. Leave it to Team \"Bridgerton\" to fill in the gaps with Amarteifio and Mylchreest bringing such heat and heart to their roles that you'll be swooning.\n\nRhimes and \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Chris Van Dusen had a goal: \"We knew we wanted the show to reflect the world we live in today, and even though it's set in the 19th century, we still want modern audiences to relate to it and see themselves on screen.\"\n\nThe friskier challenge is to do all that while still making good on the \"Bridgerton\" promise to deliver sexy, sumptuous, extravagantly eye-popping entertainment. On those grounds, gentle readers, you need have no doubt.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Review: 'Bridgerton Season 2' brims over with smoldering romance and unexpected edge\n\nThe hit Netflix show is back for a second season of steamy romance.\n\nNot so fast. That's my answer for \"Bridgerton\" doubters who think season two -- now streaming on Netflix -- doesn't stand a chance in hell without the presence of season-one sex magnet Regé-Jean Page as the impossibly beautiful Duke of Hastings whose fiery affair with Bridgerton daughter Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) kept 82 million COVID shut-ins panting for more.\n\nThough the now-married Daphne shows up in the latest \"Bridgerton,\" along with her infant son, the duke does not. I know it hurts, but suck it up.\n\nJulia Quinn wrote eight romance novels about this Regency-era family of Londoners who, from 1813 to 1827, hopped from opulent balls to bedrooms with gossip queen Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews) keeping score.\n\nTake my word, dear reader, that producer Shonda Rhimes and showrunner Chris Van Dusen do not disappoint, making sure that season two, entitled \"The Viscount Who Loved Me,\" brims over with sumptuous spectacle, eye-popping costumes, smoldering romance and unexpected edge.\n\nThe focus now falls on Daphne's elder brother, Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, played by hunk-in-waiting Jonathan Bailey, a dynamite actor equally adept at drama (\"Broadchurch\") and musicals -- his recent stage role as a nervous groom-to-be in \"Company\" won him an Olivier Award for navigating the show-stopping tongue-twister \"Not Getting Married Today.\"\n\nMarriage also has Anthony in a twist. Though once a frequenter of London's finer brothels, the viscount needs a proper wife to suit his nobility. So he pays careful attention when Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) picks her favorite, the \"diamond,\" for the upcoming social season.\n\nThe jewel is beautiful Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran) in from Bombay and a protégé of the queen's confidante, Lady Danbury (the imperious Adjoa Andoh). But first Anthony must get past Edwina's overprotective older sister, Kate (Simone Ashley), deemed a spinster at 26.\n\nKate, right out of Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" takes an instant dislike to the viscount after overhearing his toxic, masculine views on marriage as a strictly financial proposition. Suddenly, Kate and the viscount are doing their own version of Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice,\" falling in love even while they're hating on each other.\n\nOK, you've seen it before. Opposites also attracted Daphne and the duke last season. But none of it matters when you're having this much fun.\n\nWhether Kate and the viscount are dancing to orchestral arrangements of Madonna's \"Material Girl,\" one-upping each other on horseback or getting sweaty in a croquet match, Bailey and Ashley ignite their own brand of fireworks.\n\nThe best subplot involves the viscount's rebellious sister Eloise (a terrific Claudia Jessie), a fledgling feminist who bolts from her debutante debut and talks women's rights with her bestie, Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). We know from last season that Pen is the real Lady Whistledown. But no one else does, and Eloise is determined to play detective.\n\nKudos to season two for digging deeper into the emotional lives of its characters and continuing the colorblind casting that creates a utopia in which diversity is so ingrained it's hardly worth a mention. Everyone, however, is still vying for money and position, so no one is perfect.\n\nAnd so, this second helping of \"Bridgerton,\" despite a few lags in its midsection, offers up more than a deliciously pretty surface. By satirizing the modern implications of a predatory society, from the fat-shaming of Pen to the rise of the one-percenters, this series knocks the stuffing out of costume drama to reflect the best and worst of human behavior through the ages.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "'Bridgerton' is back, and I think I'm in love\n\nEditor's Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweets @HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nIn incredible news for everyone who has found the last year and three months since season 1 came out a bit much, \" Bridgerton \" is back.\n\nIn tragic news for my mum, Regé-Jean Page - aka Daphne Briderton's new husband and reluctant baby daddy, the Duke - isn't returning with it. Fans will have to make do with Anthony Bridgerton, Daphne's hotheaded eldest brother played by Jonathan Bailey, as their new leading man.\n\nIn this sophomore season , Anthony takes center stage, as of course does his love life. This focuses quickly on two sisters, Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who is the season's belle and therefore the ideal choice, and the older, marriage-averse Kate (Simone Ashley), to whom the Viscount Bridgerton is naturally, immediately attracted. Having spent season 1 either in bed with his now-ex girlfriend or channeling his frustrations at their forced estrangement by dueling his best friend, Anthony has sworn off romance in favor of a resigned, clinical approach to marriage. With the prospects of his younger siblings to consider, he has vowed to find a mate appropriate to care for them and the future Bridgerton line - a choice that must be weighed independently of love. It's a fluffy, addictive, entirely watchable disaster waiting to happen.\n\nAnthony was the bad boy in season 1, in many ways the shagging, chaotic, antithesis of the stoic, simmering Duke. Every time I watched the show, at least one viewing companion would huff when Anthony came on screen, dismissing \"that prick\" before heaving a gratified sigh upon the Duke's next appearance. It was an understandable response. What indeed would be the point of a show whose entire m.o. is sensory overload , if we didn't embrace Page's concupiscent allure?\n\nIn the extenuatory spirit of \"Bridgerton,\" however, I think it's worth giving Anthony a little more credit - or, at the very least, enough to justify our inevitable transference of affections this spring. It's a low bar, but Anthony isn't actually more problematic than the hero of season 1 - and doesn't benefit from the years of Regency romance novel programming that, I'd argue, largely explain the audience's more immediate sympathy for the Duke.\n\nWhile the Duke is a distracting, enticing fantasy, Anthony is essentially making it up as he goes along, masking his passions and fears behind bravado and stomping. Unlike the most famous Regency heroes, the \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Emma\" crowd who tend to be passively courted by mothers and daughters determined to snag advantageous matches, or harbor depths utterly at odds with the face they show the world, Anthony wears his goal plainly, crassly on his sleeve, and has set about fulfilling it himself.\n\nThe Duke's habitual silence and harboring of secret demons very much fits the Mr. Darcy-style template every Jane Austen fan is hardwired to eat up. We're primed to anticipate his redemption and ultimate union with Daphne, so we view his behavior leading up to that point charitably. He lies about the reason he won't have kids? Of course he does, his dad was mean to him! Gaslights the woman who loves him when she calls him on that lie? He'll make it up to her! Characterizes the barest hints about masturbation as a full debrief on sex and reproduction? He did his best! And he looked incredible!\n\nPoor old Anthony is messier. While the Duke's \"rakish\" past is primly referred to in gentlemen's clubs and during \"promenades\" in the park, our first introduction to Anthony sees him making vigorous love to a woman against a tree. We don't learn until later that she's his girlfriend Siena, who he secretly supports financially. Anthony's lust is framed from the get-go as an evasion of responsibility, while the Duke's is just part of his red-blooded charm.\n\nThough both men initially eschew marriage, Anthony's relationship to the institution is more authentically tortured than the Duke's in season 1 - his own mother's great love with his now-dead father looms over the action like an ideal he fears he can never live up to. As the show proceeds, Anthony's lack of any recognizable endgame exposes his flaws in a far harsher light than the Duke. But though he also acts clumsily on selfish impulses, Anthony is much more honest about his feelings and motivations.\n\nWhen the Duke appears to have taken up with Daphne, Anthony tells him that though they're good friends, family has to come first - and he's just not keen on his little sis dating someone he knows to be a total, ahem, \"rake\" during her all-important first season. After he challenges the Duke to a duel, he goes right to Siena to give her the heads-up on his potential change of circumstances, and when it turns out he can't run away with her after all, he offers to support her anyway.\n\nThough he's constantly messing up, Anthony learns from (some) past mistakes - especially when it comes to letting Daphne choose her own mate and lecturing his younger brothers about their own romantic choices. He then gets a pretty rough deal when his mom orders him to give up Siena, even though she tells Daphne emphatically that she only cares about her marrying for love, but he shoulders it alone. His upfront, emotional approach in the first season having ended in heartbreak, and the fate of his family still weighing heavy on him as its head, it's no wonder Anthony is resigned to manage his life along more practical lines thereafter.\n\nIt's important at this juncture to stress just how rooted in fantasy \"Bridgerton\" is. It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country - one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th - has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. Lady Danbury, played by Adjoa Andoh, refers to the fact her family is accepted by society thanks to this unprecedented union - which doesn't really tally with its presumably long-established noble lineage, but sounds encouraging.\n\nRelated article How much of 'Bridgerton' is forgivable?\n\nAll this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love in this show. As far as its audience is concerned, Anthony should be no exception, not least because of how familiar he is. As a man - an early 19th century one at that - who is not allowed by society to show vulnerability, it's no wonder that his many insecurities manifest as arrogance.\n\nPrivileged, immature, impulsive, brain-in-their-pants Anthonys are everywhere. He's a damn sight more real than a romantic hero like the Duke, whose deceit is \"really understandable, when you think about it,\" and who improves if you just give him enough space. In real life, men who habitually lie by omission tend not to change. Half-grown guys like Anthony on the other hand, might - especially once they learn to communicate their emotions in a less explosive way. This would definitely take longer than a summer season in reality, but in magnolia-scented fictional Mayfair, anything is possible.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMen whose wealth and status have allowed them to do as they please their entire lives always remain emotionally infantile. Patriarchy hurts men too, albeit so much less than women, and it's inevitable that men who fall victim will turn other people into scratching posts for their confusion and frustrations. The glossy, candy-cane world of \"Bridgerton\" offers an infinitely safer forum for Anthony to work through his demons than real life might, but he's still a randy, confused man-child with seven siblings to father. And, as they would in real life, the classism, sexism and puritanical values that hurt everyone are hurting him too.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "In racism-free England of 'Bridgerton,' colonialism still lingers over Sharmas\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIn a quiet room, tucked away from the prying eyes and gossip of British high society, Kate Sharma massages oil into her little sister's thick, black hair.\n\nIt's a common practice among South Asians, one that conjures the smell of coconut oil and the feeling of a mother's hands weaving through her daughter's hair. These intimate, private moments are hardly ever seen in Western media, let alone in a series set in 1800s London.\n\nIt's a scene shared by Kate and Edwina Sharma (Simone Ashley and Charithra Chandran, respectively), two Indian characters added to the cast of \"Bridgerton\" in its second season. The eight-episode run, which debuted on Netflix last month, has deviated from the formula used in its previous iteration , in which the story existed in an England that was blind to race.\n\nWith the Sharmas' plotline, however, there are several references to an Indian backstory, including a professed love of chai, accents that seem to slip back and forth between British and Indian, and even nods to British imperialism.\n\nHarleen Singh, associate professor of women's studies and South Asian history at Brandeis University, said the inclusion of brown-skinned actresses such as Ashley and Chandran was significant in itself, and some of the cultural moments hit home. But with an under-researched use of language and a half-in, half-out approach to addressing race, there were areas where the new season fell short.\n\nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen the Sharma sisters, along with their mother, Mary, first enter the story, they've just traveled to London from Bombay, India (known as Mumbai since 1995), and are seeking to get Edwina married into British high society. Kate, whose single-minded mission is to find her sister a husband, presents Edwina's skills, including a mastery of two Indian languages: Hindustani and Marathi.\n\nBut there's a clear issue with this, Singh said. Marathi, supposedly their mother tongue, is spoken in central and South India.\n\n\"They're Sharmas,\" she said. \"They're from North India.\"\n\nThroughout the season, Edwina calls Kate \"didi,\" a Hindi term meaning older sister, yet they both refer to their deceased dad as \"appa,\" a South Indian name for father. Moreover, Kate calls Edwina \"bon,\" a Bengali word for sister.\n\n\"I'm a little annoyed,\" Singh said. \"Do your research. ... If you're going to cast Indian women, be specific. Are they from the North? Are they from the South? They say 'appa,' but then they say 'didi.' True representation actually lies in them making the effort to find out.\"\n\nWhile the Sharmas strolled onto the London social scene in the idealized world of \"Bridgerton,\" real-life 1800s Britain was setting the stage for colonialism in South Asia.\n\nThe show doesn't entirely shy away from addressing interactions between Brits and Indians on the subcontinent. Mary Sharma, played by Anglo Indian actress Shelley Conn, was notably rejected from English society after she married a poor Indian clerk.\n\nBut the show leaves out the violent and exploitative aspects of colonization.\n\n\"I think it's greatly flattened out,\" Singh said. \"During the Regency period that 'Bridgerton' is set in, the East India Company is in India. It's a corporate colonialism at this point.\"\n\nWhile white characters in \"Bridgerton\" tell Kate about their desire to travel to India to \"learn from\" things like Ayurvedic medical practice, the reality was much different. The East India Company, a British enterprise formed to trade over the Indian Ocean, exercised military force over much of South Asia and planted the seeds for colonialism.\n\nThough there were Indians in England at the time, they wouldn't have navigated social circles like the Sharmas did at all, Singh said.\n\n\"These relationships existed, but Indians within high society in England - conversing, traversing, moving in the same way, being a part of society, being debutantes - I find that highly unrealistic,\" she said. \"They would have faced an upheaval of racist and cultural stereotypes. They would not have been so easily accepted.\"\n\nWhile other actors of color - such as Adjoa Andoh, a Black actress who portrays noblewoman Lady Danbury in \"Bridgerton\" - are dropped into roles historically occupied by white people without race as a factor, the Sharmas' Indianness is explored a lot.\n\nSeason two reminds viewers of their background in every episode, but Singh said it neglects diving deeper.\n\n\"Shows like this, they're relying on a particular righteousness,\" she said. \"'We're doing the right thing, the right kind of representation.' And if you're going to do that, do the research.\"\n\nFor Singh, the most touching moments in the second season of \"Bridgerton\" didn't come from the dramatic love triangle between Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and the Sharma sisters, but in the smaller glimpses into the lives of each character.\n\nWhile some details were inaccurate, Singh said, there was comfort in seeing Kate and Edwina alone with their long, black braids cascading down their sides, sneaking cloves into English tea to make it more like chai or donning traditional jewelry.\n\n\"Just showing Indian women as the object of desire or conversation or love, we've done that 100 times before, and not always to good use,\" she said. \"But these things are intimate to our lives.\"\n\nThe most prominent moment came in episode six, with the three Indian women sitting together and participating in a traditional pre-wedding haldi ceremony. Mary and Kate apply a turmeric paste to Edwina's face on the eve of her big day, a ritual that's meant to bless the bride before her marriage.\n\nTraditional orange garlands decorate their room, and they conduct the ceremony with little exposition or explanation. A rendition of the classic Bollywood song \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\" plays in the background.\n\n\"I have faced a thousand tomorrows, but they've all been leading to this one,\" Edwina says, and her sister spreads haldi on her arms.\n\nLike many brown eldest daughters, Kate carries the family on her back, Singh said.\n\n\"The eldest does bear a kind of burden,\" she said. \"They have that caregiving, parental role. And that's something we see in 'Bridgerton.' She's kind of the architect of her sister's future.\"\n\nBeyond the inaccuracies, Singh said she still sees the magic in \"Bridgerton\" season two. It's a space that South Asian women seldom get to occupy and a familial relationship audiences rarely see.\n\n\"Those are the intimate parts of our lives,\" she said. \"I find these moments far more persuasive, far more moving. ... I hold out hope in the imagination of love stories.\"\n\nSakshi Venkatraman is a reporter for NBC Asian America.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

With a great (and very good-looking) cast, addictive romance and steamy scenes, \"Charlotte\" proves itself a worthy spinoff in its very first episode.\n\n\"Charlotte\" jumps back and forth in time during its six-episode season, alternating between the early 1800s \"Bridgerton\" era and young Charlotte's life a half-century earlier. The \"present\" timeline features Golda Rosheuvel reprising her \"Bridgerton\" role as the queen, along with other \"Bridgerton\" characters Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) and Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) and focuses on Charlotte's desire for one of her 15 children to produce a royal heir.\n\nIn the past, Charlotte (India Amarteifio) arrives in England, a German noblewoman unprepared for her new life as a queen and wife to the enigmatic King George III (Corey Mylchreest). With the help of young Lady Danbury (Arsema Thomas) and Charlotte's servant Brimsley (Sam Clemmett), the new queen begins to figure out how to relate to the British monarchy - and her husband. And maybe she actually falls in love with George along the way.\n\nRhimes wrote \"Charlotte,\" and longtime fans of her work can tell. (\"Bridgerton\" was created by Chris Van Dusen, a \"Grey's Anatomy\" alum). The story is set in a castle instead of a Seattle hospital, but there are sparks of what made the workplace romance and drama of \"Grey's\" so electrifying in \"Charlotte.\" Some of the plotting is overly complex, and our romantic heroes face oh-so-many roadblocks, but Rhimes knows how to make a will they/won't they relationship work. And yes, even though they're married in the first episode, the burning question in most of \"Charlotte\" is whether these crazy kids will get together for more than royal appearances.\n\nAmarteifio and Mylchreest have fantastic chemistry, and an episode focused on the pair, well, doing their royal duty amid anger and hate will leave romance fans absolutely delighted. And it's not just Charlotte and George who generate fireworks, but Brimsley and another royal servant (Freddie Dennis), along with other members of the court. And there are more than just characters to love: Rhimes has a great villain to hate in George's mother Princess Augusta, played with razor-sharp snobbery by \"Game of Thrones\" alum Michelle Fairley.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" imagines a racially integrated England in the Regency era, and ahistorically, \"Charlotte\" attempts to explain how that integration happened. It gives \"Charlotte\" the same kind of \"what might have happened\" plotting as alternate history fiction like \"The Man in the High Castle,\" and it's a fascinating bit of historical pondering. Much of that story is shouldered by the young Lady Danbury, played by revelatory young actress Thomas, who commands her every scene.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" premiered on Netflix in December 2020, and quickly became a phenomenon, and phenomena are notoriously hard to replicate. ( Season 2 of the original series had its detractors ). But \"Charlotte\" more than rises to the occasion. It's got the glitz, the gorgeous people and the gleefully seductive looks. The finale leaves a few plot threads dangling, and it seems like there are, if not infinite stories to tell out of the \"Bridgerton\" universe, then at least quite a few."

      "text": "'Bridgerton' isn't as progressive on race as it seems, and there's a clear reason why\n\nNetflix's \" Bridgerton \" gives viewers a different view of 1800s England - one with Black people in power.\n\nExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes ' first series for Netflix quickly resonated with subscribers after premiering on Christmas Day, so much so that it earned a Season 2 renewal on Thursday.\n\nBut viewers were also quick to address the issue of colorism - discrimination against people with darker skin tones.\n\nLighter-skinned Black characters on the show mostly hold positions of nobility and darker-skinned Black characters are relegated to the sidelines and appear villainous or violent.\n\n\"I want to watch (\"Bridgerton\") but the colorism is completely throwing me off,\" @MyNewEssence96 wrote on Twitter. @CamomilleKing wrote: \"I'm enjoying Bridgerton but it really is wild to me how many people are praising it without acknowledging it's colorism.\"\n\nExperts say that the show's colorism hinders meaningful inclusion for the Black community.\n\n\"It's almost as if the show didn't have enough of a belief in its own originality,\" Valerie Babb , a professor at Emory University. \"Why didn't it take the next step and allow darker characters of color to be more than background scenery, and to be part of the primary actors in the series?\"\n\nLighter-skinned Black characters include regal  Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) and Simon, the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page). Darker-skinned characters are typically minor and include Simon's father, who cruelly banished his son due to his stutter, (Richard Pepple) and boxer friend Will Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe).  USA TODAY has reached out to Netflix for comment.\n\nIt's a problem that could have been avoided. \"If they wanted to have a cast that was more diverse in terms of color hue, they could have,\" Deborah Whaley , a professor at the University of Iowa, says. She sees the casting decisions as \"as a failure and a misstep.\"\n\n\"I don't think that takes away from the quality of the show, but it definitely raises some concerns about the larger cultural impact it could have had if it was more attuned to those differences,\" she adds.\n\nIt may seem the show disregards the color of its characters' skin in favor of a \"colorblind\" approach, but the show addresses race head-on.\n\n\"We wanted our approach to race to go beyond mere representation,\" series creator Chris Van Dusen told USA TODAY in an interview last month. \"We wanted race and color to be a part of our text.\"\n\nIn one gripping scene about halfway through the eight-episode season, Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), who is darker-skinned than other prominent high-society Black characters, meaningfully discusses race in a conversation with Simon.\n\n\"We were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with one of us,\" she says. \"Love, your grace, conquers all.\" She's referring to a white King falling in love with a Black woman (now Queen Charlotte), changing history.\n\nIt is ultimately too saccharine, says Adilifu Nama , professor of African American studies at Loyola Marymount University.\n\n\"It's a very reductive analysis of race in history and the intertwining of those two. It reduces it down to a personal feeling,\" Nama explains.\n\nHe also notes that the lighter-skinned Black actors and actresses who have meaningful speaking roles - particularly the women - seem to look like they're of mixed ancestry.\n\n\"This strikes a chord with Black folk in America, in particular. It strikes a chord with us, given the historical past, coming out of enslavement that there was a mulatto elite that had the benefits of being in an advantageous position to be the leadership class in the Black community coming out of enslavement and during Jim Crow,\" Nama says.\n\nAnd even the light-skinned Black cast still suffers from stereotypes. Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker) is an unwed Black mother, something society has perceived as more common for Black women.\n\nBabb hopes the plot isn't as stereotypical moving forward.\n\nShe gives the show credit for reimagining Britain in a way that was more historically accurate , as it did have a strong Black presence, many of whom who were able to experience certain levels of privilege. (It's long been speculated that George III's wife, Queen Charlotte, was mixed-race).\n\nBut the show tries to take on too much, Nama says. \"At the end of the day, I think the success of the show is more bound to the success of the narrative, and the arc of the characters, rather than any type of racial commentary that it has to make,\" he says.\n\nHe adds: \"If you're going to incorporate race into your narrative, into your world-building, then the use of race should be a point of departure, not a point of continued examination.\" Why couldn't the queen be of a darker complexion, for example?\n\nNone of this means that \"Bridgerton\" should be \"canceled,\" per se. The show is not perfect, Nama says, but it's good and needs to get better.\n\n\"I think it is so important to just to really see the dangers in colorism and really see the ways that colorism reinforces the same old notion that says lighter is better,\" Babb says. \"We're just in a world that should be moving beyond that.\""

      "text": "Adjoa Andoh wants her 'Bridgerton' character, Lady Danbury, to find love\n\nManage your account\n\nLady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) may not be a lead character in \"Bridgerton, \" but she frequently steals the show with her wisdom and wry wit. In season two , the cane-wielding countess tries her best to mentor Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley) , who is caught in a love triangle with Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and her little sister, Edwina (Charithra Chandran).\n\nAlthough Lady Danbury's \"Bridgerton\" storylines typically see her matchmaking another couple into existence, Andoh tells TODAY that she would love for the wealthy widow to have a love interest of her own.\n\n\"Of course I would,\" she said. \"Just because you're over 40 doesn't mean that you don't still want a love interest in your life.\"\n\nBased on Lady Danbury's personality, Andoh can easily imagine the rest of her character's life (love life included).\n\n\"I think the great thing about Lady Danbury is she has a real appetite for life - and appetite in all its areas,\" Andoh continued, \"Whether it's a good cigarette, or a nice drink, or good food, or watching a game of sport, or having a dance, or getting a great new hat ... or having a sexy time with somebody who she's attracted to.\"\n\nSeason two of \"Bridgerton\" gives a glimpse into more of Lady Danbury's life, beyond her role as a meddler extraordinaire, when gives Kate a wake-up call about being a single woman in the Regency-era England.\n\nKate looks up to Lady Danbury for making her own way in a world that is often restrictive for women.\n\nBut in a dose of real talk, Lady Danbury tells Kate that she's only able to live so independently because she's a high-ranking widow with a title, and has \"earned the right\" to make her own choices. According to Lady Danbury, the only way Kate can possibly become like her is if she decides to marry. Essentially, Kate can't become a spinster and live calmly into the sunset, as she desires.\n\n\"(Kate) sees that Lady Danbury has made the success of her circumstances and that Lady Danbury is still in the game,\" Andoh said about Kate. \"Because sometimes if you push too hard you will just be pushed out of the game. And by that, I mean, the game of life.\"\n\nEven though Kate admires Lady Danbury's lifestyle, the fiery characters clash while trying to find Edwina a husband. In the process, Kate ignores her own feelings for Anthony Bridgerton, Edwina's suitor, leading to sexual tension and a destructive love triangle.\n\n\"I think Kate butts heads with Lady Danbury from a genuinely good-hearted place. But she is anxious to secure her younger sister's future and she's doing it in an incredibly selfless way because she's absolutely sidelined any notion of what she may have as a future,\" Andoh said about Kate putting her feelings for Anthony on the sidelines.\n\nFor Lady Danbury, Kate is creating a mess out of what should be a straightforward situation. The Sharmas are Lady Danbury's guests for the season, invited with the express purpose of finding Edwina a match.\n\n\"She gets that Kate wants to do best by her sister, but (she's like), 'Shut up, because I have been doing this for many years,\" Andoh said.\n\nLady Danbury has matchmaking down to a science, as she demonstrated when bringing Daphne Bridgerton together with Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, in season one. Kate, as becomes evident, is not as skilled.\n\n\"I know who, where, why, when, what, how we do it, when to blow hot, when to blow cool, and Kate's just coming in full in. It's like, you're coming in full in, you're a stranger,\" she said, of Lady Danbury's perspective. \"You're living on my dollar. So just back off and let me support you because we're both wanting the same things. We want to secure a good future for her sister.\"\n\nAndoh said that even though the two sometimes don't get along, Lady Danbury still admires Kate. She sees echoes of herself in the \"Bridgerton\" newcomer. \"Lady Danbury also sees that hot, young element of herself in Kate when she was making her way in the world,\" she said.\n\nLady Danbury eventually must leave to Kate make her own fumbles - just as Andoh does with her own children.\n\n\"It's the thing I do with my kids. You want to go, 'Honestly, darling, don't do that.' At a certain point, you have to go, 'Do you know what? They're going to make their own mistakes because that is how we are,'\" Andoh said.\n\nOnly through Lady Danbury taking a backseat can Kate learn her lesson - a fact of life, for Andoh. \"Even though the people who love you want to keep your feet out of the fire and stop you from falling under the bus, at a certain point, you maybe have to get burned once to understand that it's hot, and you need to avoid it,\" she added.\n\nStill, the road to a resolution is messy, and Lady Danbury bears witness to one of its most climactic moments. At her wedding to Anthony, Edwina realizes that her to-be-husband loved her sister, Kate, all along. She ends up calling off the wedding at the aisle, a bold move that made Lady Danbury and Lady Bridgerton didn't anticipate from the seemingly demure young lady.\n\nAfter bringing Edwina and Anthony closer together the whole season, the two widows couldn't help but throw their heads back and laugh at how their efforts turned out.\n\nAndoh said that moment was very important because Lady Danbury finally found herself \"at a loss.\" That isn't something that happens often.\n\n\"She says, 'For the first time in my life, I don't know what to do,'\" Andoh said. \"That's a big confession from Lady Danbury. (Lady Bridgerton) is somebody she feels safe to make the confession with.\"\n\n\"It's like, I'm out of ideas now. So all they can do is laugh and they do and then once they start, they're hysterical,\" she continued. \"Sometimes, you're either going to laugh or you're going to cry. So you might as well laugh,\" Andoh added.\n\nAfter successfully bringing yet another happy couple to the aisle, Lady Danbury's time in \"Bridgerton\" is not over. As the other six Bridgerton siblings embark on quests for love in future seasons (including the confirmed third season ), they'll certainly need guidance and gentle nudges, as Daphne and Anthony did.\n\nIn fact, Lady Danbury will one day be related to her friend Lady Bridgerton through marriage. Her grandson Gareth figures into Hyacinth's love story. If you just can't wait, read Quinn's book \"It's in His Kiss.\" Lady Danbury won't tell, and neither will we."

As he did in previous PBS exploits - \"Conquistadors\" and \"In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great\" - Wood travels to some of the globe's most remote spots to penetrate the sources and continued vitality of these accounts.\n\nThe series opens with a haunting mission into Africa and Arabia, following the trails of the Sheba story. For the most part, Wood doesn't rely on the reenactment style of storytelling that has become de rigueur in historical documentaries. Instead, he utilizes the voices of locals to bring the past to life and reveal how much meaning the stories still have today.\n\nThere are exceptions. Four actresses recant the myths at various moments. In the Sheba segment, a black British actress, Adjoa Andoh, recites the encounters between Sheba and Solomon from Ethiopian holy works, underlining Wood's conviction that Sheba was a black African, not the white woman familiar from Hollywood movies.\n\n\"We toyed with the idea of actually picking up the storytellers on location,\" he says, \"but we wanted them to be plain, straight, clear, and in the English language.\"\n\nThe show's informal approach was often born of necessity. Wood's team didn't have permission to film in Tibet or China for the episode about Shangri-La, for example, so they proceeded under the guise of being tourists. But the style works well, inviting viewers to share the excitement of discovery as when Wood visits Ethiopia and finds the oldest copy of the story of Solomon, as read by an African in an ancient tongue.\n\nWood says this series is focused on the underlying potency of the themes in each tale and their resonance across the ages. \"There is a kind of search for the possible history behind the story,\" he says, but what really matters \"is the power of a story that has been told over thousands of years.\"\n\nWood may not have selected the four most important stories in mythical history, but he says his choices represent what he calls the four pillars of mythical storytelling. \"Jason is the story of a hero's quest, the young man who goes on the mission impossible,\" he says. The Shangri-La tale is a paradise myth, while the Arthurian legends and the accounts of Sheba and Solomon make up the foundation myths of such nations as Great Britain, Ethiopia, and Israel.\n\n\"You realize that history can become myth,\" he says. \"We all depend on myths in the modern world today. These myths are used to give a kind of focus to history and identity.\"\n\nMost Westerners will find themselves pondering this truth during the Sheba sequence as Wood tries, without success, to visit a humble - but well-protected - dwelling in Ethiopia that is reputed to house the Ark of the Covenant. Nevermind Hollywood's own mythmaking in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" says Wood. The story is different here. No Ethiopian believes that the Ark of the Covenant isn't inside that building, he says.\n\n• \"In Search of Myths and Heroes\" airs on PBS stations in two parts, Nov. 16 and 23.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

(The second season premieres March 20, 2022.) But when author Vanessa Riley encountered the novel, she became more than a fan. One of its minor characters not only stood out to her, but changed the direction of her career.\n\nAusten's Georgiana Lambe is an elegant, wealthy, biracial heiress who travels from the West Indies to the fictional seaside resort of Sanditon. Miss Lambe is enigmatic, and Austen's narrator describes her as precious, \"always of the first consequence,\" and \"chilly and tender.\"\n\nDr. Riley immediately took notice. Her own heritage is of the West Indies - Trinidad and Tobago - and South Carolina. And along with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, she has a repertoire of novels in the romance and historical fiction genres that elucidate the stories and histories of women of color.\n\nAs historians unearth the stories of Black lives in British colonial times, novelists are lending imagination and romance to the effort. For author Vanessa Riley, creating full-blown characters is critical to righting the historical record.\n\n\"Where are my people? And where's the representation?\" Dr. Riley says she's often asked herself those questions when reading Regency and historical fiction, especially considering the enormous financial underpinnings of commodities like sugar and cotton, and the labor of enslaved people, that fueled 18th- and 19th-century colonialism.\n\n\"And yet you read romance, you read a lot of historical fiction, and this is not mentioned,\" she says during a recent Zoom interview.\n\nAs historians unearth stories of Black lives of the Regency and 18th and 19th centuries, novelists like Dr. Riley are adding works of imagination, with stories featuring adventure and love. The combination offers not only a more accurate understanding of the past but a more three-dimensional view of human experience, both factual and fictional.\n\nWhen she encountered Miss Lambe, Dr. Riley says she felt driven by a pressing question: Was Austen being consciously progressive? Or was she simply describing the world she saw?\n\nWhile the answer contains a little of both, for Dr. Riley it was the search that mattered, leading to a discovery of real Black women's lives from British colonial and Regency eras.\n\nFor Dr. Riley, one life in particular - that of Dorothy Kirwan Thomas - stoked her imagination. She found that Thomas was born to an Irish plantation owner and an enslaved woman in Montserrat but had become a wealthy, influential person by the time she died in 1846, having lived at least into her 80s. Known as \"the Queen of Demerara\" (part of present-day Guyana), she's thought to have had 10 children and multiple grandchildren, some of whom were privately educated in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe more she learned, the more Dr. Riley was hooked. In fact, Thomas is the basis for her latest novel, \"Island Queen,\" published in July, which spans Thomas' life, encompassing her beginnings in slavery and chronicling her journey to achieve freedom and a business empire, all while shepherding a huge family across countries, islands, and continents.\n\n\"This woman is phenomenal,\" Dr. Riley says, \"that she's able to just restart her life in these various colonies. She does it with children!\"\n\n\"Some of us have struggles taking our kids to Walmart in the backseat of a minivan,\" laughs Dr. Riley, \"and she's taking 17 [children and grandchildren] from Demerara ... all the way up to Glasgow, Scotland. Because of this world of money that has opened up the world to her, she wants her grandkids to see this. And to feel this. And she's paying for the education of these children. And she's funding schools for the education of colored girls in London.\"\n\nAn avid reader of Regency romance, Dr. Riley wondered why she hadn't encountered entrepreneurial women of color beating the odds in colonial islands before.\n\n\"I mean, this is an enormously fabulous woman who rose against all kinds of odds,\" says Dr. Riley. \"For her to be completely wiped off the books just blows my mind.\"\n\nThat same bafflement drove Gretchen Gerzina's research. The real-life stories of women of color in the Regency era are not always easy to find, even for trained historians like Dr. Gerzina, who has teased out histories from fragments and written books and BBC radio programs documenting Black lives in historic Britain.\n\n\"I wanted to make people see ... that these people are walking the same streets, we're living in the same neighborhoods, and I wanted to make it a living, breathing history,\" Dr. Gerzina said on \"The Austen Connection\" podcast in July. \"People didn't quite realize that there had been a Black British history that goes back as far as the Romans. ... So it's become quite a well-known issue now. Although there's still a great sense of many British people wanting not to understand or believe that past.\"\n\nDr. Riley says Dr. Gerzina's work inspired her as she dug for Thomas' history, drawing on scraps - wills, historic newspaper reports, and legal records - to reconstruct her life. But there is much more work to be done in documenting the real lives of women of color, specifically in the West Indian colonies, she says.\n\nWriting Thomas' reconstructed life involves a lot of active words not usually associated with women of color under 18th-century colonial oppressions: words like entrepreneurship, manumission, agency, and status.\n\nAlso present - importantly for Dr. Riley - are love, romance, and \"happy ever after.\"\n\nThomas' life is adventurous, including her fascinating relationships with men - possibly even one with a sea captain prince who would later become England's King William IV. Such experiences, woven into Dr. Riley's book, make it highly romantic reading, and an awful lot of fun.\n\nBut Dr. Riley says despite the adventure, she resists the urge to make Thomas superhuman. She wants readers to see a real person in all her complexity, including the pain Thomas endured and the compromises she made, like owning and profiting from enslaved people as her businesses and influence expanded.\n\n\"Dorothy was very human,\" says Dr. Riley. \"She felt a lot of pain. She went through a lot of suffering, but she had a will to survive that I haven't read about for a long, long time.\"\n\nReaders looking for Regency adventures on the screen might not be surprised, especially after the record-breaking success of the Netflix/Shondaland series \"Bridgerton,\" that \"Island Queen\" has been optioned for the screen. Dr. Riley confirmed reports that \"Bridgerton\" director Julie Anne Robinson and star Adjoa Andoh have optioned the movie rights to the novel.\n\nA \"Bridgerton\" fan, Dr. Riley says flipping the script of the usual narrative of pain, putting a free woman of color at the center of the narrative, and making that narrative romantic and joyful give the story its power.\n\nShe says she never thought she'd get a chance to tell this story, precisely because it's a historic tale where pleasure overwhelms the pain. For a long time, she adds, publishers expected and seemed to commission stories featuring Black pain. But she feels a turning point occurred in May 2020.\n\n\"Something happened, something changed, and unfortunately we can trace it to George Floyd,\" she says.\n\nDr. Riley finds the publishing business more open to complex and true narratives now, so she is channeling her passion for Regency era stories into illuminating, through historical fiction, the real lives of historic women of color, even when those histories are hard.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Translated from the Italian, it details a childhood in Somalia made increasingly difficult under a strict Muslim regime and continues to the 2008 Olympics, where Omar ran as part of a two-person delegation. Trying desperately to flee Somalia for a country where she could be properly trained, fed, and allowed to run freely, she drowned in the Mediterranean after a harrowing and lengthy journey. Andoh's Somali accent is thick and overly dramatic, which was unnecessary considering the difficult and emotional material, which desperately needed a lighter touch.

Adjoa Andoh, a British actress, offers up various voices and lyrical African accents that are more realistic than her American accents, which sound strained. Grade: B+\n\nAlready a subscriber?

(L to R) Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton in ... More episode 303 of Bridgerton. Cr.\n\nThe emotional, steamy, and dramatic second part of Bridgerton Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix. If you have already binge-watched the final four episodes, you're likely wondering when the beloved regal drama will grace your screens again .\n\nWill there be a Bridgerton Season 4? Which Bridgerton sibling's love story will unfold next? These are the burning questions on every fan's mind following the eventful conclusion of Colin and Penelope's season. Thankfully, we have some answers - though other plot details remain tightly under wraps.\n\nWhen showrunner Jess Brownell took over for Season 3, she switched things up when she decided to tell Colin and Penelope's story - the fourth book in Julia Quinn's series - in the third season. Moving forward, any Bridgerton sibling (whose story hasn't been told already) could be next - but it will likely be the older siblings (sorry, Hyacinth and Gregory).\n\n\"I mean, if we're allowed to do eight seasons, like we hope - I know what order I would like to go in through Season 8. Whether or not that will happen, I'm not the only person who gets to decide that,\" Brownell recently told Decider .\n\nWill Season 4 focus on Benedict and Sophie's Cinderella romance? Or will Eloise start writing love letters to Sir Phillip Crane? Perhaps it's time for Francesca, John, and Michaela to shine, especially following the latter two's introduction in Season 3.\n\nHere's everything to know about Season 4 so far.\n\nBridgerton. Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton in episode 301 of Bridgerton.\n\nYes, Netflix renewed Bridgerton for a third and fourth season in April 2021. While Season 3 focused on Penelope and Colin's love story, the fourth season will focus on an entirely different Bridgerton sibling.\n\nBridgerton. (L to R) Claudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton, Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, ... More Simone Ashley as Kate Sharma, Will Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton, Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton, Jonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton, Florence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton in episode 301 of Bridgerton.\n\nNetflix has not announced which Bridgerton sibling will be the focus of the next season. Some fans have suspected that Francesca (portrayed by Hannah Dodd) will be next because of the recent introduction of John and Michaela Stirling, but Season 4 could also focus on Eloise or Benedict.\n\nBrownell also told Decider that \"Francesca's story, at least in this season is the main one that we are setting up for later down the line.\" She continued, \"Francesca's book, for those who are familiar, it takes place over a longer amount of years and it has more twists and turns. And so we felt like we wanted to start that story earlier so that we could play out more chapters of her book.\"\n\nBrownell's recent remarks that Francesca's story will be shared at a later time hint that Eloise or Benedict are most likely next in line.\n\nBridgerton. (L to R) Luke Newton as Colin Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington in ... More episode 301 of Bridgerton.\n\nTwo Bridgerton stars are already confirmed to return for Season 4. Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton will both be reprising their roles for the fourth season, the Irish actress revealed to The Wrap in May.\n\n\"They've told us we're back for season four, which is super lovely ... It'll be exciting,\" Coughlan said. \"[We'll] pop back and have some fun for sure.\" The actress added that she and Newton have not yet seen the scripts for Season 4. \"We don't know anything about it.\"\n\nAlthough Netflix hasn't confirmed the full cast list, it's safe to assume that season regulars Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury), Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte), Ruth Gemmell (Violet Bridgerton), Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), Luke Thompson (Benedict Bridgerton) and Hannah Dodd (Francesca Bridgerton), will all be back for Season 4.\n\nBridgerton. Adjoa Andoh as Lady Agatha Danbury in episode 302 of Bridgerton.\n\nNetflix has not announced a release date for Season 4. Showrunner Jess Brownell recently said it will likely take two years for the next season to arrive on Netflix - so sometime in 2026.\n\n\"We are working to try and put the seasons out more quickly, but they do take eight months to film and then they have to be edited, and then they have to be dubbed into every language,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter in June. \"And the writing takes a very long time as well, so we're kind of on a two-year pace, we're trying to speed up, but somewhere in that range.\"\n\nBrownell confirmed to Refinery29 that they were \"in the middle of writing it [season four]\" in May. \"We're still making sure that we write the best possible script that we can before we start production,\" she said. \"We actually don't know when it's gonna drop. We're still making sure that we write the best possible script that we can before we start production.\"\n\nBridgerton Season 3 is streaming on Netflix.

      "text": "'Bridgerton' Season 4? Netflix Will Likely Reach Bridgerton Season 8 In 2034\n\nBy Paul Tassi\n\nBy Paul Tassi ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nBridgerton\n\nFans unfortunately will have to wait another two years for Bridgerton season 4 now that season 3 has ended, as its showrunner confirmed that's the schedule they're now on. But with Bridgerton, it's a bit of a different story with its massive amount of source material to draw on, eight mainline books plus others to adapt.\n\nRight now, we should season Bridgerton season 2 in summer/early fall 2026. But that's four books, and with eight books total that looks like on the two year schedule:\n\nSo that would be literally a decade from now to get through all eight books, and the series started in 2020, so that would be 14 years total. It's not unheard of for shows to run eight seasons or 15 years, but in the streaming era, this would be unique. There is no reason to think Netflix would ever cancel the show before it finished these books, given that it greenlit both seasons 3 and 4 when season 2 hadn't even been released yet. What's four more seasons after that with this kind of viewership?\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThere are of course other Bridgerton books to adapt. We have already seen this happen once with Queen Charlotte, which is actually the best-reviewed season of the overall series.\n\nBridgerton. (L to R) Adjoa Andoh as Lady Agatha Danbury, Daniel Francis as Lord Anderson in episode ... More 306 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2024\n\nThere are four prequel books to adapt as well:\n\nEach of those could likely be a season. They are not small novellas, they are full books and all almost 400 pages each. They could theoretically be threaded in between seasons like Queen Charlotte was, a parallel timeline perhaps run by a different crew while the current showrunner worked on the main series. I kind of fully expect this to happen. There are also standalone books, similar to Queen Charlotte, like The Bridgertons: Happily Ever After and a graphic novel, Miss Butterworth and the Mad Baron.\n\nIt's just a massive well of content to draw from which I'm sure Netflix is foaming at the mouth to adapt, given how well the series has done and it's become one of their highest profile, most-watched offerings. So yes, it is very much conceivable we could be watching Bridgerton season 8 a decade from now, and perhaps even more past that. Hell, she could write more books in the next ten years too.\n\nFollow me on Twitter , Threads , YouTube , and Instagram .\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy ."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, the parent company of British retailer Boots, has seen its stock decline during a turbulent week after facing backlash over its allegedly \"woke\" Christmas advert.\n\nThe stock closed Friday at $8.48, down 3.75 percent from Thursday, continuing a broader downward trend. Walgreens-Boots shares are down 66 percent over the past year and trading at their lowest since 1996.\n\nLast week, Boots stirred conservative anger after releasing its Christmas commercial featuring actor Adjoa Andoh as Mrs. Claus and a scene referencing gender-inclusive pronouns, where Mrs. Claus uses they/them pronouns when referring to one gift recipient.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Walgreens-Boots Alliance via email for comment.\n\nAndoh was the subject of criticism in 2023, when she said King Charles III 's coronation ceremony was \"terribly white.\" She made the comments during British channel ITV's coverage of the coronation.\n\nBroadcast regulator Ofcom received over 8,000 complaints about the comment, but decided not to take action.\n\nFollowing Andoh's inclusion in the Boots ad, many online critics have accused the company of promoting \"woke\" values and promised to boycott the brand over Christmas.\n\nDarren Grimes, a presenter on conservative British television channel GB News, posted on X, formerly Twitter , \"Look at the share price of Boots since their Christmas ad came out with the 'terribly white' race baiting actress. People power.\" The post garnered 631,000 views by Sunday morning.\n\nAnother user @InevitableWest, a self-described \"Defender of Western values and culture,\" who has 61,800 followers on the site, also made a link between the advert and the stock price.\n\nIn a Friday X post, the user wrote, \"BREAKING: Walgreens Boots Alliance inc's (owner of Boots UK) has had $800 MILLION WIPED from their share capital following anti-white advert. Go woke, go BROKE. This is just the start.\" The post was viewed 2.6 million times by Sunday morning.\n\nWhile the drop coincides with the backlash, the stock has been declining in value for several years.\n\nIn October, Walgreens announced plans to shut down around 1,200 stores in the U.S. over the next three years in an attempt to overcome the $3-billion loss it recorded in its latest quarterly report.\n\nNo direct link between the ad and Walgreens-Boots stock performance has been confirmed.\n\nThe calls to abandon Boots this Christmas echo earlier conservative boycotts of American brands, where \"Go Woke, Go Broke,\" was a common rallying cry.\n\nThese have included the high-profile backlash against Bud Light in 2023 after the beer brand partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney . Bud Light's sales fell , and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev , saw a drop in stock value .\n\nConservative influencers have continued to apply this pressure to other companies, with recent boycotts targeting Dunkin' Donuts , Harley Davidson , and Tractor Supply for their apparent support of progressive causes.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nFlynn Nicholls is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. politics and society.

Despite this, ITV has so far refused to address the moment or the public outrage that has ensued.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Andoh, a Ghanaian-heritage actress who was born in Bristol, said: \"We have gone from the rich diversity of the Abbey to a terribly white balcony... I am very struck by that.\"\n\nThe actress, who is currently starring in Netflix's Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story , which controversially misrepresents Queen Charlotte as having black skin, went on to say: \"I am also looking at those younger generations and thinking: 'What are the nuances that they will inhabit when they grow?'\"\n\nAndolah wasn't the only British leftist to express rage over the British Royal family being British, with persistent staple of the legacy media, This Is Why I Resist author Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu claiming that the \"ideology of White Supremacy is literally, metaphorically & symbolically the bread & butter of British Monarchy & superbly exemplified on Buckingham Palace balcony while the multicultural/multiethnic/multi-race 'isms' stay below where they belong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Charlotte Proudman went on to complain about the supposed \"white male privilege\" displayed by the crowing of King Charles III. Her comments even drew a 'community notes' correction on Twitter, with users pointing out that for 134 of the last 200 years, a woman served as the head of state for the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile ITV has yet to make an apology over the comments broadcast on their airwaves, the Netflix actress - who is married to a white man - put out a quasi-apology, saying : \"I think I upset a few people yesterday.\n\n\"I was talking about the day and how marvellous it was and then looking at the balcony at the end and suddenly going: \"Oh it's so white!\" because the day had been so mixed and I didn't mean to upset anybody.\"\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

English Women's Soccer Team Criticised for Having Too Many 'Blonde and Blue-Eyed' Players\n\nThe English Women's World Cup team has been blasted for being too full of \"blonde, blue-eyed\" players, as the establishment media continues to air openly racial attacks on the native population of the country.\n\nFollowing a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Spain in Sunday's Women's World Cup, a panel discussion hosted by Sky News devolved into the topic of the supposed lack of diversity on the England squad rather than on the sport itself.\n\nDuring the segment, Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones MBE, a Jamaican-born British farmer, said in response to a Daily Mirror newspaper cover featuring the members of the 'Lionesses', saying: \"I don't want to pour boiling water on it but it isn't that diverse\"\n\n\"It really sticks out at you. They look blonde and blue-eyed. If it was the men's World Cup it would be very representative of the Britain that we're in and very, very diverse,\" he continued.\n\n\"What jumps out at you is that this doesn't represent diverse Britain. It's all these blonde blue-eyed girls - and I wish them well - but I do think we need to ask ourselves questions about why it is that there is a lack of diversity.\"\n\n\"If you could have the men's team which is very, very diverse, why doesn't that translate to the women's team?\"\n\nWhile the England team is mostly white, it is not the case that there is no diversity on the squad, with forward Lauren James and defender Jess Carter having diverse heritage.\n\nThe comments were reminiscent of those made by Brigerton actress Adjoa Andoh, who commented on national television during the coronation of King Charles, said that the Monarch and the Royal Family as a whole were \" terribly white \".\n\nThe comments also came as it was revealed that far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office had published a media guidance handbook that instructed staff that pictures of white families do not \" represent real Londoners \".\n\nEmmanuel-Jones' racially-tinged diatribe drew backlash on social media, with black political commentator Chris Rose writing : \"It's disappointing but predictable to see comments like this about the Women's England team.\n\n\"Could it not be possible that the best have been chosen? Other countries have football teams with similar levels of diversity but aren't criticised for it.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that England's Women's team has been criticised in the legacy media for being too white. Last year following a win over Norway in the UEFA European Women's Football Championship, BBC sports presenter Eilidh Barbour - a white woman herself - criticised the lack of diversity on the team.\n\nShe said : \"An historic eight-goal victory for England last night as the lionesses secured their place in the quarter-finals but all starting 11 players and the five substitutes that came on to the pitch were all white and that does point towards a lack of diversity in the women's game.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Like Clockwork: Leftists Use Coronation to Complain About Royal Family Being Too 'White'\n\nMillions of people in Britain and around the world tuned in to witness the ancient traditions performed at the Coronation of King Charles III, yet rather than celebrating the pageantry of the day, prominent leftists in the UK focussed on something else: that the Royal Family is apparently too \"white\".\n\nIn times past, the monarchy in Britain has served as a central point for which people of diverse political persuasions could come together around and bond as fellow countrymen. However, leftists in the UK have increasingly tried to tarnish the institution, which brought ideals of liberty and was central in stamping out slavery in the Western world, as nothing more than a racist relic of the nation's colonial past.\n\nSome on Saturday apparently could not hold back their vitriol for the Royal Family... or perhaps they couldn't resist using the large stage the Coronation provided to spread their leftist and anti-white rhetoric.\n\nFor example, appearing on ITV, Brigerton actress Adjoa Andoh commented on King Charles and his family waving to thousands of supporters from the balcony of Buckingham Palace: \"We have gone from the rich diversity of the Abbey to a terribly white balcony... I am very struck by that.\"\n\nAndoh, who was afforded the opportunity to become a successful actress on both sides of the Atlantic and who happens to be married to a white man, author Howard Cunnell, went on to say: \"I am also looking at those younger generations and thinking: 'What are the nuances that they will inhabit when they grow?'\"\n\nAndoh was far from, alone, with the likes of This Is Why I Resist author and frequent critic of the Royal Family - other than fellow woke leftist Meghan Markle - Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu said : \"The ideology of White Supremacy is literally, metaphorically & symbolically the bread & butter of British Monarchy & superbly exemplified on Buckingham Palace balcony while the multicultural/multiethnic/multi race 'isms' stay below where they belong.\"\n\nDr Shola, who is often propped up by legacy media outlets to criticise the colonial history of the UK, went on to describe supporters of the monarchy as having a \"peasant mentality\"\n\n\"A spectacle of STOLEN wealth. You BEG for crumbs while Charles reigns in TRADITION that put you in a chokehold,\" she wrote.\n\nIronically, even some white leftists got in on the act of criticising the King for his skin colour, with Dr Charlotte Proudman responding to a picture of Charles being crowned in Westminster Abbey: \"What a beautiful photograph of white male privilege and entitlement. Sums up who rules our country.\"\n\nReclaim Party leader and GB News host Laurence Fox responded : \"Perhaps you should quit your job and give it to one of those poor stupid black people who have little chance of succeeding without your white benevolence.\n\n\"Hey Siri. Define racism.\"\n\nDr Proudman, who serves as the Director of the woke campaign group Right2Equality, claimed that Fox's response somehow indicated that he - rather than her - thinks that black people are \"poor and stupid. Everything that's wrong with white male privilege is right here.\"\n\nFox shot back : \"I think that skin colour is incidental. You think it's crucial. Stop treating black people like they can only succeed with your benevolence. They are as smart and smarter in many cases than you are. Imagining yourself to be more privileged is the very definition of racism.\"\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Sexy Historical Romance Series 'Bridgerton' Is A Swoon-Worthy If Cliched Delight\n\nPrepare to swoon over Netflix's new Regency romance, filled to the brim with dashing rogues, charming innocents, gorgeous costumes, and scandals galore.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" follows a well-tread story, where the naive virgin and the brooding bad boy pretend to be in love in order to achieve their individual goals, only for genuine interest and affection to grow from the ruse. However, with likable characters, gorgeous production design, and a mysterious writer documenting the characters' every move in deliciously scandalous fashion, the clichéd plot lines become part of the fun.\n\nThe show has faced well-deserved comparisons to the teen drama \"Gossip Girl,\" as much of the show's drama arises from a mysterious gossip columnist going by Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews), whose regular pamphlet details the various romances, triumphs, falls, and missteps of the central characters. While it is a shame to have the incomparable Andrews in a series and resign her exclusively to a narrator with no on-screen presence, her proper yet snarky tone elevates the scandal-mongering to high art.\n\nProtagonists Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon Basset, duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page), are both born out of classic tropes, but the series explores what forged the pair into the archetypical respective ingenue and rake who begin the series. Daphne is an incredibly sheltered romantic, whose lack of experience in the world leads to both charming plot contrivances and serious drama.\n\nDynevor manages to avoid making Daphne either cloying or outright dumb, but a product of her environment and upbringing, for both better and worse. Simon is handsome and charismatic, with a predictably tragic backstory to render him mysterious, but Page imbues the character with a needed depth and complexity, entrancing the audience with the same allure that captures the interest of nearly every woman on the show.\n\nThe pair have electric chemistry, which can turn the most innocuous acts of removing a glove, walking together, grazing hands, or dancing into deeply sexually charged moments, fit to rival the very explicit love scenes. Much of the drama of their love story comes from illogically poor communication, but their misunderstandings are built into the characters' disparate world-views and experiences.\n\nThe whole ensemble of the supporting cast is excellent, inhabiting specific and engaging characters that create a rich, humorous tapestry of London society. Lady Danbury, played to perfection by Adjoa Andoh, is the show's voice of reason, and a major source of both humor and heart with well-timed one-liners and heartfelt advice.\n\nJonathan Bailey is especially notable as Anthony, the protective eldest child of the Bridgerton household. Anthony is a complicated man, torn between his duty towards his family, his love of a woman he could never marry, his friendship with Simon, and a sense of responsibility for his younger siblings. Anthony could have easily devolved into a joke, a villain, or a victim of circumstance, but Bailey finds a way to meld each reading into a far more well-rounded person.\n\nThe show does a spectacular job at balancing the romanticized aspects of balls and gallantry with the darker realities of the transactional nature of marriage in Regency England. Everyone is openly aware that women's futures depend solely on their abilities to find a wealthy husband from a good family.\n\nCharacters regularly refer to the marriage market as such, fully acknowledging all the phrase entails. Young women treat the process of finding a spouse like applying for a job; the girls' parents and suitors behave like commodity traders. It's refreshing to watch a period film to fully engage in the harsher side, rather than merely foisting a compromising marriage onto the protagonist's less-exciting friend.\n\nDaphne's desire to marry for love is treated as a charming dream, one that is only a remote possibility due to her beauty and social standing, and will clearly not be the case for every woman. Where most films and shows struggle to create meaningful stakes for their romantic storylines, \"Bridgerton's\" clarity of circumstance emphasizes the consequences.\n\nIn contrast to the presentation of courtship, the appearance of \"Bridgerton\" is charmingly idealized, with stunning costumes by Ellen Mirojnick and production design by Will Hughes-Jones. The clothes were all created for the series, with the team creating 7,500 original costumes that capture the era and the essence of the characters.\n\nDaphne's elegant blue and white gowns, Simon's distinctive vests and jackets, and the Fetheringtons' gaudy, colorful dresses stand out as especially notable, but each ball is filled with incredible original creations. The sets are likewise exquisite. Each ballroom, drawing room, and garden is filled with incredible detail, enriching the world while also looking beautiful.\n\nSome period films find era-appropriate music to score their scenes, while others use contemporary music to create atmosphere. \"Bridgerton\" split the difference, with much of the score consisting of instrumental covers of very recognizable pop music, including Ariana Grande's \"thank u next\" and Maroon 5's \"Girls Like You.\"\n\nThe arrangements are quite lovely, but remarkably distracting, existing between the past and present in an awkward manner that fails to transcend time, instead calling attention to the differences between the eras, especially when the sporadic Regency ballad or 21st-century pop song graces the soundtrack.\n\nThe show also relied a little too heavily on very explicit sex scenes. I have no problem with sex scenes when done well, but, like every other aspect of filmmaking, there should be a reason for their inclusion. Several of the love scenes had important narrative and character purpose, and even the graphicness was necessary for clarity. However, many others were frustratingly extended, to the point where banality begins to overshadow any shocked excitement or titillation.\n\nWhen one hour-long episode has more than 15 minutes spent in the bedroom (and garden, and staircase, and dining room, and anywhere else with a flat surface), it's gotten excessive. The show has only eight hours of content, with many engaging subplots and likable characters; it's interesting enough to not require leaning on sex to foster enjoyment.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" is far from a serious show, but it strikes just the right mix between luridly fun and engaging. Strong performances and character development balance out the soapy sex and romance nicely, creating a thoroughly bingeable and enjoyable series.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.
