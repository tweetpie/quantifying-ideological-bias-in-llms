      "text": "Cop who killed George Floyd 'stabbed by another inmate' in federal prison and 'seriously injured'\n\nDisgraced former Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin - who was convicted in 2021 for the murder of George Floyd - was just stabbed at a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Chauvin was \"stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured\" in the attack around 12:30 PM local time, and taken to a local hospital for further treatment after prison staff performed \"life-saving measures.\" Chauvin is roughly a year into both a 21-year federal prison sentence for depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights, and a 22 year state-level sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nChauvin was sent to FCI Tucson in 2022 after serving time at a maximum security prison in Minnesota, where he was largely kept in solitary confinement for his own protection. The AP reports that FCI Tucson has been \"plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages,\" and that this is the second such incident in roughly a year.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nIn November 2022, an inmate pulled a gun and attempted to shoot a visitor, though the weapon misfired and no one was hurt. This is also the second attack on a high-profile federal prisoner in the last five months. At a separate federal prison in Florida, former sports doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving time in prison for serial sex offenses committed against gymnasts, was stabbed by an inmate in July. He survived the attack.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Chauvin was recorded on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd for approximately eight minutes and 15 seconds, who was being detained for allegedly paying for a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Floyd was heard on the video screaming \"I can't breathe\" and crying for his mother in the moments before his murder. The video outraged protesters, who took to the streets both in the US and around the world in a summer-long wave of anti-police brutality protests, with \"I can't breathe\" as a rallying cry.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis of the events of that day, Chauvin \"did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\" Chauvin and several other officers present during Floyd's murder were all fired the next day, and subsequently charged by Hennepin County prosecutors. Tou Thao, who was acting as a \"human traffic cone\" at the time of Floyd's murder, was sentenced to four years and nine months in state prison."

Creighton vigorously attacks 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the ad, which the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler fact-checks in his September 16 column .\n\nIn the ad, Creighton says of Harris, \"Four years ago, in this alley, rioters threw a brick at my face and knocked out my teeth. Why? Because I was a police officer. And what did Kamala Harris do? While America's cities were burning, Kamala was defending peaceful protests. She raised millions to help bail rioters out of jail. And supported defunding our police, making us all less safe. Kamala Harris is dangerous.\"\n\nBut according to Kessler , Creighton \"ignores that Harris condemned the riots, even as she said people had a right to peacefully protest.\"\n\nCreighton, Kessler emphasizes , glosses over the fact that Harris was quite forceful in her condemnation of violent rioters in August 2020.\n\nFormer prosecutor Harris, then a U.S. senator, said, \"It's no wonder people are taking to the streets, and I support them. We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence.\"\n\nWhen riots took place in Portland, Oregon, Kessler notes , Harris tweeted, \"I join @JoeBiden in condemning this violence. This cannot - and must not - be who we are. Americans deserve a president who will heal our country and bring people together - not fan the flames of hate and division.\"\n\nCreighton's claim that Harris \"raised millions to help bail rioters out of jail,\" according to Kessler , \"cannot be verified.\"\n\nHarris, Kessler points out , supported a group called the Minneapolis Freedom Fund, which raised bail money for nonviolent Floyd protesters.\n\nGlenn Kessler's full Washington Post column is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "A paradoxical view of Black people emerged as a defense for the killing of George Floyd\n\nIn the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin , the defense mounted a perplexing account. Mr. Floyd, we were told, had an enlarged heart and inelastic lungs. Mr. Floyd was so weak that his death was all but inevitable. Had Mr. Floyd been healthier, he might have survived the relentless pressure of a knee upon his neck. But, then, the defense's narrative seemed to change: Derek Chauvin's use of lethal force was, in fact, necessitated by Mr. Floyd's purported superhuman strength.\n\nWas Mr. Floyd so physically weak he succumbed to an innocuous use of force? Or was he so strong that restraining him required extraordinary force? One defense witness offered a unifying explanation: perhaps Mr. Floyd's terrifying strength was caused by heart disease itself. Or, perhaps, a tumor triggered a fight-or-flight response that elevated his blood pressure. In this narrative, Mr. Floyd died because his underlying fragility triggered superhuman strength which, in turn, triggered fatal weakness.\n\nIt may be tempting to attribute this illogical argument to desperation on the part of the defense. This would be a mistake. Chauvin's defense was sadly rational. The prejudice it sought to exploit is pervasive and longstanding. In American society, Black people are viewed as both preternaturally strong as well as uniquely weak.\n\nWhite people must fear Black people and use extraordinary measures to protect themselves. Except, of course, when white violence or negligence triggers Black illness or death. Then, it is the fragility that precipitates the demise of Black bodies. Either way, one thing is clear: In American consciousness, Black people can rarely be victims. This notion-that Black people are at once too strong and too weak-has deep roots in American history, beginning in slavery and continuing in modern medical racism.\n\nDuring slavery, doctors postulated that Black people were especially susceptible to Tuberculosis and malaria. That this susceptibility was produced by the conditions of slavery was not seriously considered. Rather, vulnerability to disease was identified as a feature of Blackness. Enslaved Black people were also, according to doctors, uniquely resistant to pain, even as they suffered disproportionately of all manner of disease. Doctors used these false premises-inherent medical fragility paired with pain resistance-as justifications for the use of Black bodies in horrific medical experiments, ranging from intentional infection to gynecological mutilation to the boiling of flesh. The purported frailty and strength of Black bodies made Black human beings, in the eyes of many doctors, a perfect specimen for scientific exploration.\n\nEven today, health outcomes for Black Americans, by virtually every measure, and at every stage of life, are comparatively poor. Some of this disparity can be explained by socioeconomic and environmental factors. Black people are disproportionately struck by poverty . They are more likely to live in segregated neighborhoods afflicted by pollution and nutritional deprivation . They suffer from inadequate access to healthcare . These factors matter. But they do not tell the whole story. Disparities persist even when socioeconomic or environmental differences are controlled for.\n\nIndeed, researchers are finding that racism itself is an environmental variable that crosses socioeconomic barriers and induces life-long health complications. From diabetes to reproductive care , the evidence is converging. The chronic stress of anti-Black racism, independent of other variables, ravages Black American bodies. Little is spared. From brains to kidneys to bones, Black American bodies endure trauma, misdiagnosis and neglect. These patterns begin at birth and persist until death.\n\nFor example, Black babies are less likely than white babies to have early hearing loss identified and treated . Black children are less likely to receive tubes to treat otitis media , a crucial intervention that correlates with language development . In school, Black children are under-diagnosed with ADHD and over-diagnosed with conduct disorder, compared to their white peers, even when their symptomology is similar .\n\nAs Black Americans enter adulthood, health disparities become even more stark. Black men, for instance, are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and less likely to be diagnosed with depression than their white male peers. Diagnoses of dementia-critical for early intervention-are also chronically delayed for Black Americans.\n\nRacial disparities are especially stark in reproductive outcomes. Black women are more likely to experience miscarriages, preterm birth and stillbirth when compared to white women of the same socioeconomic status . Black women are less likely to get breast cancer, but they are 43 percent more likely to die after diagnosis. Black women are also more likely to undergo hysterectomy . In cases of heart disease, Black people are less likely to receive diagnostic angiography and preventative catheterization. 1\n\nBlack people are also often blamed for health outcomes, in both subtle and overt ways. The most obvious examples are in the right-wing media, as well as in specific cases such as the criminal defense of Derek Chauvin. However, we can also see examples throughout even ostensibly unbiased sources, such as the medical literature.\n\nType II diabetes has long been blamed on the \" African American Diet .\" Differential success of diabetes treatment has been attributed to poor \" medical literacy .\" Poor medical literacy is cited as a factor in the delayed diagnosis of Black infants' hearing impairment. Note the explanatory variable of \"medical literacy\" places responsibility on Black patients, not their doctors. This is in spite of research indicating that racial disparities in doctor-patient communication results from doctors' behavior , such as reduced listening, personal interaction and devotion of time to outpatient care.\n\nThe blaming of Black people has, in some cases, extended beyond \"poor medical literacy\" or \"bad diets\" to the nature of Black bodies themselves. One literature review went so far as to state \"variation in obesity and body-fat distribution\" may be a primary factor in the late diagnosis and poor prognosis of breast cancer in Black women. Similarly, doctors have explained that the systematic late diagnosis of Lyme disease in Black people is attributable to early signs of disease being difficult to detect on dark skin, to which one Black doctor responded : Is it actually that hard to identify on Black skin, or have doctors just been exclusively trained to treat white people?\n\nAnd then, finally, we must address Black pain. Multiple studies have shown that Black patients are under-diagnosed and under-treated for pain. Black patients are less likely to receive pain treatment for almost any diagnosis, even in the case of visible physical harm, such as a broken bone. Even Black children with appendicitis are less likely to be given pain treatment than white peers are. Research has shown white medical workers endorse racist stereotypes related to pain. One study demonstrated that an astonishing number of white medical workers endorsed a variety of racist myths , such that they believed Black patients' skin is thicker and their blood coagulates more quickly. These judgments most certainly correlate with treatment decisions.\n\nThe clearest example of racial disparities in medicine is in kidney disease. Here, we can see a trajectory beginning with negligence and ending with tragedy. We all learn that Black people suffer from disproportionate rates of kidney disease. We are told this is the fault of Black Americans. But we do not learn that Black people are:\n\nLet that sink in: This country does not only deny life-saving organs to Black Americans, but we also lop off their toes, feet and legs at disproportionate rates.\n\nThe treatment of Black bodies and minds in medicine reflects broader societal biases about Black pain. Physiological research indicates that white people exhibit decreased physiological responses to the emotional and physical pain of Black people. To put this plainly: if a white person witnesses a Black person experiencing pain, their neuronal responses remain close to baselines. They sweat less. Heart rates barely budge. And, although diminished responses to Black people in pain do correlate with overt racism, they also persist in white people who score very low on cognitive measures of racism.\n\nThis history-the rejection of Black pain and dehumanization of Black bodies-was the clear pretext for the criminal defense of Derek Chauvin. Mr. Floyd was to blame for his own death, because he was weak. However, his body could also be abused, because he was so strong. Chauvin's defense team was not unreasonable to attempt this, because they must have known, intuitively, as we all know, that a Black man's body is not viewed as the same as a white man's body. That a Black man's pleas for his mother or even oxygen will never be as worthy as a white man's same suffering.\n\nThese societal biases-and the cruelty they facilitate-were clear in our country's response to COVID-19. As the pandemic struck, it became apparent that Black people would be hit especially hard. And thus the frame shifted to a constant repetition of \"Well, the only people who suffer will be those with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nThe more we heard a right-wing refrain about diabetes, obesity, asthma and other ailments, the clearer it was: if you're Black and you die from COVID, it is your fault. We need not take extraordinary measures to protect you. The Trump administration itself admitted it was not compelled to relieve those who were not \" [their] people .\"\n\nHere, as in the murder of George Floyd, Black bodies were on trial. Black people were, again, to blame for their own suffering. In law enforcement, Black bodies induce white violence. In medicine, Black bodies deserve nothing more than white negligence.\n\nIn the case of Derek Chauvin, the defense placed George Floyd's body on trial. The jury rejected this argument in a verdict we should celebrate. But the problem is much bigger than this single case. Black bodies and minds are abused from birth until death. Before we can adopt policies that might fix the problem, we need to appreciate its scope and history. We must recognize our society characterizes Black people as too strong as well as too weak. Above all, we need to recognize our society's systematic abuse of Black bodies, and our almost pathological denial of Black victimization."

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi shrugs off criticism after her bizarre comment about George Floyd's death\n\nOn Tuesday, after a three-week trial, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who Chauvin pinned to ground on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill until Floyd died of \" asphyxiation from sustained pressure .\" Chauvin's conviction, a rare occurrence when it comes to the prosecution murder by police, drew a wide variety of responses from both the left and right, many of which received vicious backlash.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference following the verdict, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., delivered remarks with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"Thank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\" Pelosi declared. \"Because of you and because of thousands, millions of people around the world who came out for justice, your name will be synonymous with justice.\"\n\nPelosi's statement, far from her first gaffe, was widely panned as tone-deaf, but she appeared to just shrug it off.\n\n\"Pelosi thanking George Floyd for his 'sacrifice' continues the tradition of White people in power seeing us as Black pawns on their ivory chess boards,\" tweeted Albert Lee, a Black former Democratic Congressional candidate. \"George Floyd's life mattered before he was murdered.\" Pelosi later issued a follow-up statement clarifying her remarks.\n\nThe NFL's Las Vegas Raiders also caused quite a tizzy when they tweeted out: \"I CAN BREATHE 4-20-21.\" The tweet, reportedly inspired by what Floyd's brother Philonise told reporters following the verdict (\"Today, we are able to breathe again because justice for George means freedom for all.\"), received a sharp rebuke online. NBA player Lebron James retweeted the post: \"This is real???? Nah man this ain't it at all. The F^%K!!!!\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill De Blasio also expressed unsolicited thoughts over Twitter that drew widespread criticism. \"In June we watched in horror as Derek Chauvin took the life of George Floyd. The reality of racism in this nation finally hit a boiling point, the pain of more than 400 years of injustice. Today, justice was served.\" De Blasio, who defended the New York Police Department after its officers rammed into protestors with a car last summer, was raked through the coals by many on the left for whom the violent incident was still fresh in the mind.\n\nChauvin's conviction saw a lot of glib rhetoric from right-wing media as well. Ben Shapiro, conservative radio host and long time purveyor of the gish gallop, retweeted CNN anchor Don Lemon's tweet (\"Justice has been served\") and replied, \"We all know he would never have said this had the reverse verdict been reached.\"\n\nShapiro's retweet was widely mocked online and heavily ratioed by left-wing political commentator Hasan Abi, who rebutted: \"almost like there's a difference between a murderer going free and not.\"\n\nOther right-wing provocateurs gave their two cents. \"George Floyd is not and will never be a name that is synonymous with justice,\" tweeted Black conservative pundit Candace Owens. \"He victimized TOO MANY people during his life.\" Tomi Lahren, known for her particular animus toward Black-led demonstrations of any kind, raged, \"You got your justice so I'd assume there will be peace in Minneapolis tonight? No rioting? No looting? No harassing officers?\"\n\n\"Is the Foot Locker safe tonight?\" Lahren continued . \"Should be, right? Justice, right?

      "text": "Defense expert claims George Floyd should have been 'resting comfortably' with knee on his neck\n\nThe defense in the murder trial of ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin began building its case this week, and unfortunately but predictably attorneys seem to be trying to convince the jury that George Floyd was responsible for his own death. Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert called by the defense on Tuesday, aided the defense in some regards. He testified that sometimes suspects \"don't feel pain\" and have \"superhuman strength\" while on drugs. He also said that Floyd was \"actively resisting\" and \"struggling against the officers\" for several minutes when being held in the prone position. \"A compliant person would have both their hands in the small of their back and just be resting comfortably versus like he's still moving around,\" Brodd said when shown a photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck.\n\nHe even claimed that holding Floyd in the prone position while he was handcuffed didn't constitute a use of force because Floyd wasn't in pain. \"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified, and was acting with objective reasonableness, following Minneapolis Police Department policy and current standards of law enforcement, in his interactions with Mr. Floyd,\" Brodd said. But even the alleged expert couldn't stick with that interpretation of the facts when the prosecution presented him with body-camera video and photos. He ended up admitting that the position Floyd was held in could inflict pain and that Chauvin's response did not align with the Minneapolis Police Department's policy.\n\nIn other matters pertaining to the case, however, Brodd seemed to stick with his interpretation of what happened. What the prosecution called \"writhing on the ground because he can't breathe,\" Brodd deemed to be resisting. When Floyd said \"everything hurts,\" Brodd admitted he didn't \"note it.\"\n\nWhen Floyd said his neck hurt, Brodd also admitted that he didn't make a note of it. Why, it's almost as if he was preparing for this very moment to be of use to the defense. In fact, his testimony contradicts nearly every police official who's testified in this case during the first two weeks, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo.\n\n\"There's an initial reasonableness in trying to just get him under control in the first few seconds,\" Arradondo testified last Monday, \"but once there was no longer any resistance and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive, and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone out, handcuffed behind their back, that, that in no way, shape, or form is anything that is by policy.\n\n\"It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or our values.\"\n\nThe defense continued building on its position that Floyd's drug use caused his death, with attorney Eric Nelson focusing on the testimony of a woman who is a retired paramedic and knew Floyd. Former emergency worker Michelle Moseng testified that Floyd told during an earlier arrest in 2019 that he had taken a opioid, but he was not in respiratory distress as a result at that time.\n\nShawanda Hill, who was in the SUV Floyd was sitting in at the time of his detainment, testified that Floyd was \"happy, normal, talking, alert\" before his death on May 25, 2020. She said she had bumped into him at the Cup Foods store and he offered to give her a ride home; but while she was taking a call from her daughter, Floyd fell asleep. Hill said he nodded off repeatedly, but Floyd didn't wake up until Hill told him police were outside his window. At one point, an officer had a gun pointed at the window, she said.\n\n\"So he instantly grabbed the wheel and he was like, 'please please don't kill me. Please please don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. What did I do? Just tell me what I did,'\" Hill recounted.\n\nTestimony from Minneapolis police officer Peter Chang seemed to support another element of Chauvin's defense, that a loud and unruly crowd of onlookers posed an added risk and distraction to officers. Chang described the crowd as \"aggressive,\" but earlier witnesses testified that they were only frustrated and desperately trying to get Floyd help.\n\nGenevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter who lived in the area of Cup Foods, testified that she tried to help but former Minneapolis Police Officer Tou Thao prevented her from intervening and even questioned her authority. \"'If you really are a Minnesota firefighter you would know better than to get involved,'\" Hansen said of Thao's reported words. She broke down in tears when describing how frustrated she felt knowing that she could help but not even being allowed to try. She admitted to calling officers a \"b---h.\" \"Mm hmm, yeah, I got quite angry after Mr. Floyd was loaded into the ambulance and there was no point in trying to reason with them anymore because they had just killed somebody,\" Hansen said.\n\nView other social media postings related to the trial:"

      "text": "Presidential historian lays out the reasons why George Floyd's death sealed Trump's fate as a one-term president\n\nHistorian Jon Meacham is great at explaining how modern events fit into the big picture and how events of the past offer insights on the present, and he did exactly that when - during an April 16 appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" - he weighed in on Derek Chauvin's trial and far-right evangelical Pat Robertson's response to it.\n\nChauvin is the Minneapolis police officer who has faced murder charges because of his role in the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. The defense rested its case in Chauvin's trial on April 15, and Robertson - the long-time host of \"The 700 Club\" and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network - shocked viewers by being highly critical of Chauvin and citing him as a glaring example of someone who never should have been in police work. Robertson is a very divisive figure who is disliked by many liberals and progressives as well as right-wing libertarians, but his comments on Chauvin have been applauded by some of his most vehement critics.\n\nMeacham, an Episcopalian, said of the 91-year-old Robertson, \"If somebody does something right, you welcome him - and you welcome it.\" And Meacham stressed that the videos of Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck were shocking even to Robertson.\n\nNoting Robertson's influence on the Republican Party, Meacham explained, \"Robertson was kind of the official embodiment of the rise of the Religious Right. I think it began with the school prayer decision in 1962. It was slow in developing. A lot of White evangelicals stayed out of politics in the mid-1960s because they were uncomfortable with civil rights, which was a space that was clearly associated with the Black church.\"\n\nPat Robertson Slams Policing In America | Morning Joe | MSNBC www.youtube.com\n\nThe historian told \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that Floyd's death intensified a \"conversation\" that Americans have been having for generations - a \"conversation on race\" - and served as a painful reminder that \"systemic racism exists\" in the United States and \"police reforming is necessary.\" And Meacham also argued that Floyd's death led to the end of Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nA week after Floyd's death, on June 1, 2020, nonviolent protesters in Washington, D.C.'s Lafayette Square were demanding justice for him when they were violently removed by police so that Trump and his allies could walk from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church - where Trump gave a speech and had his much maligned \"Bible photo-op.\"\n\nThat day, Meacham argued, sealed Trump's fate in the 2020 presidential election and convinced millions of Americans and \"a lot of White people\" to vote against Trump and reject \"a culture of White supremacy.\"\n\n\"The death of George Floyd, in many ways - if you look back on the year of 2020 - in a lot of ways, Lafayette Square, the events that unfolded in that terrible period really brought home to people.... that the Trump era had come to manifest many, many of our worst impulses,\" Meacham told Scarborough and Brzezinski. \"I have a theory that in the national mind, to some extent, Joe Biden kind of became president-elect during Lafayette Square.\"\n\nMorning Joe 4/16/2021 6AM | MSNBC Breaking News Today April 16, 2021 www.youtube.com"

      "text": "The America That Killed George Floyd\n\nIn a new biography of the man whose murder sparked massive protests, two reporters tell a longer story of institutional racism.\n\nI n the late '90s, not long after I left Cameroon to attend college in the United States, I learned of a word used in certain African-immigrant communities to refer to African Americans: Akata . It was not uttered with affection; far from it- Akata means \"wild animal,\" and thus has much in common with the N-word. In my early days here, it wasn't unusual for me to see a fellow African look at an African American and say, with a sneer, \"Look at that Akata ,\" or \"I just don't understand these Akatas .\"\n\nDays after George Floyd was killed, I attended a Zoom memorial of sorts, organized by Africans for Africans, so we could mourn his death together and think of how we, as a community, could better treat our American brethren. The ludicrousness of this was not lost on me-that it would take so long, take a tragedy of this public magnitude, for us to see what America had been doing to our brothers and sisters; that it would take a graphic video for both immigrants and citizens of America to comprehend what they'd wrought in fostering an environment in which African Americans are so often treated like animals.\n\nEarly on in His Name Is George Floyd , Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa make mention of the fact that George Floyd wanted to change the world. \"As long as anyone can remember,\" they write, he \"wanted the world to know his name.\" It is hard to read this sentence and not feel a twinge of sadness, considering that the world did not come to know his name in the way he'd imagined. It's unlikely that Floyd ever dreamed he would one day cause an entire nation-nay, the entire planet-to reckon with its centuries-long destruction of Black bodies.\n\nAs Samuels and Olorunnipa tell it, Floyd's aspirations were quite ordinary-he wanted, among other things, to be an athlete and achieve fame and fortune, but American racism stood in his way, and Floyd stood in his own way, largely as a reaction to American racism standing in his way. This mélange created an unsustainable situation that was all but bound to explode.\n\nRead: Why Minneapolis was the breaking point\n\nSamuels and Olorunnipa deserve every praise for presenting Floyd as the complex character that he was-what human isn't? Both writers are Black men and could easily have diluted portions of the book that show Floyd's many shortcomings and poor decision making, but they resisted the urge. The result is an expertly researched and excellent biography, a necessary and enlightening read for all, especially those who, like my fellow African immigrants in the '90s, have ever looked upon young Black men in the inner city with disdain.\n\nI f America were a more perfect union, George Floyd might have been born into a wealthy family thanks to his industrious great-great-grandfather, a former enslaved person who \"after more than thirty years of working as a free man ... had managed to amass five hundred acres of his own farmland\" in a period when, at one point, \"less than 2 percent of White farmers in North Carolina held more than five hundred acres of land.\"\n\nBut America then, and now, is not a place where white people are overly comfortable with Black success, so white men had Floyd's ancestor dealt with, eventually dispossessing him of all those acres and ensuring that later generations would not get a sniff at the American dream. And so it would be. By the time George Floyd was born in October 1973, every generation since his ancestral land was stolen had known only failed dreams. He spent his early days living with his family in a trailer park in North Carolina as his parents nursed the pains of their futile attempts to escape poverty. Their marriage ended when Floyd was still a boy, and his mother moved, along with her children, to Houston, where they ultimately settled in a housing project \"with a population that was 99 percent Black and most residents living well below the poverty line.\"\n\nStill, his was a fairly happy childhood, surrounded by a loving mother, siblings, relatives who regaled him with stories of his ancestors, and a community where everyone felt as if they were part of one big Black family. Such sections of the book, which depict how much Floyd was loved and how much he loved back, are a joy to read, a celebration of one of the many beauties of African American culture-a people's ability to get together and eat and laugh and have an overall good time, as if they weren't one of the most persecuted people in human history.\n\nIn addition to his community, Floyd was blessed with a teacher-a white teacher, as it happens-who \"put together a curriculum designed to engender a sense of Black pride and potential\" in Floyd and her other students. It was in part thanks to her that Floyd was a solid student in elementary school and proceeded to become a star athlete in high school. His high-school football team's attempt to win the state championship is a thriller in its own right, but its achievement did little to help Floyd become a pro. When his athletic ambition failed, his descent began.\n\nRead: The enormous scale of this movement\n\nThis much is clear: George Floyd was a devoted son, a loyal friend, a caring sibling, an esteemed member of his community. He was also a drug user and trader, not the hardest worker, someone convicted of aggravated robbery-you'd have to read the story of the robbery to decide for yourself whether he was truly guilty-and far from a great boyfriend, though he never seemed to run out of women eager to fall in love with him and go to great lengths to make him a better man. Did he want to become a better man? Yes, he did, and he made several attempts at it. After cycling in and out of prison, falling in and out of drug addiction, he picked up and, with the help of a friend determined to see Black men turn their lives around, moved to Minneapolis in search of redemption and a chance to atone for his mistakes. He yearned to create a life he would be proud of, especially because, by then, he had a child, a daughter named Gianna, whom he dearly loved.\n\nA nyone who was old enough in 2020 knows what became of him in Minneapolis.\n\nBut Samuels and Olorunnipa are not interested merely in replaying that horror story. Theirs is a far more ambitious mission, to demonstrate all the ways in which American laws and government policies (intentionally racist or otherwise) conspired against George Floyd. And there is no shortage of examples.\n\nRichard Nixon declared a War on Drugs in the '70s, treating drug abuse as a crime rather than as a public-health concern, something that an aide to Nixon later admitted, as Samuels and Olorunnipa paraphrase it, was an effort to \"target, vilify, and disrupt Black communities-seen at the time as a political threat to the president.\" It worked. Ronald Reagan cut the social safety nets that had benefited poor families like the Floyds, sending them into deeper poverty. The state of Texas in 1990 started requiring all high-school students to pass an assessment test as a requirement for graduation, despite being aware that a majority of its Black students, Floyd included, were unprepared and would fail. And if one is inclined to think that anti-Black measures were largely pushed by conservatives, the Democrats did their fair share of showing that they too could be tough on crime (read: Black people) when Bill Clinton signed a crime bill sponsored by then-Senator Joe Biden.\n\nIs it therefore a surprise that when the sun rose on the day of his death, George Floyd was a poorly educated Black man with a history of drug abuse, multiple health problems, and a list of criminal convictions and stints in prison, flailing through the early days of a pandemic that was disproportionately affecting Black folks? Samuels and Olorunnipa don't need to answer that question; it is clear from their work that America had been slowly killing George Floyd for decades before Derek Chauvin pressed the last breath out of him.\n\nWhich is why it is confounding that the authors shy away from more pointedly calling out the hypocrisy of governments and corporations and all manners of institutions that immediately took the knee, vigorously condemned Chauvin, and pledged their allegiance to anti-racism, not because it was just but because it suited them. The authors know this, and yet a good portion of this book is spent on the Chauvin trial and the theatrics of the aftermath of the killing, as if all the superficial changes in the world will prevent future tragedies of this nature.\n\nPerhaps I am transferring my disappointment with America onto Samuels and Olorunnipa. Perhaps I am unfairly asking them to do more than bear witness. I imagine they would say, in their defense, that putting America on trial for the death of George Floyd is an impossibility, and beyond the scope of this book. Fair enough, but deep down I know, many of us know, that even with Chauvin in prison, justice has not been fully served. Those entities that created the conditions for Floyd's death carry on. They thrive. Their next victim awaits.\n\nRead: George Floyd was also a father\n\nThis, perhaps, was why at the end of reading this book, I felt nothing but a deep exasperation. An exasperation not unlike what I experienced after reading Nathan McCall's Makes Me Wanna Holler , and Jeff Hobbs's The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace , similarly outstanding books that chronicle the plight of modern-day African American men.\n\nSuch accounts are even more imperative these days, because, despite all the Black Lives Matter bumper stickers on our cars and signs stuck into our yards, despite all our self-professed \"wokeness,\" these authors know that millions of George Floyds still live among us and we as a nation do not care enough whether they live or die.\n\nBut what good is cynicism? George Floyd, as presented by Samuels and Olorunnipa, was a man of tremendous hope. Notwithstanding the many millstones this country threw around his neck, he continued to believe that he would overcome. It was always absurd to imagine that Floyd's killing would somehow lead to the end of systemic racism-certainly Kamala Harris's assertion, as Samuels and Olorunnipa characterize it, that Floyd's death  \"could allow the country to sing a new song when it came to racial justice\" seems laughably naive just two years later. But the portrait that remains is of a man who encouraged others to never give up, a man who would have urged us to never stop fighting for a more just America and to never stop believing that there shall surely come a day when stories like his will no longer need to be told.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "George Floyd Was Also a Father\n\nFor many of us, when we see the Floyds, we see our family.\n\nAn image of George Floyd and his daughter Gianna has been circulating around social media since yesterday. George is sitting in the driver's seat of a car, wearing a black T-shirt and black baseball cap with the word Houston emblazoned in cursive letters above the brim.\n\nIn the passenger seat is Gianna, who is now 7 years old, but in the photo-taken a few years ago-looks as if she isn't more than 3 or 4. She is wearing a purple-and-pink shirt and matching pants and a small plastic bracelet on her right wrist, and has several silver and pink bobbles tied into her hair. Her right hand is holding a pair of plastic blue-and-black sunglasses-the sort made for children with the expectation that they will not last very long-and she looks as if she has pulled the large glasses down from her face and to her chin specifically for the picture.\n\nI find the photo compelling for a couple of reasons. George and his daughter share a striking resemblance. The image has captured them in a moment of uncanny synchrony-bodies facing forward, heads turned toward the camera to their left, each of their mouths slightly ajar. The photo also draws you in to both pairs of eyes. Eyes that are still, direct, calm, and so clearly built from the same blocks of DNA.\n\nThe photo is striking, too, because Gianna here reminds me so much of my own daughter. My daughter is 2 years old and has worn those same sorts of sunglasses around our house. I'm pretty sure that we have several scattered under couches, behind teddy bears, and at the bottom of our toy chest. They are the kind of toddler accessory that begs you to take a photo because the sunglasses are half the size of the child's small face. My daughter wears her hair the same way, with ties that have colorful balls so that when she runs toward the slide at the park, they rattle against one another and create a chorus of tiny cackles. My sister wore her hair the same way as a child, the way my cousins did, the way my nieces do, the way little Black girls we meet at the park also do. \"My hair!\" my daughter will say, pointing toward another child with the same style, and then touching the top of her head as if to make sure that someone had not in fact taken her hair and put it on someone else's head.\n\nThis similarity and connection, along with many others, have made many Black people feel a level of intimate proximity to the Floyd family and deeply distressed by what happened to George. Saying you can see yourself in another person can sometimes sound trite. But for many of us, when we see the Floyds, we see our family.\n\nClint Smith: Becoming a parent in the age of Black Lives Matter\n\nI watched the Floyd family's press conference yesterday, after the verdict was announced. Members of his family came up to the podium to share their thoughts, appreciation, and reflections, and I heard many of the voices and saw many of the dynamics that exist in my own family. Alongside the sense of relief was the banter, the playfulness, the lilt in their voices.\n\nEven if we are of a different socioeconomic status, we see those same bobbles in Gianna's hair that we put into the hair of our own children. Even if we have never experienced addiction as George did, chances are we are close to a friend or family member who did. In this photo, you see a small Black child and her Black father sitting together in a car on a day that probably felt like any other day. Perhaps they were preparing for a trip to the playground and thinking of getting a Happy Meal from McDonald's, or perhaps she simply hopped in the front seat of the car to say hello to her daddy and show him her new sunglasses.\n\nYesterday, I watched the judge read the verdict of the trial alongside my wife in our home. I could feel my heart thumping against my chest; I could see her legs shaking as she leaned toward the TV, hands covering her mouth. The judge read the jury's verdict :\n\nWe, the jury, in the above entitled matter as to count one, unintentional second-degree murder while committing a felony, find the defendant guilty.\n\n...We, the jury, in the above entitled matter as to count two, third-degree murder perpetrating an eminently dangerous act, find the defendant guilty.\n\n...We, the jury, in the above entitled matter as to count three, second-degree manslaughter, culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk, find the defendant guilty.\n\nEach of us took a deep breath, a wave of something like relief moving through us. As we found our way back into our bodies, both of our children sauntered over. My almost-4-year-old son was carrying a plastic dinosaur and had a mouth painted in patches of purple from his peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and my daughter was bobbing her head back and forth as if music were playing all around that only she could hear. I picked up my son, and my daughter crawled into my wife's lap on the couch. I kissed my son on the cheek and looked at my daughter and made a funny face. She laughed and said, \"Daddy silly.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Chauvin's conviction is the exception that proves the rule\n\nThese small moments with our children make parenthood what it is. George and his daughter no longer have these moments. To say that I feel \"good\" about the verdict wouldn't be right. I feel hope that Floyd's family will be able to find some peace. I hope that Gianna's memories of her father, to the extent possible, are shaped not only by the symbol he has become to the world, but by those small moments of laughter and joy the two of them shared. George has become a symbol, but he was also a father. And in so many ways, the latter is far more important."

      "text": "The America That Killed George Floyd\n\nIn a new biography of the man whose murder sparked massive protests, two reporters tell a longer story of institutional racism.\n\nI n the late '90s, not long after I left Cameroon to attend college in the United States, I learned of a word used in certain African-immigrant communities to refer to African Americans: Akata . It was not uttered with affection; far from it- Akata means \"wild animal,\" and thus has much in common with the N-word. In my early days here, it wasn't unusual for me to see a fellow African look at an African American and say, with a sneer, \"Look at that Akata ,\" or \"I just don't understand these Akatas .\"\n\nDays after George Floyd was killed, I attended a Zoom memorial of sorts, organized by Africans for Africans, so we could mourn his death together and think of how we, as a community, could better treat our American brethren. The ludicrousness of this was not lost on me-that it would take so long, take a tragedy of this public magnitude, for us to see what America had been doing to our brothers and sisters; that it would take a graphic video for both immigrants and citizens of America to comprehend what they'd wrought in fostering an environment in which African Americans are so often treated like animals.\n\nEarly on in His Name Is George Floyd , Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa make mention of the fact that George Floyd wanted to change the world. \"As long as anyone can remember,\" they write, he \"wanted the world to know his name.\" It is hard to read this sentence and not feel a twinge of sadness, considering that the world did not come to know his name in the way he'd imagined. It's unlikely that Floyd ever dreamed he would one day cause an entire nation-nay, the entire planet-to reckon with its centuries-long destruction of Black bodies.\n\nAs Samuels and Olorunnipa tell it, Floyd's aspirations were quite ordinary-he wanted, among other things, to be an athlete and achieve fame and fortune, but American racism stood in his way, and Floyd stood in his own way, largely as a reaction to American racism standing in his way. This mélange created an unsustainable situation that was all but bound to explode.\n\nRead: Why Minneapolis was the breaking point\n\nSamuels and Olorunnipa deserve every praise for presenting Floyd as the complex character that he was-what human isn't? Both writers are Black men and could easily have diluted portions of the book that show Floyd's many shortcomings and poor decision making, but they resisted the urge. The result is an expertly researched and excellent biography, a necessary and enlightening read for all, especially those who, like my fellow African immigrants in the '90s, have ever looked upon young Black men in the inner city with disdain.\n\nI f America were a more perfect union, George Floyd might have been born into a wealthy family thanks to his industrious great-great-grandfather, a former enslaved person who \"after more than thirty years of working as a free man ... had managed to amass five hundred acres of his own farmland\" in a period when, at one point, \"less than 2 percent of White farmers in North Carolina held more than five hundred acres of land.\"\n\nBut America then, and now, is not a place where white people are overly comfortable with Black success, so white men had Floyd's ancestor dealt with, eventually dispossessing him of all those acres and ensuring that later generations would not get a sniff at the American dream. And so it would be. By the time George Floyd was born in October 1973, every generation since his ancestral land was stolen had known only failed dreams. He spent his early days living with his family in a trailer park in North Carolina as his parents nursed the pains of their futile attempts to escape poverty. Their marriage ended when Floyd was still a boy, and his mother moved, along with her children, to Houston, where they ultimately settled in a housing project \"with a population that was 99 percent Black and most residents living well below the poverty line.\"\n\nStill, his was a fairly happy childhood, surrounded by a loving mother, siblings, relatives who regaled him with stories of his ancestors, and a community where everyone felt as if they were part of one big Black family. Such sections of the book, which depict how much Floyd was loved and how much he loved back, are a joy to read, a celebration of one of the many beauties of African American culture-a people's ability to get together and eat and laugh and have an overall good time, as if they weren't one of the most persecuted people in human history.\n\nIn addition to his community, Floyd was blessed with a teacher-a white teacher, as it happens-who \"put together a curriculum designed to engender a sense of Black pride and potential\" in Floyd and her other students. It was in part thanks to her that Floyd was a solid student in elementary school and proceeded to become a star athlete in high school. His high-school football team's attempt to win the state championship is a thriller in its own right, but its achievement did little to help Floyd become a pro. When his athletic ambition failed, his descent began.\n\nRead: The enormous scale of this movement\n\nThis much is clear: George Floyd was a devoted son, a loyal friend, a caring sibling, an esteemed member of his community. He was also a drug user and trader, not the hardest worker, someone convicted of aggravated robbery-you'd have to read the story of the robbery to decide for yourself whether he was truly guilty-and far from a great boyfriend, though he never seemed to run out of women eager to fall in love with him and go to great lengths to make him a better man. Did he want to become a better man? Yes, he did, and he made several attempts at it. After cycling in and out of prison, falling in and out of drug addiction, he picked up and, with the help of a friend determined to see Black men turn their lives around, moved to Minneapolis in search of redemption and a chance to atone for his mistakes. He yearned to create a life he would be proud of, especially because, by then, he had a child, a daughter named Gianna, whom he dearly loved.\n\nA nyone who was old enough in 2020 knows what became of him in Minneapolis.\n\nBut Samuels and Olorunnipa are not interested merely in replaying that horror story. Theirs is a far more ambitious mission, to demonstrate all the ways in which American laws and government policies (intentionally racist or otherwise) conspired against George Floyd. And there is no shortage of examples.\n\nRichard Nixon declared a War on Drugs in the '70s, treating drug abuse as a crime rather than as a public-health concern, something that an aide to Nixon later admitted, as Samuels and Olorunnipa paraphrase it, was an effort to \"target, vilify, and disrupt Black communities-seen at the time as a political threat to the president.\" It worked. Ronald Reagan cut the social safety nets that had benefited poor families like the Floyds, sending them into deeper poverty. The state of Texas in 1990 started requiring all high-school students to pass an assessment test as a requirement for graduation, despite being aware that a majority of its Black students, Floyd included, were unprepared and would fail. And if one is inclined to think that anti-Black measures were largely pushed by conservatives, the Democrats did their fair share of showing that they too could be tough on crime (read: Black people) when Bill Clinton signed a crime bill sponsored by then-Senator Joe Biden.\n\nIs it therefore a surprise that when the sun rose on the day of his death, George Floyd was a poorly educated Black man with a history of drug abuse, multiple health problems, and a list of criminal convictions and stints in prison, flailing through the early days of a pandemic that was disproportionately affecting Black folks? Samuels and Olorunnipa don't need to answer that question; it is clear from their work that America had been slowly killing George Floyd for decades before Derek Chauvin pressed the last breath out of him.\n\nWhich is why it is confounding that the authors shy away from more pointedly calling out the hypocrisy of governments and corporations and all manners of institutions that immediately took the knee, vigorously condemned Chauvin, and pledged their allegiance to anti-racism, not because it was just but because it suited them. The authors know this, and yet a good portion of this book is spent on the Chauvin trial and the theatrics of the aftermath of the killing, as if all the superficial changes in the world will prevent future tragedies of this nature.\n\nPerhaps I am transferring my disappointment with America onto Samuels and Olorunnipa. Perhaps I am unfairly asking them to do more than bear witness. I imagine they would say, in their defense, that putting America on trial for the death of George Floyd is an impossibility, and beyond the scope of this book. Fair enough, but deep down I know, many of us know, that even with Chauvin in prison, justice has not been fully served. Those entities that created the conditions for Floyd's death carry on. They thrive. Their next victim awaits.\n\nRead: George Floyd was also a father\n\nThis, perhaps, was why at the end of reading this book, I felt nothing but a deep exasperation. An exasperation not unlike what I experienced after reading Nathan McCall's Makes Me Wanna Holler , and Jeff Hobbs's The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace , similarly outstanding books that chronicle the plight of modern-day African American men.\n\nSuch accounts are even more imperative these days, because, despite all the Black Lives Matter bumper stickers on our cars and signs stuck into our yards, despite all our self-professed \"wokeness,\" these authors know that millions of George Floyds still live among us and we as a nation do not care enough whether they live or die.\n\nBut what good is cynicism? George Floyd, as presented by Samuels and Olorunnipa, was a man of tremendous hope. Notwithstanding the many millstones this country threw around his neck, he continued to believe that he would overcome. It was always absurd to imagine that Floyd's killing would somehow lead to the end of systemic racism-certainly Kamala Harris's assertion, as Samuels and Olorunnipa characterize it, that Floyd's death  \"could allow the country to sing a new song when it came to racial justice\" seems laughably naive just two years later. But the portrait that remains is of a man who encouraged others to never give up, a man who would have urged us to never stop fighting for a more just America and to never stop believing that there shall surely come a day when stories like his will no longer need to be told.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Subscribe to get this delivered to your inbox .\n\nThe killing of a black man at the hands of the police in Minneapolis has stirred outrage. Earlier this month, my colleague Adam Serwer outlined the bitter terms of America's racial contract , \"a codicil rendered in invisible ink, one stating that the rules as written do not apply to nonwhite people in the same way.\" We asked him about George Floyd:\n\nI wrote a few weeks ago that \"video evidence of unjustified shootings of black people is so jarring in part because it exposes the terms of the racial contract so vividly.\" George Floyd was not shot, but he was killed on video by Minneapolis police while both Floyd and bystanders pleaded for help. The officers arresting him did nothing to save him. That indifference to Floyd's life is a clause in the racial contract, in that the officers themselves did not see Floyd's life as one they were bound to serve and protect, and did not expect to be punished for failing to do so.\n\nAdam's piece is worth revisiting-do so here.\n\nSummer 2020 is shaping up to be a season of risk assessment.\n\nIn the spring, the directive was clear: Stay home, to allow doctors and scientists the time to play catch-up.\n\nGoing forward, the calculus is more complicated. While staying home is still the safest option, we'll need to build structures that allow for relief from quarantine fatigue .\n\n\"Thinking about safety as binary isn't going to cut it anymore,\" Amanda Mull explains. \"The key to responsibly reopening your life is understanding what makes you and those around you more or less safe at any given moment.\"\n\nThankfully, researchers now know more about this virus than they did in the chilly days of early spring. Their findings are preliminary, but they can help Americans better understand the risks. Below, our reporters offer a preview of the forthcoming strange summer:\n\nOutdoor areas are believed to carry lower risk for transmission.\n\n\"Globally, documented cases of outdoor transmission are exceedingly rare so far; the one most frequently cited involved two friends who had a lengthy, close interaction,\" Amanda reports.\n\nBut pool parties are still likely a no-go.\n\n\"The coronavirus can't remain infectious in pool water, multiple experts assured me,\" Olga Khazan writes, \"but people who come to pools do not stay in the water the entire time.\"\n\nThe great indoors will need some major retooling.\n\n\"Offices, schools, stores, theaters, restaurants, bars, gyms, fitness centers, and museums will have no semblance of normalcy until we learn how to be safe-and feel safe-inside,\" Derek Thompson writes.\n\nFor now, avoid indoor spaces where large groups of people spend extended periods of time close together.\n\nThese kinds of places could seed super-spreading events, Amanda explains. \"If you live in a state that now allows people to go out to bars, return to work in open-plan offices, or attend religious services, even in reduced numbers, the best and simplest thing you can do to protect your health is to avoid those situations like, well, the plague.\"\n\nOne question, answered: What happens if a major natural disaster strikes during the pandemic?\n\nTornadoes have already hit some parts of the country, and hurricane season is approaching. The combination of natural disasters and a pandemic could prove catastrophic: There's the added challenge of how to safely evacuate and shelter people without furthering the spread of COVID-19. The economic repercussions of the pandemic will make it harder for people to prepare and recover. And the country's already-strained medical and emergency-management systems would bear even bigger burdens.\n\nEmergency managers are updating disaster plans and doing trial runs to figure out how to adapt to our new reality. But experts agree that now is a time for everyone-individual citizens, too- to take preparedness seriously . Some ways to do that: Make an evacuation plan and keep a hard copy of it; read your state's disaster survival guides; stock up on a few weeks' worth of supplies if you can.\n\nWhat to read if ... you just want practical advice:\n\nA guide to staying safe as states reopen\n\n30 movies that are unlike anything you've seen before\n\n20 books to read in quarantine this summer\n\nView all of our stories related to the coronavirus outbreak here.

      "text": "How Do You Kneel on a Neck for Nine Minutes?\n\nI don't see how anyone could remain in that position unless he was, at best, totally indifferent to the person's survival.\n\nThe most unsettling reporting I have done on the subject of human necks was in March 2014 in the Central African Republic. I was interviewing a militiaman who said he had killed Muslims, and offered to demonstrate. He then took out a blade and posed with his friend, placing the cutting edge against the man's throat. What gave me the creeps was not the knife hand but the other one. His fingers pulled taut the skin of his friend's neck, the better to ensure a firm cutting surface for the blade. The move was instinctive-and to me familiar, from having butchered animals. If you don't pull the flesh tight, your knife doesn't bite cleanly, and you make a mess of things. I saw that finger and thought: This man really has done this before.\n\nA close relative of that thought is what many Americans have experienced in the past few days, contemplating what diseased mind could place a knee on the neck of another human being and press until the man died. The tactile experience of kneeling into a human neck is not familiar to most people, and the video of Derek Chauvin, then a Minneapolis police officer and now a civilian charged with murder, kneeling into the neck of George Floyd is about as disturbing as anything most of us have ever seen. Even I-a veteran watcher of snuff films-cannot recall ever seeing someone killed in this way. (The Islamic State would stab people slowly in the heart, or smoosh them with tank treads, or burn them alive.) The only thing that has brought me close to this form of killing is Joshua Oppenheimer's singular film The Act of Killing , about executioners in Indonesia with extensive experience strangling their victims.\n\nOppenheimer asked killers to reenact their executions, to simulate their own violence. You can learn a lot from being placed in the physical arrangement of the act you are trying to understand. All commercial pilots know this: Sophisticated flight simulators enable them to experience the physical reality of certain uncommon cockpit events-wings breaking apart, engines failing, hydraulics going haywire-which allows the pilots to feel the precise number of pounds of pressure it might take to, say, lean into or pull back on a reluctant yoke.\n\nTo understand what happened to Floyd, I tried to simulate the position of his killer. My crude simulator involved a stopwatch and kneeling on a rolled-up yoga mat, on top of which I placed a gelatinous pad used by medical students to imitate human skin. (I have these things in my house.) A yoga mat and a fake-skin pad are no substitute for the neck of a dying, pleading man, and thank goodness for that. I used the times noted in the coroner's report: five minutes and 53 seconds of kneeling before officers declared that Floyd was unresponsive, followed by two minutes and 53 seconds of continued pressure. That totals just less than nine minutes.\n\nAt about 20 seconds (far sooner than I had expected), my knee started to throb. Normally when you kneel, you get to shift your weight a little, to give each knee a little vacation from the stress. If you are trying to hold down someone who does not want to be pinned, you probably want to drive your weight hard into one vulnerable place-and if you let up, you will assume that he'll wriggle around and make you start all over again. The steady pressure builds.\n\nAt about one minute, the throb turned decisively to pain and stress. I could feel my muscles rebelling, asking me why I was doing this. Standing on one foot for more than a brief period will have the same effect. Your body knows that you are pulling a stunt, that the posture is needless and uncommon.\n\nThe next three minutes felt much longer-though Chauvin, under the influence of adrenaline, perhaps experienced it much differently, as much less than three minutes. This was the time during which Floyd transitioned from begging, gasping, and drooling to unconsciousness. The physicality of kneeling was at that point not just fully painful but unfamiliar. Normal people never do this. The closest experience I've had is again from the world of livestock-holding down a calf (\"200 pounds of animated hamburger,\" as the rodeo announcers used to say in Texas) while it gets vaccinated and castrated, and resists about as much as you might expect.\n\nNow I was more than halfway to the time at which Floyd stopped responding, and Chauvin's knee, according to the charges, transformed from a tool of submission into a murder weapon. I weigh more than 200 pounds. I could imagine pinning a man with my knee, using all that force, to hold him still if necessary. But any sentient moral creature should feel that the pressure, applied like this, is an attempt to maim. The revulsion is natural: Whatever I have been leaning into is by now broken. The joint is torqued and sprained, the fascial tissue smeared or torn, the skin and muscle bruised, a major organ permanently injured or worse.\n\nAt five minutes and 53 seconds, my knee was numb. It stayed that way for the remaining minutes, and I don't see how anyone could remain in that position, knee driven into a by-now-inert mass of humanity, unless he was at best totally indifferent to the person's survival.\n\nI picked up my knee, stood up with the support of a bathroom sink, and saw that the rolled-up yoga mat had gone flat in the middle, like a toothpaste tube that has been hit with a karate chop.\n\nI have become skeptical of what (I think) I see in photos or on video. That skepticism is a civic duty and a professional one. But the evidence in this video is abnormally clear, as well as consistent with a sad record of violent policing in this country. \"Police are trained that this type of restraint with the subject in prone position is inherently dangerous,\" the criminal complaint against Chauvin says. I am glad to know the police provide this training, and I hope that they continue doing so. They might also consider screening candidates to the force to confirm that the thought of administering this type of restraint, for more than eight uninterrupted minutes, is enough to elicit some scruples."

      "text": "The Myth of the Silent Majority\n\nAmericans have learned the wrong lessons about the political consequences of protest.\n\nI drove 1,200 miles , from Philadelphia to Minneapolis, to be a part of the George Floyd protest movement. Throughout the city, from the predominantly white neighborhood of Bancroft to the more diverse streets of Bryant, I saw signs in living-room windows that read black lives matter and we stand for equality . As I drove up Cedar Avenue, heading to 38th Street, I also saw signs in the windows of stores and restaurants that read minority owned -an indication that these businesses stood with the Floyd movement, but also that they hoped to be spared should the protests turn violent.\n\nPressed together with protesters adorned in masks, I stood on the unofficially renamed George Floyd Avenue, across the street from Cup Foods, where Floyd had been killed after allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill. As I scanned the crowd, I saw what I had seen in the other cities I'd visited as I made my way west: a shockingly diverse group of protesters. As a Black man, I found myself standing next to many people who did not look like me-sometimes, their cries even drowned out my own. The coalition has changed. It has grown.\n\nOf course, not all Americans have embraced Black Lives Matter. Some look at the men and women demanding reform and see only looters and thugs. They are nurtured in this view by the president of the United States, who greeted the outcry following Floyd's murder with threats of violence against the protesters and tweets about \"LAW AND ORDER\" and the \"SILENT MAJORITY.\"\n\nRichard Nixon introduced the latter term to the American people during another moment of ferment, one to which the current unrest has been compared. During the 1968 presidential campaign and into his first years in office, as anti-war demonstrations took place across the nation, Nixon sought to ostracize the protesters, painting them as radicals whose views did not reflect those of law-abiding Americans. The term, which he introduced in a speech in 1969, cut along racial lines: The leaders of the civil-rights movement had become prominent opponents of the war in Vietnam, where a disproportionate number of Black Americans were fighting and dying. Martin Luther King Jr. went so far as to discourage Black college students from enlisting.\n\nDonald Trump borrowed from Nixon's playbook during his presidential run in 2016. During a rally in Las Vegas early in his campaign, he villainized a protester by saying, \"I would like to punch him in the face.\" The rambunctious crowd cheered in response. In the months that followed, as his campaign stops continued to be disrupted, Trump turned the protesters into a useful foil: The roaring crowd was us ; the demonstrators were them . They did not belong to the silent majority, whose prerogatives Trump intended to restore. Enterprising supporters even created signs: silent majority stands with trump . Months after the election, the signs were still available for purchase on Amazon, for the low price of $14.35, with positive reviews for the sturdiness of the paper.\n\nRead: The emerging Republican majority, 50 years later\n\nThe specter of Nixon's victory in 1968-and Trump's in 2016-has haunted the George Floyd protests. By channeling Nixon once again, Trump clearly hopes to revive his political fortunes. Polling shows that a majority of Americans view the protests positively. Trump's fractious response to the Floyd killing, coming on the heels of his administration's bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic, seems to have left him badly damaged politically.\n\nYet Trump has seemed damaged before. Some fear that, in the privacy of the voting booth, the American electorate will back the status quo over the calls for change in the streets. As of this writing, the protests have remained outraged yet largely peaceful. What if they turn violent and support for the cause they are championing erodes? \"THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!\" Trump tweeted in mid-June. But the silent majority need not be stronger than ever to reelect the president. Trump has to persuade only a small number of voters in a handful of midwestern states in order to win a second term.\n\nMy own view, having spent the past decade studying protest movements in the United States, is that we've always overestimated the power of the silent majority, and that we're giving it too much credence now. Righteous, nonviolent demonstrations are a hallmark of a functioning democracy. They provide catharsis for the participants and show the nation at large that something is wrong with our society and needs to change. Protests can also spark that change, by channeling energy, resources, and votes to candidates who take up the cause. Even 1968, the year that supposedly proves the risk of backlash, fails as an example if we consider the presidential race alongside the congressional, gubernatorial, and mayoral contests that year, which swept reform-minded politicians into office.\n\nFar from playing into Trump's hands, the demonstrators demanding justice for Floyd are engaged in a movement that is likely to aid those candidates who oppose the president's policies in November-and that could reshape American politics for years to come.\n\nI 've looked closely at how protests and elections have interacted in America since the 1960s, and I've found that protests nearly always benefit candidates associated with the causes being fought for-helping them build bigger war chests, bring more voters to the polls, and ultimately win.\n\nBoth the people marching in protests and those observing them are inspired to contribute to candidates who are perceived as being committed to change. Consider the wave of protests that followed Trump's inauguration. The most high-profile of these were the Women's March, the March for Our Lives, and the counterprotests at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. But anti-Trump protest was widespread across the United States; hundreds of events occurred in his first year in office alone. Zip code by zip code, demonstrations on behalf of liberal causes were associated with a significant increase in donations to Democratic candidates; controlling for other factors, such as neighborhood wealth, the places that saw protests saw more money flow into campaigns. Spread across the nation, political activism was the source of millions of dollars in additional campaign giving.\n\nRead: The rage unifying Boomers and Gen Z\n\nThis is not to say that protest doesn't inspire backlash. I also found a connection between liberal protests and donations to Republican candidates. But these contributions were smaller, overall. When liberal protests occur, all candidates make money. Democrats just make more of it.\n\nProtests likewise increase voter turnout. For example, although Black voters cast ballots in lower numbers in the 2016 general election than they had in 2012, the drop-off was less pronounced in areas where Black Lives Matter was active. And in areas that witnessed heightened levels of protest activity, Black voter turnout increased.\n\nAll of this energy helps candidates affiliated with protesters' goals. On average, a district that sees 50 liberal protests in an election year sees the Democratic candidate in that district increasing his or her vote share by 2 percent and the Republican decreasing his or her vote share by 7 percent compared with the previous election. In a close race, such swings can be decisive. During the 2018 midterms, eight liberal protests occurred in the average congressional district. In districts with greater protest activity, liberal candidates fared well. Sixteen liberal protests in Charleston, South Carolina; 36 in Tucson, Arizona; and 43 in Miami helped Democratic candidates Joe Cunningham, Ann Kirkpatrick, and Donna Shalala flip seats in their respective districts.\n\nThis was hardly the first time that protests had fueled successful challenges against incumbents. In the 1960s, for instance, the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam protests descended on Abner Mikva's Chicago neighborhood. Mikva did not immediately champion either cause, and he lost in his run for Congress in 1966. Over the next two years, during which Illinois's Second Congressional District was the epicenter of protest activity in the state, he reinvented himself as a strong advocate of the campaign to end racial discrimination in housing. He also acted as legal counsel for protesters jailed by an aggressive police department during anti-war protests.\n\nRead: Do protests even work?\n\nMikva's embrace of these movements rattled Chicago's Democratic machine, led by Mayor Richard Daley, who infamously ordered the police and the National Guard to crack down on protesters at the 1968 Democratic convention. Mikva unseated a superannuated Democratic incumbent during the primary and then roundly defeated his Republican challenger, even as Nixon carried Illinois. Mikva was not alone: Democratic candidates across the nation benefited from liberal protest, which helped the party maintain control of the House and the Senate.\n\nFocusing too narrowly on Nixon's victory in 1968 has also encouraged Americans to overlearn another lesson from that year: that violent protest will necessarily provoke a backlash. The fact is, many protests turn violent when the supposed enforcers of law and order do harm to demonstrators, whether it's an Alabama state trooper fracturing John Lewis's skull in Selma in 1965 or Park Police dispersing the people who congregated in Lafayette Square in 2020. Voters understand this. While wanton, opportunistic destruction of public property can certainly undermine an otherwise righteous protest movement, nightsticks, rubber bullets, and tear-gas canisters can draw attention to-and sympathy for-a cause and those brave enough to advocate for it.\n\nThe point of protest is rarely to swing a single race, however momentous that race may be. It is to change the terms of political debate, and ultimately to change society itself. And indeed, protest has always foreshadowed the most radical shifts in American history.\n\nProtest calls attention to problems with the status quo-and often spells political doom for those who have upheld it. In my research, I've found that frequent liberal protest in a given congressional district increases the probability that a serious Democratic challenger will enter the race for that seat, whether it's occupied by a Republican or a complacent Democrat. Of course, those challengers don't always carry the day. But when they do-when they are propelled into office by a protest movement-they become its institutional allies, introducing bills and supporting policies that reflect protesters' concerns. In this way, protest not only affects electoral outcomes today, but establishes the conditions for change in the future. Abner Mikva went on to be a leading progressive voice for decades and helped launch the careers of Elena Kagan and Barack Obama.\n\nThe Floyd protests likely arrived too late in the 2020 cycle to push new candidates into the field, but they have shifted the dynamics of some races, helping progressive candidates win primaries and topple entrenched incumbents such as Representative Eliot Engel of New York, who lost his race despite the support of the Democratic establishment. We will continue to see the effects of these demonstrations in years to come. When protest occurs, we can expect that change is coming-change that reflects the evolving will of the people.\n\nThis article is adapted from Daniel Q.

Lindsey Wasson, a Reuters photographer, said of the moment: \"I had just stepped to the main window of the local newspaper office, and I was looking over the crowd during a Sunday evening protest against police brutality and racism-one of several that had rocked Seattle and other places across the United States since the death of George Floyd-when I heard a scream and commotion. I rushed to the window to photograph what was happening. Stunned protesters surrounded a car that had driven into their ranks. A man brandishing a gun exited the driver's side of the vehicle and the protesters backed away from him as he ran off and melted into the crowd. Medics rushed forward to help a wounded man lying on the ground nearby. Everything happened very quickly, maybe only a minute or so. It has been very odd to see protests like this in my hometown.

It was very difficult to photograph people's expressions as they wore masks, but as the horse-drawn carriage bearing Floyd's casket passed on its way to the cemetery, I heard someone screaming.

A Black protester emerged from the melee, walking briskly toward me, carrying a white man with injuries to his face in a fireman's lift over his shoulder. The anti-racism protests in London that Saturday had been fluid and unpredictable. After witnessing sporadic, minor clashes between demonstrators and police in Trafalgar Square, I switched attention to nearby Waterloo Bridge, where several hundred anti-racism protesters had gathered. There was a traffic jam going from south to north, but the vibe was good-cars were honking and people were celebrating. The mood quickly turned ugly when they encountered a group of counterprotesters and clashes broke out. I saw a skirmish and someone falling to the ground before the two men appeared through the crowd. Some people shouted out that the assault victim was a member of the far-right. Reuters journalists at the scene said he had been beaten in a skirmish with anti-racism protesters. Patrick Hutchinson has been hailed a hero for carrying the injured man to safety during the scuffle. 'It was the right thing to do,' he told Reuters later.

I was following Dr. Varon and his team as they intubated two patients with worsening conditions. The first intubation went smoothly. We walked into the second patient's room and almost as soon as they began the procedure, his heart rate dropped. The air was filled with anxiety. I was in a corner of the room with my camera and it wasn't until two medical students jumped onto the bed and began administering chest compressions that I realized the patient was dying. The whole scene took place over the course of 30 minutes as we all nervously watched the clock and his heart rate monitor. Although this patient was surrounded by people while he died, they were faceless doctors in hazmat suits. He wasn't able to say goodbye to his family, friends, and the people who cared about him. I looked him up later on Facebook, and his profile picture had a filter on it that said, 'I'm an essential worker, I can't stay home.' I often think about him and the likelihood that he contracted the coronavirus at work. I hope his image and his story resonate with people and show why it's important to wear a mask and stay at home to protect those that can't.\" #\n\nAn aerial view of the Kwanyin Temple in the middle of the flooded Yangtze River on July 24, 2020, in Ezhou, China.

      "text": "DOJ Skewers Minneapolis Cops-Exposing Years of Racism and Excessive Force\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nA scathing report released by the DOJ on Friday exposed a slew of troubling conduct by the Minneapolis Police Department -revealing \"systemic problems\" of excessive force and discrimination that preceded George Floyd's murder by cops in 2020.\n\nThe report was conducted by the feds in the aftermath of Floyd's slaying, totaling 89 pages after a two-year probe into the embattled department.\n\n\"Our investigation found that the systemic problems in MPD made what happened to George Floyd possible,\" the report stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmong the most shocking revelations was that Minneapolis cops patrolled neighborhoods differently based on the racial makeup of its residents-increasing their presence and arrests in areas made up of Black and Native American people.\n\nThe feds accused Minneapolis police of using \"dangerous tactics and weapons,\" like neck restraints and Tasers, on people accused of a petty crime or no offense at all-much like what happened to Floyd before his encounter turned deadly.\n\nThe report also uncovered that Minneapolis police regularly retaliated against those who criticized the department, and sometimes singled out those with behavioral health disabilities to give harsher punishment.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced the report's release in a press conference Friday, summarizing it by saying, \"Patterns and practices we observed made what happened to George Floyd possible.\"\n\nGarland said the investigation revealed violations of the first and fourth amendments, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Safe Streets Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act by the department.\n\nThe report said the department's response to misconduct issues were as bad as the conduct itself. It called the department's accountability structures \"fundamentally flawed,\" adding that internal probes were lost in an \"opaque maze,\" with department leaders routinely dismissing legitimate complaints without investigation.\n\n\"These systemic issues didn't just occur on May 25th, 2020,\" Garland said, referencing Floyd's murder. \"There were instances like that being reported by the community long before that.\"\n\nAG Merrick Garland announces DoJ investigation following the death of George Floyd found the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern of \"using excessive force\" and \"unlawfully discriminating against Black and Native American people.\" pic.twitter.com/yZAEFCcfQr\n\nGarland said the DOJ came to an agreement with Minneapolis cops to negotiate toward a consent decree-a court-enforceable reform agreement that'd force the department to better its practices and policies or face consequences. It's unclear when the decree is expected to be enacted, or what its exact orders will be.\n\n\"The community will be deeply engaged every step of the way,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said about the decree. \"We will take an input from the community, from stakeholders, and from law enforcement.\"\n\nBrian O'Hara, Minneapolis' police chief since September, told reporters Friday that he's \"incredibly thankful\" the DOJ did a \"deep dive\" into his department's issues.\n\n\"Out of the darkness and trauma our residents and our police officers have experienced over the last three years, we will emerge as a beacon of light for the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "George Floyd's Uncle Tells How Nephew's Death Changed His Life\n\nEvery day, Selwyn Jones misses his nephew, George Floyd .\n\nToday marks four years since Floyd, 46, was killed while in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department. In death, he has become a martyr-a symbol of the oppression and violence routinely visited on Black people by the forces of law and order.\n\nBut to his uncle, he was a big, good-natured guy who loved to laugh. That's the person Jones misses seeing and talking to, he told The Daily Beast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJones said he was playing softball in Gettysburg, S.D., the small town in the center of the state where he lives, when he learned of his nephew's death under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nFloyd's death inspired Jones to start campaigning against police violence, as well as speaking out against domestic violence, gun violence and sex trafficking.\n\n\"I'm trying to make a difference,\" Jones said.\n\nHe has made numerous appearances across the country and conducted countless media interviews. Jones said he feels a duty to speak up so other families don't have to endure the pain he has been forced to live with for the last four years.\n\n\"It's been absolutely chaotic ever since,\" he said.\n\nJones started by appearing at demonstrations over Floyd's death in Rapid City and Sioux Falls that week. He asked for the events to be nonviolent, but the Sioux Falls rally, which had been peaceful, ended in chaos with some people storming a mall and Gov. Kristi Noem calling in the National Guard.\n\nA plea for non-violence during demonstrations from Selwyn Jones (George Floyd's uncle) and several peaceful protestors. #CommunityFirst\n\nSince then, Jones has toured the country, appearing in Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and other major cities. He also has launched a podcast called Setting It Straight , was featured in GQ magazine in 2020, and now has a media consultant, George Savage of New York City, who describes himself as \"an international publicity ninja and strategist.\"\n\nOn April 18, Jones took part in a Harvard University symposium, called \"Channeling Grief Into Activism\" that also featured Gwen Carr. She is the mother of the late Eric Garner , a 43-year-old Black man who was put in a chokehold by New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo on July 17, 2014. Garner was accused of selling single cigarettes without a tax stamp.\n\nHe said \"I can't breathe,\" 11 times but Pantaleo would not loosen his grip. No criminal charges were filed, but Pantaleo was fired five years later, and the city paid Garner's family a reported multi-million-dollar settlement.\n\nJones, 58, said he feels an obligation to continue to speak out. He was not involved in civil rights activism before his nephew's death, and said he is still not interested in politics. But this is something he must do, Jones said, so he will go where he is invited to lend his voice.\n\n\"Oh my God, man, you name it, I've been at it,\" he said. \"I've been continuously fighting the battle.\"\n\nSelwyn Jones, uncle of George Floyd, speaks with reporters in front of the Hennepin County Public Safety Facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nJones had been a vacuum cleaner salesman who also played professional indoor football. When he came to South Dakota, he switched his focus from football to softball, and he and his wife, JoLynda Jean Jones, bought a hotel, KJ's Inn and Suites .\n\nIt was a relaxed, low-key life and Jones was content. Then came the events of May 25, 2020. Jones spoke out against the murder of his nephew and he became well-known in South Dakota.\n\nHe objected to the inclusion of the Confederate flag on the Gettysburg police logo, uniforms and vehicles. It was added in 2009, the same year Barack Obama was sworn in as president.\n\nTown officials said that was a coincidence. They said Gettysburg, founded in 1883, two decades after the famous Civil War battle, was merely honoring its heritage. Jones said the rebel flag did not belong.\n\nAfter a brief public debate, it was removed from the logo, uniforms and vehicles.\n\nJones said his opposition to the logo has not been forgotten. A racist insult was scrawled on a wall in town, and he said some local residents are still angry about the change.\n\n\"We got it taken off, but people are mad a Black man had something taken from their town. I went from being a good dude to a piece of trash,\" he said. \"That's the power and control issue.\"\n\nJones said South Dakota is a deeply racist state.\n\n\"It's not underlying racism,\" he said. \"It's full racism.\"\n\nHe said when he speaks around the country, people are excited. They want to see \"Uncle Selwyn\" as he refers to himself.\n\nBut not in the state where he lives-\"because of how people are,\" he said.\n\nJones said despite what locals think of him he has no plans to leave South Dakota. He likes the slower pace of life and is content with his home and business.\n\n\"I've worked too hard for this. I've worked too hard for my house and for what I've got,\" he said. \"Nobody's going to chase me out. I never let anybody judge me by the color of my skin. I'm a proud Black man.\"\n\nHe has made some appearances in South Dakota, speaking at a couple of colleges in the state, and meeting with the Rapid City police chief in 2020.\n\nPeople raise their fists following the guilty verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin on April 20, 2021, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThere have been other challenges for Jones.\n\nOn June 10, 2023 he was found unresponsive in his hotel, with marijuana, two methamphetamine pipes and other drug paraphernalia nearby. Jones was treated by emergency responders, and then was taken into custody by the Gettysburg Police Department. A search warrant was then served, with multiple law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nJones was indicted by a Potter County grand jury on two felony and two misdemeanor counts. He is free on a personal recognizance bond.\n\nTarin James, 32, of Gettysburg, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, ingesting controlled substance, possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia.\n\nJones did not want to discuss the arrest in detail, saying it was an \"ongoing investigation\" and he expects all charges to be dismissed.\n\n\"I was a victim of someone I thought was a friend of mine,\" he told The Daily Beast. \"Don't believe everything you read. I'm fine, I'm absolutely fine. I've been put in some bad situations only because I'm George Floyd's uncle and I'm Black.\"\n\nHe talks about his nephew to promote the causes he cares about, but he also reflects on the life of his sister, Larceina Floyd, who died in 2019. George was one of her five children, Selwyn said.\n\nWhile they lived in different parts of the country-Jones in North Carolina and South Dakota, and Floyd in Texas and Minnesota-they talked often and saw each other several times a year, Jones said.\n\n\"I was an uncle. You can talk to uncles about girls and doing things,\" he said. \"I seen George, depending on when it was needed.\"\n\nJones said his nephew was fun to be around and loved to \"laugh and joke, because that was free.\"\n\nJones said he misses seeing and talking with his nephew. There are specific things he recalls when talking about him.\n\n\"His laugh. His smile,\" he said. \"His bigness.\"\n\nIn death, George Floyd has become famous and his name resonates across the country. But Jones said that doesn't provide much comfort.\n\n\"He would have traded it, every second, because this is not what he wanted,\" he said. \"This isn't a group you want to be in.\"\n\nGot a tip?

He said that Minneapolis jurors were pushed to find him guilty to avoid threats of violence against them and their families.\n\nHis attorney wrote, \"Mr. Chauvin's case shows the profound difficulties trial courts have to ensure a criminal defendant's right to an impartial jury consistently when extreme cases arise.\"\n\nIn a separate trial, Chauvin pleaded guilty to federal charges that he violated Floyd's civil rights.

      "text": "A Cellphone Was the Only Hero at George Floyd's Murder\n\nCandace Owens, the Black conservative commentator, was right when she said that George Floyd is no hero. He isn't. But our digital age certainly made him a martyr. It was the cell phone video captured by 17-year-old high school student Darnella Frazier that served as incontrovertible evidence of Floyd's slaughter and sparked the process of converting a struggling, middle-aged addict with a prison record into a symbol, a touchstone, an icon, his name recited by children in classrooms, his face painted in colorful tribute on city walls, his soul prayed for in churches, synagogues, and mosques the world over. We almost didn't need to wait for the wheels of justice to turn. Derek Chauvin's fate, at least in the court of public opinion, was sealed the moment that Frazier aimed her camera at him, confirming the cell phone camera as society's newest surveillance tool, one capable of exposing all manner of injustice, whether that be an overzealous security guard at a strip club or a police officer committing murder on a Minneapolis street.\n\nOnce her name was known, Frazier, too, was being hailed for her courage, her own GoFundMe page raising over half a million dollars to provide \"peace and healing\" for the trauma brought on by what she had witnessed and for the continuing trauma from the digital age's unique form of insults and threats, which she endured long afterward. \"It's been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more,\" she said, \"and not physically interacting and not saving his life.\" And what a modern thought that is, that somehow the camera was an agent to the crime. In the age of the cyberwarrior, it's hard to be a truth teller.\n\nDarnella Frazier (3rd R) uses her mobile phone to record the arrest of George Floyd, in a still image taken from Minneapolis Police body camera video in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. May 25, 2020.\n\nBut let's be clear: Floyd did not act the hero here. In fact, he was brutally acted upon. And Frazier's presence at this historic moment was an accident. She was there to accompany her nine-year-old cousin, who wanted snacks from Cup Foods but was too young to go on her own. It took presence of mind for her to point her cell phone camera at the scene, while she, along with a small sidewalk crowd, scolded the police for what they were doing. And it took a steely perseverance for her to continue to point the camera while she watched a man die before her very eyes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile it was Floyd's still image that would proliferate later, it was the video itself, posted on Facebook, that changed the world. Without the cell phone at her disposal, Frazier and the other bystanders could only have described what they saw, and memory, being at best a subjective tool for discovering the truth, too often falls victim to the dictates of power. That's because the recall of witnesses to crime must first go through a hierarchy of believability, one that enhances or discounts testimony according to cultural signals like race, gender, economic standing, authority, presentation, articulateness, and personality. Given all that, what are the chances that a hypothetical Darnella Frazier from a time before cell phones, recalling to a judge or jury the deadly assault she saw committed on a hypothetical George Floyd, would have been believed over the testimony of a white male law enforcement officer like Derek Chauvin and the blue wall of silence built to protect him?\n\nWe are greeted each day by a bombardment of imagery, much of it manipulated and distorted to make us feel certain feelings and do certain things, like spend unlimited money and believe in implausible conspiracies. But while we've grown increasingly suspicious of the truthfulness of the picture, for the moment, at least, unedited raw video still has the quality of record. Raw video shot by a mere bystander-not a professional, not an activist with an agenda-arriving at the scene by chance and recording a violent injustice committed in her presence is even more believable, more reliable, since our reaction presupposes that there is no pretense or ego, no fashion or framing, no interpretive gaze or willful finger-pointing. Just the truth.\n\nPeople raise their fists and hold a portrait of George Floyd during a rally following the guilty verdict the trial of Derek Chauvin on April 20, 2021, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nIn 1945, when the British photojournalist George Rodger arrived on assignment in Germany at the Bergen-Belsen extermination camp-the first photographer to get there-he felt ashamed to be looking through his viewfinder to assemble \"thousands of Jewish corpses into nice photographic compositions,\" and thereafter refused to cover war and its aftermath. But a camera held by an innocent, the accidental photojournalist who has become a hallmark of our time, is another thing entirely. In Darnella Frazier's hands, the video becomes merely the transfer of what happened then to our eyes now as we open it from our inbox, watch it on cable television, or glimpse it from a post found on our own cell phones. All of which means that when it comes to the abuse of power, at least as it's rendered in public spaces, you can no longer hide. The camera- some camera -will always be there to remember you.\n\nThe video shot by Frazier provides an interesting study. By comparison, consider, first, how in 2015, Walter Scott, a 50-year-old African American, was stopped by a North Charleston, South Carolina, cop for having a broken taillight. Scott, fearing arrest, fled on foot, and Officer Michael Slager ran after him. It was fairly early in the morning, and while Scott's car was parked in the lot of an auto parts store, he had run behind a metal fence near the back side of a pawn shop where there appeared to be no one in sight, Slager right behind him in pursuit.\n\nYet it turned out that there was someone present. Feidin Santana, a Dominican barber on his way to work, noticed the commotion, reached for his phone, and recorded the entire scene. The video Santana captured shows Slager shoot Scott eight times in the back, killing him. The officer then approaches Scott's body, checks for a pulse, and finally runs to retrieve his Taser and put it near the scene. This was done to fit the lie that Scott had been struggling to grab it from him and that Slager had been forced to kill him in self-defense. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" Slager says into his radio. \"He grabbed my Taser.\"\n\nBy contrast, Darnella Frazier's video of George Floyd's death has no apparent narrative. It tells no clear story. It's just a single scene showing a white police officer with his knee on the neck of a Black man lying prone on the pavement, his head pinned next to the right rear tire of the police cruiser. The officer has his hand in his pocket and his sunglasses perched on his head while he looks off nonchalantly. But here's the key: While it's a single scene, the video goes on for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds.\n\nNo moral person can escape the gruesome awkwardness of watching it, the unpleasant feeling that even voyeuristic detachment cannot shield you from some level of responsibility for what you're seeing. In fact, viewing it, you have the sense that you, yourself, are guilty of a crime-which, in a way, if you believe in the spirit of the collective, we all are. There is even something of a crucifixion to it, a long, slow, painful end, carried out in public, with both official and unofficial viewers in attendance and a common cry from the dying-Christ for his \"father,\" Floyd for his recently departed \"mama.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd speaks to Darnella Frazier after a service honoring the life of her uncle, Leneal Frazier, on July 19, 2021 in Minneapolis. Frazier, the uncle of Darnella Frazier, was killed earlier this month when his car was struck by a Minneapolis Police officer engaged in a pursuit through the city's north side.\n\nWhere the film of the Walter Scott shooting tells a story, there the killing happens in an instant. But with Floyd, the killing is the story, and, while the time elapsed is essential to its power, the focus on a single, unchanging scene also gives it the quality of an iconic still photograph or even a piece of sculpture. A man has his knee on another man's neck. That man is dying. The two could have been carved of Carrara marble and put on view in a museum or a public square, a mordantly askew rendering of the Pieta, with the Madonna and child replaced by the executioner and his prey. It matters not who they are, really-George Floyd and Derek Chauvin-only that they're symbolic of a larger whole. And the symbolism is crucial to the reaction that the scene provokes, for one cannot read this arresting image, moving or still, without concluding that the death of George Floyd is neither surprising nor unusual. Its power is in its very ordinariness. It's a rendering of the whole sorry relationship between Black and white in America and, even more, the whole perverse relationship between the powerful and the powerless throughout the world. Indeed, no picture since the June 5, 1989 confrontation between a lone man with shopping bags and a parade of tanks-\"Tank Man,\" as he came to be known, since his identity was never discovered-under the heat of the Tiananmen Square protests in China has had so much international resonance.\n\nExcerpted from Seen and Unseen: Technology, Social Media, and the Fight for Racial Justice by Marc Lamont Hill and Todd Brewster.

      "text": "'The Whole World Is Watching': Chauvin's Murder Trial Isn't Just About George Floyd\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nWhile the world watched Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin pin George Floyd to the ground by the knee for more than eight minutes last May, Amity Dimock was still awaiting answers about the death of her own child at the hands of Minnesota police.\n\nIn August 2019, her son, Kobe Dimock-Heisler, was shot six times by two Brooklyn Park police officers responding to a \"disturbance call\" at his grandparents' house. The 21-year-old, who was on the autism spectrum and had a history of mental illness, had lost his temper and eventually turned his anger on his grandfather, Erwin Heisler.\n\nFearing for his grandson's safety, Heisler called the cops. By the time two officers arrived, Kobe had calmed down, so Heisler tried to send them away, but they forced themselves inside anyway, the grandfather said. During a tense conversation in the living room, Kobe lunged for something hidden in the couch cushions. Officers later said they thought he was grabbing a knife-and responded by shooting him three times in the chest and neck.\n\n\"They shot him in the head. In front of his grandmother,\" Amity Dimock, a 47-year-old accountant, told The Daily Beast. \"It was the worst day of my life.\"\n\nOn Aug. 5, nearly a year after the young man's death, the Hennepin County Attorney 's office announced they would not file charges against the two officers who shot him. It took the same prosecutors just four days to charge Chauvin in Floyd's murder amid a nationwide outcry.\n\n\"It's beyond frustrating. My son's case was just sitting on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman's desk while they hopped, skipped, and jumped over it to prioritize George Floyd's case,\" Dimock added. \"When George Floyd died, he was all over the news. Celebrities, reporters, even politicians were saying Floyd's name. I just kept thinking, 'Why aren't they also saying my son's name?'\"\n\nDimock is just one of the hundreds of Twin Cities residents who have lost loved ones at the hands of local law enforcement in the past two decades. Now, they are focusing their attention on Chauvin, one of the four officers fired for his involvement in Floyd's May 25 death.\n\n\"For so long, hundreds of people have been brutally murdered by police officers in Minnesota,\" Toshira Garraway, who founded Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence after her fiancé was killed by cops, told The Daily Beast. \"All of these families are worked up right now and they are scared because we are just hoping for once in our life we can see justice with Derek Chauvin's conviction.\"\n\nOn Monday-less than a year after a video of Floyd's death went viral-the former Minneapolis police officer's long-awaited trial was set to begin in a Hennepin County courthouse. The high-profile case is now in the hands of the Minnesota Attorney General's office, after a judge banned Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and his staff from the case in September, citing their previous \"sloppy\" work.\n\nChauvin faces two charges, second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, for violently arresting Floyd over a counterfeit $20 bill. He faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nBut on Monday, jury selection was delayed after the Minnesota Court of Appeals on Friday ruled that the previously tossed third-degree murder charge against Chauvin should be reinstated. During a Monday hearing prior to jury selection, which was scheduled to roughly take three weeks, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill, who ruled against the third-degree murder charge last year, said he wanted to hear from the state Court of Appeals about whether the new charge could be added to Chauvin's case. Prosecutors agreed with the delay, stating any logistical loose ends in the case before the trial could result in grounds for an appeal.\n\nChauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, also said Monday he intends to ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to consider the third-degree murder ruling, which would delay the trial. That appeal could further delay arguments are scheduled to start March 29.\n\n\"I want to inform the court that we're prepared to try this case,\" he said. \"It is not our intent to cause delay. However, I feel I have an ethical obligation to my client to [petition the Supreme Court].\"\n\nAt trial, prosecutors will argue Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for roughly nine minutes-including nearly three minutes in which Floyd was unresponsive.\n\n\"Please, please, please, I can't breathe. Please, man,\" Floyd said in the viral body-camera footage, which didn't show the beginning of the arrest. \"I'm about to die.\"\n\nEMTs said that he had no pulse when he was loaded into an ambulance. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner concluded Floyd died of cardiac arrest from the restraint and neck compression, also noting that Floyd had heart disease and there was fentanyl in his system. An independent report commissioned by Floyd's family concluded that the 46-year-old died of strangulation from the pressure to his back and neck. Both reports determined Floyd's death was a homicide.\n\nThree other officers-Tou Thao, Thomas K. Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng-assisted with the arrest, holding down Floyd's legs and trying to keep concerned bystanders at bay. They've been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder while committing a felony, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence, and are expected to face a trial together in August.\n\n\"This case will be remembered as one of the most egregious police brutality cases in the history of America,\" Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the Floyd family, told The Daily Beast. \"This case will be a referendum on where America is on equal justice.\"\n\nChauvin's lawyer, who did not respond to The Daily Beast's multiple requests for comment, has previously argued that it was not his client's fault Floyd died-instead blaming it on the other rookie cops who he said should have called an ambulance sooner or \"chosen to de-escalate\" the situation.\n\n\"If EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr. Floyd may have survived,\" Nelson wrote in a September filing . \"If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr. Floyd may have survived.\"\n\nThe 10-minute video of Floyd's death sent shockwaves through social media, erupting the already simmering anger about racial injustice and police brutality in the U.S. and prompting people to take to the streets in protest. Floyd's final pleas became a rallying cry, bringing renewed energy to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"This case speaks to a larger conversation-and its outcome will have a big impact on public policy to come. This is extremely high stakes,\" Mike Lawlor, an associate professor at the University of New Haven and a former prosecutor, told The Daily Beast. \"It's almost like a political event, not just a judicial one because this trial will be a catalyst one way or another.\"\n\nJonathan Smith, the executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, said \"the prosecution knows the whole world is watching.\"\n\n\"If they don't convict, it will be devastating for prosecutors,\" he told The Daily Beast, adding that the video of Floyd's death is \"very powerful\" and will be for any jury.\n\nBut the pathway to conviction will still be an \"uphill battle,\" Smith warns, because while it is easier to show that Chauvin used excessive force that deprived Floyd's civil rights, proving it was \"willful\" is a more difficult challenge.\n\n\"Willfulness is the highest intent standard under criminal law,\" Smith, a former official in the DOJ's civil rights division, said. \"To do so, prosecutors need to prove Chauvin actually knew that he was going to violate someone's rights and acted with purpose. Chauvin's behavior on camera, though, is going to help the prosecution. He was mocking people who were taping the video and that is powerful evidence.\"\n\nFloyd's trial could have major implications for how other officers who use deadly force will be dealt with since there are so few police brutality cases that actually make it to trial.\n\n\"There really isn't precedent here,\" Smith, who also led the independent investigation into Elijah McClain's death in Colorado, added. \"So while it's a win that this case made it to trial, that means it's a bigger hill to fall if he gets an acquittal.\"\n\nThere are many who fear that outcome, like Ira Toles, one of several people who has accused Chauvin of brutally attacking them in the years before Floyd's death.\n\n\"I might have to take justice into my own hands,\" Toles said, noting he has been denied the justice he deserves for over 13 years.\n\nAccording to Communities United Against Police Brutality, 10 complaints were filed against Chauvin in his 19 years with the police, but he only ever received two verbal reprimands. The city's Civilian Review Authority, which lists complaints prior to September 2012, also shows five more were filed against Chauvin-and all closed without discipline. Violent incidents in Chauvin's past included the 2006 fatal shooting of 42-year-old Wayne Reyes and the 2011 non-fatal shooting of a Native American man.\n\nAs previously reported by The Daily Beast, Chauvin barged into Toles' home unannounced during a 2008 domestic violence call and beat him up in the bathroom-before shooting him in the stomach . Toles, then 21, blacked out during the assault and collapsed at the front door, where he remained bleeding until paramedics came. While Toles pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, Chauvin continued his career with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.\n\n\"He tried to kill me in that bathroom,\" Toles said in May.\n\nHe's skeptical of real change coming from Chauvin's trial. Toles told The Daily Beast last week that it won't immediately change a criminal justice system that seems to disfavor minority communities.\n\nFor Garraway, the founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, the uniqueness of this case also provides a rare national spotlight on Minnesota-a state with \"a major problem\" with police brutality. Among the countless other cases she says have gone unnoticed is the death of her fiancé Justin Teigen, who was killed by St. Paul police after a traffic stop in August 2009.\n\nAccording to police reports, Teigen fled from officers during a traffic stop and crashed his car before trying to run away on foot. Hours later, he was found in a nearby garbage bin. The medical examiner and police say he died of asphyxia due to mechanical compression by a recycling truck that he'd been hiding in. Garraway believes that police beat him up before dumping him in the trash.\n\nNow, 12 years later, she works with other families who have lost their loved ones to police brutality in Minnesota. But while she hopes Chauvin's trial shows the world that police brutality \"is not an isolated issue in Minnesota,\" she isn't confident jurors will hold the ex-cop accountable.\n\n\"Even if they do give justice for George Floyd, it may be only because politicians are scared of the aftermath,\" she said. \"Not even because it's the right thing to do. But because this is the first time that it has spiraled out of control.\"\n\n\"Chauvin is a white man who killed a Black man and when the Constitution was written-that wasn't a crime,\" she added.\n\nThe high stakes of Chauvin's trial are especially felt by the Floyd family, who are anxious about getting justice for their loved one-and hopeful about what it could mean for police reform and Black Americans across the country, Crump said.\n\n\"All eyes are on the prosecutors,\" he added. \"History has taught us that when a police officer kills a Black person-not much happens. But we're confident the video and witnesses who saw George Floyd's death are enough for a conviction.\n\n\"And if we don't get one: I would expect there will be a global outcry,\" he added.\n\nThe trial is taking place just as the Minneapolis City Council is about to consider a proposal that would dramatically overhaul how the city handles public safety.\n\nIn the wake of Floyd's killing and the protests and riots that followed, nine City Council members joined a rally in Powderhorn Park and pledged to dissolve the police department, replacing it with a new \"model\" to be determined over the next year.\n\nThat effort was derailed in December when the Charter Commission, a committee appointed by a judge to oversee any changes to the city's charter or constitution, determined by a vote of 10-5 that the council had acted too soon to place the issue before voters on last November's ballot.\n\nSmaller reforms that activists had pushed for did come to pass: The city banned chokeholds, overhauled the police use of force policy by requiring officers to consider alternatives, prohibited officers from engaging in car chases for minor offenses, and more than doubled the funding for the Office of Violence Prevention, the kind of social program activists argue is underfunded compared with police budgets. (According to The Star Tribune , The Office of Violence Prevention went from a budget of $2.5 million to $7.4 million, while MPD's budget stands at $164 million).\n\nBut the debate over police reform has come as Minneapolis, like many major cities, experiences a surge in violent crime and homicides, dividing community groups and residents. Some see the crime wave as a reason to support more police funding, others point to Floyd's death and the department's troubled history as reasons to consider alternatives.\n\nIn late January, three council members introduced a new proposal to change the city's charter, again eliminating the police department, but this time replacing it with a broader public safety department that would include police but also violence prevention programs, mental health services, and specialized response for unsheltered people. The proposal went to a committee hearing on Thursday and would need to pass the full council and a Charter Commission review before going to voters-though the commission could not delay it from going to the ballot.\n\nThe timing of the proposal being introduced just before the trial was coincidental, but Councilmember Steve Fletcher, one of the three who introduced it, told The Daily Beast that the trial is \"stirring up a lot of emotions.\"\n\n\"As the city where George Floyd was killed we have an obligation to move deliberately and with intention and persistence to change the system, and we are continuing to move forward at every opportunity to create the kind of transformation that our community is demanding,\" he said.\n\nActivists who support the proposal aren't just counting on the council to pass it. In a parallel effort, a coalition of groups is running a campaign to gather enough signatures to get a similar proposal-one that would also replace the police department with a broader public safety department-on the November ballot. If the petition effort is successful, the council members have said they will drop their effort to avoid overlap.\n\nFor D.A. Bullock, a spokesperson with Reclaim the Block, one of the key groups that organized protests after Floyd's killing, the proposals are the culmination of years of police killings and protests in Minneapolis.\n\n\"The charter proposal to create a new public safety department is just a logical acknowledgment of the general public belief that we cannot go back to what brought us to the murder of George Floyd,\" Bullock said.\n\n\"The Minneapolis Police have proven time and time again that they can not be trusted with exclusive responsibility for our public safety.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\njaredmgo@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Tucker Carlson: Convicted Murderer Derek Chauvin Didn't Murder George Floyd\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted in April 2021 of murdering George Floyd, but on Tuesday night Fox News host Tucker Carlson insisted that Chauvin didn't murder anyone, complaining that \"we have to pretend\" like he did.\n\nSpeaking to Fox colleague Laura Ingraham, who was in Minneapolis and had spoken with a pair of police officers, Carlson asked about conditions in the city more than two years after the protests and riots in the wake of Floyd's murder.\n\n\"I was stunned at how bad it is in certain parts of Minneapolis,\" Ingraham said, adding later that the situation was \"all too predictable.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"[In the] 3rd Precinct, [officers] are still operating out of a school,\" she said. \"They don't even have a permanent presence, a permanent building structure in Minneapolis to this day. This is like 26 months after Floyd was killed, and you can feel it in the officers. They are trying to put on a brave face and they are great people.\"\n\nCarlson then suggested that companies like Nike, Google, and Facebook should help rebuild the city since, as he put it, \"big companies pay for\" the riots that occurred in May and June 2020.\n\nIngraham responded that some have helped, but small businesses \"get the short end of the stick.\"\n\n\"I am shocked,\" she continued. \"One diner I'm going to take people to-Derek Chauvin actually worked... in the club above it-that was burned to the ground. So I go to that same location and I said, 'Where is the rebuild?' It's just weeds, a lot of weeds now. Nothing, nothing has been done. Shocking.\"\n\nCarlson, who claimed last February -months before the Chauvin verdict-that Floyd's death was an \"utter lie\" and a \"carefully concocted myth,\" apparently still hasn't accepted the verdict.\n\n\"So they destroy the city, they put this cop in prison for the rest of his life, we all have to pretend he committed murder-which he didn't, but whatever, we have to pretend it-and then they leave and they move on to the next thing to destroy,\" Carlson whined.\n\nEarlier in the segment, Carlson insisted that \"the medical examiner apparently determined\" that Floyd died from a fentanyl overdose, when in fact the Hennepin County medical examiner and experts hired by Floyd's family each determined that his death was a homicide.\n\nDerek Chauvin, who is serving a 22-1/2-year sentence for Floyd's murder, also pleaded guilty last December to federal charges of depriving Floyd of his civil rights, resulting in a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently.\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

We speak with Washington Post reporters Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa, who have just published an in-depth new book, \"His Name Is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice,\" that tells the story of structural racism in the U.S. through Floyd's own story. \"This is an American story.

I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nThis week marks the second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd. Nine minutes and 29 seconds, that's how long Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck on Memorial Day 2020. Floyd was handcuffed face-down on the pavement, not resisting, as he gasped for air, begging for his life. A teenager named Darnella Frazier recorded cellphone video of their actions and helped spark global protests demanding justice.\n\nDerek Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison for murdering George Floyd. Three other former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty of violating Floyd's civil rights as they ignored his repeated pleas of \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nToday we remember George Floyd, the man himself and his impact. He died in Minneapolis, but he spent much of his life in Houston, Texas, where he's remembered for his efforts to break the cycle of violence in his community by mentoring young men. This social media post from George Floyd, in his own words, captures the type of outreach he did.\n\nGEORGE FLOYD : I want to speak to y'all real quick. I just want to say, man, that I got my shortcomings and my flaws, and I ain't better than nobody else. But, man, the shootings that's going on, man, I don't care what hood you're from, man, or where you're at, man. I love you, and God love you, man. Put them guns down, man. That ain't what it is, you know. God bless, man, and y'all holy out here, though, man. You got parents out here selling plates, man, trying to bury their kids, man. Think about it, man. Love y'all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Love y'all,\" or \"I love you.\" George Floyd in his own words, repeated those words over and over as a greeting, as a goodbye. After his killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, there were protests worldwide and in all 50 states. In Houston, more than 60,000 people honored George Floyd. Mayor Sylvester Turner addressed the march.\n\nMAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER : Today is about lifting up the family of George Floyd. Say his name.\n\nPROTESTERS : George Floyd!\n\nMAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER : Say his name.\n\nPROTESTERS : George Floyd!\n\nMAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER : It's about lifting up the name of George Floyd.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we're joined by the co-authors of a new book titled His Name Is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice . Robert Samuels and Tolu Olorunnipa are reporters for The Washington Post whose deeply researched book tells both Floyd's own story, as well as the history of the United States through this one man, who said, since he was a boy, he hoped to touch the world. The book also addresses slavery, housing, education, healthcare and, of course, police violence.\n\nRobert Samuels and Tolu Olorunnipa, we welcome you both to Democracy Now! What an astounding journey you take us on. This is also simply a history book of institutionalized racism in the United States. Toluse, I was wondering if you can begin in North Carolina, because that's where George Floyd was born. But you don't start with George, or, as his family called him, Perry's birth; you go back to slavery times, to George Floyd's family enslaved in this country.\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : Yeah. And it's so great to be with you.\n\nAnd I'm glad you started with that question, because in order to tell George Floyd's story, we needed to rewind the tape to the 19th century. George Floyd's great-great-grandfather was born enslaved. That's how far back the records go in terms of what we were able to find. And his great-great-grandfather was born enslaved but received his freedom after the Civil War. And he was someone who was hard-working. He worked incredibly hard in this country, and he was able to amass 500 acres of land in the late 19th century as a Black man. And that is something that was almost unheard of. It made him one of the most wealthiest Black men in that stretch of North Carolina.\n\nAnd if this was a normal story, George Floyd would have been the heir to that fortune. He would have been - he would have come into the world quite wealthy as a result of the generational wealth that passed down. That's how wealth is built in this country. That's how many people came into the world wealthy, because of their hard-working ancestors. But, unfortunately, George Floyd's great-great-grandfather had all of his land taken from him through fraudulent tax schemes and unscrupulous business deals by white farmers and white landowners who wanted to take advantage of him and didn't like the fact that there was a wealthy Black man going around their community. This was a time of racial terror in the country at the turn of the century, around the time of the Tulsa race riots and a number of different things happening, and George Floyd's great-great-grandfather lost all of his land, and he was unable to pass any of that land down. And what did that do to the rest of George Floyd's ancestry? It meant the next couple of generations, before George Floyd came to scene, were made up of sharecroppers who lived in poverty despite working hard for years and years and years. And George Floyd was not able to inherit any of the benefits of the hard work of his ancestors the way many people have been able to benefit from the hard work that's built up over generations.\n\nSo this is an American story. It shows how American poverty works, how American wealth works. And George Floyd was on the wrong side of the line because of the color of his skin, because of the color of the skin of his ancestors. And it was important for us to show that. We also did a comparative analysis of the family that owned and abused Floyd's ancestors, and showed how they were able to build wealth. They were able to be quite wealthy and pass down generational wealth. And that really explains how, even though people say slavery was a long time ago, it still has reverberations and impacts on the 21st century.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Robert Samuels, this is a profound book that everyone in this country needs to read. I mean, ultimately, it also goes to the issue today of reparations and what this would mean. But I'm wondering, the two of you, as Black reporters looking at the life and death of this Black man - again, we all knew immediately about George Floyd's death; we did not know about his life. Talk about taking on this project, investigating George Floyd, and what you identified with and what you didn't, the different paths you all took.\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : Well, Amy, I'll tell you, this is the most important and consequential thing I've done as a journalist. And Tolu and I, you know, we have, combined, 30 years of reportorial experience. And the reason I thought it was important is that I learned over the course of doing this writing and reporting that the idea of systemic racism - I used to think of it as a dark cloud that just hung over us, a stain in the fabric of America. But it's something far more terrifying. When I was with these families and these people watching the trial of Derek Chauvin, not knowing how it would turn out, it started to feel like a force, a pernicious force, that was threatening everybody - Black, white.\n\nAnd we thought by digging into the story of Floyd's family, learning about George Floyd, who was a striver despite his own mistakes and despite having an American society that always looked on him as a threat - often looked on him as a threat - he still believed in the promise of this country. And we wanted to be able to show readers about the cards that are stacked against people like George Floyd. And, you know, it was a personal thing, because people saw us, and they saw two Black men carrying the story. But because we are two Black men, we understood a lot of the things that they were talking about, emotionally. What we wanted to - what we hoped for is that people would understand not just the emotions but the history and be moved to move and think about these ideas in different ways.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tolu, you have George Floyd's family - he is named for his father, George Floyd - moving from North Carolina to Houston. And then you show the systemic, the institutional, the structural racism of what he enters when his family - when he ultimately grows up in Cuney Homes, the largest housing project, and, you know, overwhelmingly African American, in Houston. If you can lay that out for us? And I can't help but think, as I was reading your book this weekend, how many school districts might ban this book because you're directly addressing structural racism in this country.\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : Yeah. We are journalists, and we wanted to tell the full story, including the story of structural racism, which was a part of George Floyd's life, inarguably. It was clear that Floyd moved into a housing project that had been created specifically to house Black people during the late 1930s. It was during the time of segregation that this housing project was created. And it was allowed to fall into disrepair in part because its residents were 99% Black. And over those four decades before George Floyd moved there, that housing project became this sand trap of poverty, where most of the people living there were below the poverty line, where the government had essentially given up on this large housing project, and it was riddled with crime and all kinds of problems that made it a place that was hard to inhabit. It was a place that was hard for George Floyd and his family to live and have a normal lifestyle and have a normal childhood. And when you're growing up in that kind of community where you feel that government neglect, it's hard for you to have ambitions and to have dreams.\n\nNow, George Floyd did still have dreams as an 8-year-old. And we spoke to his second grade teacher. We knew that he wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. We knew that he was meeting all of his national benchmarks on reading and writing and math, despite his impoverished background, despite the fact that most of his peers were falling behind. He was someone who was able to catch up and, at least for a brief period, was able to show that he had that potential. Now, when you continue to live in that kind of community, when you continue to go to underfunded, segregated schools, it's going to be hard for you to continue to maintain grade level. And that's what happened to George Floyd, especially as he got taller and as he got bigger. People looked at him and said, \"This school thing is not going to quite work for you, because the schools that you're in are not well funded. They don't have the resources to get you out of here. But you have a body that can get you out of this community. It can take you to great wealth, if you condition that body and if you work on sports, if you go to the football field.\" And that's the story that he was told. That's what, as a child, he bought into, and he did focus on sports.\n\nAnd there was a time where it looked like he was on his way to great sports stardom. But, unfortunately, because his education wasn't strong enough, he wasn't able to capitalize on his body, and he wasn't able to capitalize on his athleticism. And he found himself going back to the Cuney Homes housing project, where he didn't have a college degree, he didn't have any income, he didn't have a job. And then, the next thing waiting for him was the criminal justice system, which was tailored to target people like him, who look like him, who came from the backgrounds that he came from. And lo and behold, he ended up cycling through that system for much of his life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, even as a young person, though he was extremely tall, he actually tried to compensate, you write, for looking in any way ominous, and that took away from him being an effective athlete, you know, as an aggressive football player. They felt he wasn't aggressive enough. He was always trying to reassure people that he was not threatening, Tolu.\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : Yeah. He would walk into a room and shake everyone by the hand and look everyone in the eye. And he told his brother - because his brother asked, \"Why do you always do that? Why do you go into a room like that?\" And he said, \"I can't go into a room the way you do, because people will be intimidated because of my size. I have to put them at ease.\" That's why he went around saying, \"I love you,\" in part, because he wanted to make sure people felt comfortable around him.\n\nAnd yes, on the football field, he was a jokester, and he was somebody who coaches tried to toughen up, because they realized that he was big, but he didn't have this aggressive, domineering personality, wasn't the kind of person that would try to exploit others because they were smaller.\n\nAnd so, that was always part of his personality. And that's why it was so tragic, in some ways, for the people who knew him, to know that the police officers that killed him saw him as this big, intimidating force, this person that was going to show excited delirium, that was going to rise up from the ground and start menacing them and menacing other people in the public. That wasn't his nature. And even while he was being arrested, he said, \"I'm not that kind of guy.\" And part of that was because he knew his body put forward a certain stereotype, and he wanted the police officers to know he was not the kind of guy that they stereotyped him as.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to Philonise Floyd, his brother, named for his father - they shared the same mother - when he was joining protests to demand justice and calling on lawmakers to take action. This was less than a month after his brother's murder, and Philonise traveled to Washington, D.C., to address the House Judiciary Committee in person.\n\nPHILONISE FLOYD : George always made sacrifices for our family, and he made sacrifices for complete strangers. He gave the little that he had to help others. He was our gentle giant. I was reminded of that when I watched the video of his murder. He called all the officers \"sir.\" He was mild-mannered. He didn't fight back. He listened to all the officers. The man who took his life, who suffocated him for eight minutes and 46 seconds, he still called him \"sir,\" as he begged for his life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Perry - that's George Floyd's brother Philonise testifying before Congress. If you can talk about his encounter with the criminal justice system? You also, through it, tell the story of private prisons, as well, being held at Hutto. Many in Texas know the Hutto prison. And actually, Hutto was named for the man who would found - am I right? - the Corrections Corporation of America, CCA ?\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : Yeah. I can jump in there, as well. We wanted to show how these systems operate. It's not happening in a vacuum, that millions of men, including hundreds of thousands of men that look like George Floyd, were swept into the criminal justice system. There was also a profit motive for some of the for-profit prisons that benefited from the mass incarceration system. They benefited from the idea that you would lock up as many people as possible, spend as little as possible doing so, and there's a profit that can be made there. And it goes back to the history of convict leasing. It goes back to the history of slavery. And we draw that link between what was happening in the 1800s and what is happening in the 20th and the 21st century.\n\nAnd George Floyd got caught up in that. And even as he agonized over his mistakes, and he talked about feeling sorry for the decisions that he made, that some of them led him to having a criminal record, he also felt that he didn't get a fair shake. He had to plead guilty in all of his cases. He never faced a jury of his peers, because he couldn't afford a lawyer, and he felt that, looking the way he did, he would never get a fair shot at trial. So he always plead guilty, even when, in some cases, he told his friends, \"I didn't do this.\" And some of the police officers that charged him were later charged with falsifying arrest on lots of people and charged with falsifying the arrest of George Floyd himself. So, he was caught up in that system, and there were people making money off of that system. And America decided to continue to enforce that system as our incarceration rate shot up to becoming the highest in the world by far, and millions of people ended up being locked up behind bars, including several for nonviolent drug crimes, in a scheme that we are just now trying to unravel.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, we're talking to Tolu Olorunnipa and Robert Samuels, the co-authors of His Name Is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice , on this second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which takes us to Robert. From Houston to Minneapolis, he goes. He had been arrested for and imprisoned for selling drugs. He also used drugs. And it was this cycle of drug use that he was constantly trying to break, that his family was trying to get him to break. He would also try to break the drug use of members of his family. Take us to Minneapolis and what he hoped for, going there not to sell drugs, not to take drugs, but to try to start life again.\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : Right. Well, George Floyd, when he was in Houston and when he was incarcerated in Texas, they had moved from thinking about having safe beds to help rehabilitate folks with drug dependency. And when he comes out of prison, he's looking for a job. He can't get one because of his record. You can't have something - you can't even have many professional licenses. You can't become a barber in Texas at the time if you had a felony. And also he had no health insurance, because Texas had decided not to expand insurance after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo, George Floyd, he becomes a part of a group of men, who are led by a pastor, who try to rehabilitate themselves, who try to find a way to get clean. And the pastor tells him that if you want this for yourself and your family, there is a place in Minnesota. And so he goes to a center, a rehabilitation center, to be able to get his life back into order. And when he comes out, he is clean. He's sober. He's working. He's working two jobs. He finds a house in a nice part, in a suburb near - overlooking sparkling waters. And things are going pretty well for him.\n\nBut one of the things, Amy, is that there are things that, as a Black man living in America, you can't escape. And the residue of that racism that you had lived with all your life continues to haunt you. And so, one of the things that happens in Minneapolis is his roommate, who was in rehab with him, he dies of a drug overdose, which puts George Floyd in a dark place. And we go through the minutiae of that in the book. But he's in a system where if you're white and you are living in a suburb, there was a lot of interest in helping to rehabilitate you. The federal government put billions of dollars into treatment and education and research about the opioid crisis when it hit white suburban communities. But if you're Black - and the state health department acknowledged it - they completely missed the alarming rise of use of opioids within Black communities, to the point where they started - the rates started becoming higher than whites. And a part of that has to do with the way we were thinking about drugs at the time. It is true that when they passed the crime bill in the 1990s, there was money dedicated to research and funding and education for Black communities. But when we looked at the records and when we went through the registrar, that money was never sent from the federal government.\n\nAnd so, he was living in a world where he was trying to get better, but there weren't a lot of supports to do it. And as we know, through everything that we've seen, the actual physiology of how a person responds to a substance use addiction does not change, whether you're Black or white in this country. What changes is how a person is treated. And that's what happened with George Floyd.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Robert, you do some really interesting investigation into cortisol. People might be, like, shaking their heads: \"What are you talking about?\" Explain.\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : Yeah. So, in the early '70s, there was a lot of effort put into thinking about something called \"high stress coping,\" right? And it was about, maybe if you're working too hard in the middle class, something bad might happen to you. You might get a heart attack. And there was a small group of public health researchers that started positing the questions about the Black body and what stress does to them. And it turns out that no matter your educational status, your socioeconomic status, your income, where you grew up, if you look at stress hormones in Black people - those are things like cortisol, that's the stuff that triggers the fight-or-flight response - those rates, those stress hormones are at elevated rates.\n\nSo, if your stress hormones are elevated for a little bit, it's not that bad of a thing. It can help you pass a test. It can help you do a feat of strength when you need it. But if they remain high, that raises inflammation in the body. So, that means you're more susceptible to things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure - two of the three things that George Floyd had.\n\nAnd the conclusion is that the stress of racism in this country, and in others, can make you sick. And that stress comes with feeling from discrimination, fearing microaggressions, feeling you have to work twice as hard to get by as a white man - you have to work twice as hard - and also the fear for your life, the fear that you might encounter one of the wrong police officers who might kill you one day. Racism can make us sick.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Which is exactly what happened to George Floyd. I mean, if you go through the men who were killed by police in Minneapolis before Perry, before George Floyd, he was very aware of this and affected by it. One of the things in this book that's so enraging is the record of Chauvin. I mean, this doesn't take responsibility from all over the country and police violence, but that, over and over again, he abused people and was never called on it. Explain that record. And I should say we have about five minutes left in this interview, and I really want to get to so many issues here. But the pervasive racism that had to underlie the Minneapolis Police Department for him to have gone after so many people, almost in the same way as he went after George Floyd, and not be called on it.\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then train people.\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : Yeah, yeah. Well, one thing I have to say is, Derek Chauvin's record as a police officer was not unusual for that precinct in the amount of complaints he got, which is a part of the issue, right? The second thing is that Derek Chauvin himself had a track record of aggressive behavior, that there were complaints. There is no public documentation that anything ever happened with those complaints, including several usages of the neck restraint, suffocating someone. That went on. He had started using that restraint - the first instance we know happens about 18 days after he was trained for it. George Floyd was the ninth person he used that technique on. Now, the interesting thing is, as Derek Chauvin continues to use this technique, it becomes more aggressive. And there's no record that anyone ever course-corrected him. And it became more aggressive until he actually killed a man. So, one thing that we say is systemic racism corrupts us all. And it has an impact on Black people. It also has an impact on white lives, as well. Derek Chauvin was in a system that made it seem like it might be OK to do this to somebody.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You spoke to, well, now-Governor Tim Walz, who warned you the momentum to make legislative changes to reduce racial inequality might have expired. As we hit this second anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, Robert Samuels, what is your sense?\n\nROBERT SAMUELS : The sense is that if you are a person of color in this country - and we talk about this in the last chapter, where Tim Walz makes that comment - you cannot believe that the future is so bleak, because that would be too bleak. It could cost you your life. And so, we've seen some small - we've seen some changes on the legislative level, at the state and local level. And now we're seeing a backlash to it. Books that people were saying everyone should read in 2020 are now the books that are being banned in 2022. And when we talked with the Reverend Jesse Jackson about this, he said to us, \"You have to consider the course of history. You have to look at the fact that progress comes in fits and starts, but people keep on moving. And we are moving toward a better place.\"\n\nWe hope that with this book, once people can realize the context of George Floyd's life and also remember why so many people took to the streets in the name of a better tomorrow, that they might also start thinking about systemic racism and how people can see folks in a fullness that George - with a fullness and a grace that George Floyd never seemed to fully get.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tolu, as we begin to wrap up this interview, you are a Nigerian American journalist, the first reporter of native African and Nigerian descent to cover the White House. You've said you felt convicted by Floyd's story. Explain what you mean, as we wrap up.\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : Yeah, there is a common saying among people of faith: \"There but for the grace of God go I.\" And that was a refrain that was in my head as I read this story, as I learned about George Floyd, as I wrote this book, in part because I knew that I had received a number of lucky breaks in life that allowed me to have a different pathway than George Floyd. And it was clear that it was important to write this story with empathy, because any of us can experience hardship in life, any of us can experience structural barriers in life; it's very uncommon for anyone who might be watching this to have experienced the number of hardships and structural barriers that George Floyd did, in part because that's the way systemic racism works. It operates in the background. It operates behind the scenes. And we wanted to shine a light on those systemic barriers. Even for people who have had better experiences in this country, it's important for us not to leave behind the millions of other George Floyds that are operating in silence, not getting the same attention, and who are experiencing some of the same struggles and troubles that he did during his life. And I know that, as a Black reporter, it's important for me to shine a light on those experiences, to make sure that people's voices are being heard, people's experiences are being seen. And George Floyd's experience is one that we hope will get people to understand that we have a lot of work to do as a country. And one of the first things we can do is acknowledge our history, acknowledge our systemic barriers, and see what we can do about fixing and changing a number of them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Did you feel more or less hopeful when you finished your book, Tolu?\n\nTOLUSE OLORUNNIPA : I have no choice but to feel more hopeful. That's the story of the Black American experience over the last 400 years. Hope is something that Black Americans have had to have. We've had a number of different times where we could have given up on this country. And if Black Americans were ever going to give up, we've had plenty of reasons to do so. But I think that hope -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have to leave it there, but I want to thank you so much to both of you, Tolu Olorunnipa and Robert Samuels.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe're continuing to look at the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd last May by kneeling on his neck for over nine minutes - 9:29 to be exact, nine minutes and 29 seconds. The trial began Monday.\n\nWe go now to Minneapolis, where we're joined by Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis-based civil rights attorney, activist and executive director of Wayfinder Foundation. She previously served as president of the Minneapolis NAACP . Her new article for BET is headlined \"A Guilty Verdict for Derek Chauvin Is the Only Justice Acceptable for George Floyd.\"\n\nNekima Levy Armstrong, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Thanks for having me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You bridge the attorney-activist divide. You're so often out in the streets, but also paying such serious attention to the day's opening arguments. Can you start off by responding to both the prosecution's case - one of the things they did was play the entire 9:29, nine minutes and 29 seconds, of Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of George Floyd, without comment, the 9:29, and then went on to their opening arguments. Your response?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : I thought that the prosecution team did a really great job of laying out the scene of what actually happened that day, as well as showing that gruesome bystander video. It was very difficult to watch. I'm sure that it had an impact on the jurors, hearing the voice of George Floyd, over and over again, nearly 30 times, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" calling for his mom, saying that his stomach hurt. So, I'm glad that they had such an impact in the beginning. And I also think that they laid out their theory of the case. They're going to talk about how the actions of Derek Chauvin played the most critical role in cutting off the air supply of George Floyd and causing cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\nIn terms of the defense strategy, I was really dismayed to see them try to deflect blame to bystanders and to blame George Floyd himself for his own death by talking about George Floyd having fentanyl in his system, and meth, and the fact that defense alleges that he resisted arrest and that that is what led to him ultimately dying on May 25th of 2020.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Nekima Levy Armstrong, what about the stance of the prosecutor that this trial was about Derek Chauvin rather than the police force at large? Your response to that line?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Of course, I'm very troubled by that line. Minneapolis police have a long history of engaging in excessive force, and even being allowed to murder people with impunity. Their reputation is very well known, particularly amongst Black people and other people of color within the city of Minneapolis. And it's well documented. Our City Council has settled tens of millions of dollars in excessive force lawsuits over the years because of the wayward conduct of MPD . So, from my vantage point, they are just as much on trial as Derek Chauvin, and hopefully those other three officers who aided and abetted him.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, the second witness that was called at the opening day of the trial was Alisha Oyler. At the time of Floyd's death, she was working as a cashier at the nearby Speedway. What's the importance, from your perspective, of her testimony?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Well, the Speedway is directly across the street from Cup Foods. It's not operable anymore, since George Floyd Square has become a place for people to gather and pay their respects to George Floyd and other stolen lives. I think the significance of her testimony was the fact that she was present, that she documented what happened through, I believe, seven videos, and she talked about the cops always, quote-unquote, \"messing with people,\" which shows that there is a track record of engaging people in a negative way, often for very little reason.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the role of the police union in Minneapolis, its impact on these cases, and whether it's used a double standard in the past in terms of relating to the race of officers involved?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Yes. Unfortunately, the Minneapolis Police Federation has been a very toxic organization. Typically, when police officers have killed people in the city of Minneapolis, now-former federation president Bob Kroll would go in front of the media and would essentially hail cops as heroes. He would say that their conduct was justified. And he would engage in the demonization of victims of police violence and police murder. Now Bob Kroll has since retired at the end of January, as a result of a lot of community pressure and pressure from activists. There is a new leader. It's unclear how they will respond as the trial unfolds. But in the early days after George Floyd was killed, Bob Kroll actually went in front of the media and tried to justify the conduct of those officers and engaged in demonizing George Floyd, talking about his past and things that really were not relevant to what happened on May 25th of 2020 that led to his death.\n\nNow, conversely, when Mohamed Noor, who was the Black Muslim Somali officer who killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond in July of 2017, the union was pretty silent with regards to supporting him. We didn't see the press conferences and the justifications for Mohamed Noor's actions as we had seen in previous cases in which officers were being blamed for killing someone. So there's a definite double standard at play. And I do believe that race matters with regard to how the federation responds in these situations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go back to prosecutor Jerry Blackwell addressing the jury on Monday.\n\nJERRY BLACKWELL : So, ultimately, ladies and gentlemen, what was this all about in the first place? Well, you're going to learn that it was about a counterfeit $20 bill used at a convenience store. That's all. You will not hear any evidence that Mr. Floyd knew that it was fake or did it on purpose. You will learn, from witnesses we will call, that the police officers could have written him a ticket and let the courts sort it out. You will learn that even if he did it on purpose, it was a minor offense, a misdemeanor.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is more of prosecutor Jerry Blackwell.\n\nJERRY BLACKWELL : You're also going to hear and see certain evidence of what this was not. This was, for example, not a fatal heart event. This was not, for example, a heart attack. You will learn that there was no demonstrated injury whatsoever to Mr. Floyd's heart, as in a heart attack. ... You will also learn, ladies and gentlemen, that George Floyd struggled with an opioid addiction. He struggled with it for years. You will learn that he did not die from a drug overdose. He did not die from an opioid overdose. ... We're going to ask, at the end of this case, that you find Mr. Chauvin guilty for his excessive use of force against George Floyd, that was an assault, that contributed to taking his life, and for engaging in eminently dangerous behavior, putting the knee on the neck, the knee on the back, for nine minutes and 29 seconds, without regard for Mr. Floyd's life. We're going to ask that you find him guilty of murder in the second degree, murder in the third degree and second-degree manslaughter. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, there you have the special prosecutor, Jerry Blackwell, making his opening arguments. Nekima Levy Armstrong, if you can go even further into this issue of trying to say that George Floyd did not die as the result of what one of the witness called - the mixed martial artist, Williams - a \"blood hold.\" I mean, that is so chilling and so striking, the \"blood choke.\" And he said that Chauvin looked in his eyes. The only time he acknowledged it - he acknowledged this bystander was when he used that term, as if he knew that term, as well. And yet, the defense trying to argue he had other reasons - you know, the issue of opioid addiction or fentanyl in his system - for him to have died on that night.\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Well, we all know, everyone who watched that gruesome video, that were it not for his encounter, George Floyd's encounter, with Derek Chauvin, he would still be alive today, regardless of what he had in his system. And that's what Jerry Blackwell tried to make clear, that, you know, his level of tolerance for opioids had increased as a result of struggling with these drugs for many years, and, again, the blame lies squarely with Derek Chauvin for using an excessive amount of force, in a situation that shouldn't have even been responded to with a 911 call. I mean, who calls 911 for a situation like that and expects to see, not one, not two, not three, not four, but five officers come onto the scene for that type of situation? It's absolutely absurd, but it's also par for the course in terms of Minneapolis police.\n\nNow, I am very glad that Donald Williams happened to be there that day, because of his 10 years of working in security, his extensive years of training as a mixed martial artist and his ability to recognize that Derek Chauvin was in fact doing a blood choke on George Floyd. And we saw in the video where, as the crowd grew increasingly more agitated, as they called out to Chauvin and the other cops to stop what they were doing, that Derek Chauvin lightly began to bounce on George Floyd's neck, sealing the deal, you know, ultimately causing his death as a result of his actions. And again, before the start of the trial, most people believe that this happened for eight minutes and 46 seconds. But we learned yesterday that it was even worse than that: nine minutes and 29 seconds of Derek Chauvin's knee on George Floyd's neck.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, The New York Times previously reported that Derek Chauvin was the subject of at least 22 complaints and internal investigations about his interactions with civilians. One of them led to two letters of reprimand, according to the report. What do you expect - including one situation where an African American woman said that Chauvin kept his knee on her body while she was being handcuffed face down on the ground. What do you expect to happen with these prior cases in terms of presentation in the trial? And also, the efforts by police unions always to prevent the records of police officers, their complaints against them, from being publicly known?\n\nNEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG : Well, prior to the start of the trial, prosecutors wanted the majority of those previous complaints and incidences against Derek Chauvin to be let in as evidence, and the judge has limited the scope of what can come in. So, that incident that you reference in The New York Times that happened to a Black woman who faced a similar circumstance as a result of an encounter with Derek Chauvin, that will be allowed in. There might be a few others, as well. And I do believe that the jury will take note of Chauvin's conduct in terms of using excessive force, but also being able to exercise restraint, as well, in certain circumstances.\n\nNow, the defense, of course, will argue that Derek Chauvin learned the technique that he used on George Floyd from his 19 years as a police officer, from the training. But one thing that will be interesting about this trial is the fact that the police chief himself, Medaria Arradondo, is planning to testify on behalf of the prosecution, saying that the Minneapolis Police Department offers no such training to police officers and that Derek Chauvin was not acting within the scope of what he learned during his 19 years on the force.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we're going to continue to cover this, of course. And then there is also the trial of the other officers, Thomas Lane, Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, who are charged each with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\n\nAs the COVID courtroom is set up inside - you know, when Blackwell is speaking, he's got plexiglass on three sides of him. When the judge talks to the lawyers, they don't come up for a sidebar. He's speaking through a kind of IFB , a little microphone into their ears, as they continue to sit there. And it's extremely limited, who can be in the courtroom. So, we'll be continuing to cover this through these weeks, if that is what it takes.\n\nI want to thank you, Nekima Levy Armstrong, Minneapolis-based civil rights attorney, activist and executive director of Wayfinder Foundation. Nekima Levy Armstrong previously served as president of the Minneapolis NAACP , and a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. And we'll link to your piece at BET , \"A Guilty Verdict for Derek Chauvin Is the Only Justice Acceptable for George Floyd.\"\n\nWhen we come back, we speak to the Salvadoran American journalist Roberto Lovato about how decades of U.S. military intervention in Central America is the crisis, rather than the migrants on the border.

Handcuffed and gasping for air, Floyd addressed the officer as '\"Sir.\" Floyd said \"I can't breathe\" more than 20 times. \"Mama, I love you,\" he cried. Minutes later, he died. Chauvin kept his knee in place for three more minutes, time during which George Floyd might have been resuscitated. Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, all it took to snuff out George Floyd's life of 46 years.\n\nThe twelve jurors unanimously found Chauvin guilty of 2nd degree murder, 3rd degree murder and manslaughter. It was the first time in Minnesota history that a white police officer had been convicted for killing an African American. George Floyd might be alive today, if any of the other three officers on the scene had intervened. Those three, Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, will soon face trials of their own for aiding and abetting Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nGeorge Floyd's case was referenced in a recent New York State Supreme Court decision. \"Quoting the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 'the time is always right to do right,'\" New York State Supreme Court Judge Dennis Ward wrote in his order, overturning the 2008 firing of Buffalo Police Officer Cariol Horne.\n\nIn 2006, Cariol Horne, an African American Police Officer in Buffalo, New York, responded to a call to assist another officer at an arrest in progress. What happened next turned her life upside down.\n\n\"I went to the home of Neal Mack at 707 Walden Avenue,\" Cariol Horne said this week on the Democracy Now! news hour. She saw an African American man being brutalized by another officer:  \"When I went inside of the house, Neal Mack was handcuffed and being punched in the face. So, once we got Neal Mack out of the house, that is when [Police Officer] Gregory Kwiatkowski started choking him. And that's when I released the chokehold, and then [Kwiatkowski] punched me in the face...So, then I went to the station house, reported it to the chief. An internal investigation started, and I became the target.\"\n\nAfter Horne grabbed Kwiatkowski's arm to stop him from choking Mack, Kwiatkowski punched Horne so hard that she needed reconstructive surgery. Despite that, after an internal investigation, it was Horne who was fired, not Kwiatkowski. She was just months away from being eligible for her full pension. The job loss as a mother of five, just as the global economic crisis hit, was catastrophic. She ended up homeless, living out of her car. Neal Mack credits Cariol Horne with saving his life. Years later, Kwiatkowski went to prison for beating four handcuffed teenagers.\n\nHorne organized a campaign to pass \"Cariol's Law\" in Buffalo, New York. The law codifies the duty to intervene for police officers, whether on- or off-duty, when they see another officer using unreasonable force against a civilian. It also protects those officers who intervene from retaliation. As the protests sparked by George Floyd's police killing swept the globe, the Buffalo City Council passed Cariol's Law, and the mayor signed it into law.\n\nThe Buffalo law also allowed officers who previously suffered retaliation to seek redress, which Cariol Horne did. She sued and won. Judge Dennis Ward's order restored her pension with back pay. Referring to George Floyd, Ward wrote, \"One of the issues in all of these cases is the role of other officers at the scene and particularly their complicity in failing to intervene to save the life of a person to whom such unreasonable physical force is being applied...To her credit, Officer Horne did not merely stand by, but instead sought to intervene, despite the penalty she ultimately paid for doing so,\" Judge Ward wrote in the order. \"While the Eric Garners and George Floyds of the world never had a chance for a 'do over', at least here the correction can be done.\"\n\nThe pace of police killings in the U.S., averaging about three per day, has not slowed since the protests erupted after George Floyd's death. Cariol Horne is pushing for \"Cariol's Law\" to be passed in cities and states across the country, as Congress debates the \"George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020,\" which would ban chokeholds and establish a duty to intervene for federal police, among other things.\n\nDerek Chauvin is going to prison for George Floyd's murder largely due to the actions and testimony of bystanders, from a nine-year-old girl to the teenager who recorded the crime. Let their courage inspire the national adoption of the duty of police to intervene, rather than aiding and abetting, police brutality.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Memorial events and marches are celebrating George Floyd's life and commemorate the first anniversary of his murder, and President Joe Biden is hosting some of his family at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over legislation that bears his name, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Monifa Bandele, who sits on the steering committee for Communities United for Police Reform and is an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, says the racial justice uprising that followed Floyd's death served as a \"clarion call\" to defund police and reinvest those resources. \"What you see emerging from the communities is a much more powerful demand to actually shift the realities so that our children are not marching again in another 50 years,\" Bandele says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, May 25th, 2020, members of his family are meeting President Joe Biden at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over legislation that bears his name, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. On Sunday, Floyd's family members spoke at a rally of hundreds in Minneapolis in front of the courthouse where, just a month ago, former policeman Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. This is George Floyd's sister Bridgett.\n\nBRIDGETT FLOYD : Tuesday will be a year. It has been a long year. It has been a painful year. It has been very frustrating for me and my family. For your life to change within a blink of an eye, I still don't know why.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Outrage over George Floyd's death sparked international protests and a national reckoning over race and policing.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Monifa Bandele, an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 150 Black-led advocacy groups.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Monifa. So, this is the first anniversary of the murder of George Floyd. Can you talk about what has changed in this year, your feelings at the time, and where we have come at this point around issues of policing, structural racism and police accountability?\n\nMONIFA BANDELE : This murder of George Floyd was happening during a continuum. As we know, these murders are going on constantly in our cities across the country in Black communities. And since the Ferguson uprising, our coalition had been calling for an invest-divest model. We said we actually need to divest from these institutions and systems that harm us, like incarceration, like policing, and actually invest resources into what we know keeps communities safe, like stable housing, healthcare, mental health assistance, education.\n\nAnd so, when we were in that moment of the uprising and the outrage around what had happened to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade, communities all over the country were reflecting on their own George Floyds. You know, here in New York, where I live, we're thinking about Eric Garner, who didn't get justice until the police officer was fired six years ago, and Ramarley Graham and so, so many families.\n\nSo, that mandate on the streets on May 25th, and then again on June 19th and throughout the country, you heard the clarion call to defund the police. And I'm glad that attorney Lee Merritt said earlier that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a step, because what you see emerging from the communities is a much more powerful demand to actually shift the reality so that our children are not marching again in another 50 years.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Monifa, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the George Floyd Act, what you see as positive in it and what could still be strengthened either at the federal level or at the state and local levels.\n\nMONIFA BANDELE : Yes, absolutely. I mean, when we look at a piece of federal legislation that we drafted, called the BREATHE Act, it contained some of the things that you see in the George Floyd Act. We talk about ending qualified immunity. We definitely talk about what attorney Merritt said about moving the bar from willfulness to recklessness, so that federal prosecutors can hold individual police officers accountable.\n\nBut what's not there is the greater accountability. We want more than just accountability for the individual police officer. There's accountability that needs to be held by entire police departments, by our cities, our states, our federal government. We talk about reparations for these systems and patterns and practices that have existed for so long.\n\nSo, we're very - we are flanking the family of George Floyd. They are so courageous and amazing leaders. But we are also coming in right behind that, saying that we want invest-divest. We want to defund these harmful policing systems, and we want to create something new.\n\nHow to strengthen it? They're fighting just to keep the compromise bill that's there. So, that's a question I don't know how to answer, because every day you turn on the news, it's being weakened as we speak.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you mentioned that you're speaking from New York. New York City obviously is facing a mayoral primary in June. And I'm wondering your sense of how the different candidates are dealing, who are running for the Democratic nomination - which is tantamount pretty much to winning the mayor's race in New York City - how they are dealing with the issue of police reform, which ones of them you think have a better grasp or are seeking to go in a better direction.\n\nMONIFA BANDELE : We've seen something amazing that lets us know that our efforts of fighting in the streets and in the city halls and in the statehouses is winning, because the conversation has changed. In every candidate's forum, you see police officers [ sic ] not only asked about individual cases and what they would do about, quote-unquote, \"bad apples,\" but now they're being asked those systems questions. They're asking where they stand on defund. They're asking - they're being asked, \"Why does New York have a six, with a B, billion dollars, with a B, budget for the NYPD ?\" And they are having to give new models, new ideas of how they're going to restructure this thing.\n\nNow, some are answering those questions very well, and some are avoiding them, but the conversation keeps coming up. And what we see, really, at the front right now are the two women of color are, I think, taking the lead in really examining and unpacking and listening to communities and our demands. It's very difficult, because the press and the media tries to spin defund as a liability. And we know that it's an asset, because if you sit and talk to people, I want my neighbors to be able to have access to mental healthcare. I would have loved Mohamed Bah's mom to be able to pick up the phone, and when she called 911, she got an ambulance with a mental health crisis expert, and not the police that killed her son. So, if they were to have those conversations, they would be on our side and know that defund is the path forward.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to Minneapolis Sunday, community members, civil rights leaders, George Floyd's family gathering to mark the first anniversary of his murder. This is the local community organizer and pastor Carmen Means.\n\nCARMEN MEANS : So, what has changed? The game hasn't changed. The game remains the same. But what has changed is that you've been activated on a whole 'nother level. There's a warrior on the inside of you that was activated on 5/25 on a whole 'nother level.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's take that national and stick with your analysis of what defund the police has meant all over the country. I mean, in Minneapolis, the entire City Council had voted to, in a sense, disband the police, though that is not happening. What it means in New York, the shifting of funds, and where you see it going in the future, and why you supported the BREATHE Act and helped craft it, over the George Floyd police accountability act?\n\nMONIFA BANDELE : My sister in Minneapolis is speaking truth. You know, what has changed is that 25 million people took to the streets, and we can't come back with 1990s or even early 2000s reforms - right? - banning chokeholds, these things that actually already exist in cities, where people then were then killed by a chokehold, like in the case here in New York City with Eric Garner. Chokeholds are banned here. People want more. And we have been activated to demand more. We don't want to see any more videos. You know, the Ronald Greene video is horrific. It shakes us to our core. And we refuse to let our children exist like this and our grandchildren. So, she is absolutely right.\n\nAnd so, even in a short amount of time, even though what happened in Minneapolis wasn't what the people who were dreaming big wanted, even though in New York we didn't get that $1 billion cut that we fought for just weeks after the George Floyd - after the uprisings here for our budget fight, all across the country $870 million has been cut from police departments in a year. So we're winning. We're gaining momentum. We're having the conversation. And it is because, like my sister said in Minneapolis, we are inspired, we're activated, we're not backing down. Today, people will see all over the country, just like here in Brooklyn at Barclays Center, people are mobilizing, and our mantra is that the call remains defund NYPD .\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how do you respond to those who say that the protests of the past year have basically helped to fuel increasing crime and gun violence across the country, with police officers now less likely to act boldly in terms of keeping crime down? Your response to those skeptics and critics?\n\nMONIFA BANDELE : Policing as an intervention is reactionary. You know, police come after something has already happened. We want more safety than that. We want the safety intervention that happens when the person needs care in the first place, before the violence happens, before the displacement happens.\n\nAnd so, our response to them is that all you have to do is actually look around the country and see that the communities that are the safest are not the communities that have the most police. So, then, what does that lead you to ask? You know, are the people in those communities just inherently less violent and, you know, more secure? No. There are other resources.\n\nSo it's not just about moving the money out of the police departments. It's also about standing up the systems, institutions that we need. Here in New York City, we have violence prevention programs that are community-based and -led, that must be scaled up. We need the mental health beds. We need the mental healthcare, immediately.\n\nAnd it's also a myth that the police budget was cut. You know, you also have this media spin, where the mayor, every time violence happens, and they're like, \"Oh, see, this is why we didn't defund\" - we didn't defund. We still have the largest police force in the country, and they are unable to control the violence that is emerging in my community of Bed-Stuy. So I want a different intervention. I want an intervention that works.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Monifa Bandele, we want to thank you for being with us, sits on the steering committee for Communities United for Police Reform and the Policy Table Leadership Team for the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nHappy Birthday, Mike DiFilippo! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, killing him with the excessive use of force in 2019. Floyd's dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for social justice protests and calls to defund the police across the country. Chauvin also pleaded guilty for violating the civil rights of a 14-year-old juvenile in 2017. \"To be held accountable on both levels, on state level and federal level, we believe, sends a very clear message that the deliberate indifference and the denial of constitutional rights of marginalized people of color won't be tolerated,\" says Benjamin Crump, attorney for multiple families of victims of police brutality.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show in Minnesota, where former police officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal charge of violating George Floyd's civil rights. Chauvin had previously pleaded not guilty but changed his plea after he was found guilty of Floyd's murder in a closely watched trial. This was the first time Chauvin publicly admitted to his role in Floyd's death.\n\nGeorge Floyd's family held a news conference following Chauvin's hearing. This is one of Floyd's brothers, Philonise Floyd, speaking outside the federal court in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nPHILONISE FLOYD : We just wanted accountability, because we can never have justice, because we can never get George back. ... We can never heal, but we can just be a big family that we always have been. We've always been together. The same thing we did with George, we still do it. Just like me, when I want to feel like I'm closer to George, I always eat me a banana mayonnaise sandwich, because that's something that we did together. And watching sports and different things and praying, I think about George all the time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As part of Derek Chauvin's plea deal, he'll also plead guilty to violating the civil rights of a Black 14-year-old during his 2017 arrest. Chauvin grabbed the teen by the throat, hit him repeatedly in the head with a flashlight and pressed his knee into the boy's neck while he was prone, handcuffed and not resisting. The teen, who's not been identified, was present in the courtroom Wednesday. According to the pool reporter inside court, Philonise Floyd turned to the teen after Chauvin's hearing and said, quote, \"It's a good day for justice.\"\n\nThis is George Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams speaking at the Floyd family news conference Wednesday.\n\nBRANDON WILLIAMS : We were in court with a minor who - he also pled guilty to charges of assaulting him. And after hearing the details of it, that guy is a monster. He should have been arrested in 2017 and had justice in it. Had he been held accountable for what he did in 2017 to that minor, George Floyd would still be here. ... He knew what he was doing. He had nine minutes and 29 seconds to understand what he was doing and stop kneeling. He chose not to.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Derek Chauvin is currently serving a 22-and-a-half-year prison sentence after being convicted on all three counts, including on intentional second-degree murder, for killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds in May 2020. Chauvin was the first white police officer in Minnesota to ever be convicted of killing a Black man.\n\nWell, for more, we're joined in Orlando, Florida, by civil rights attorney Ben Crump. He's part of George Floyd's family's legal team.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Ben Crump. Can you start off by talking about the significance of Chauvin changing his plea to guilty and what this means for him?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : It's very significant. In fact, everything about the tragic killing of George Floyd and the aftermath as we pursue equal justice in America is historic. The fact that you have a white police officer not only being convicted on the state level for killing a Black man in America, but now you have that officer being convicted based on his plea of guilty on the federal level, it is very landmark as we think about the history of police excessive force on Black people in America. Rarely are they held accountable at all. But to be held accountable on both levels, on state level and federal level, we believe, sends a very clear message that the deliberate indifference and the denial of constitutional rights of marginalized people of color won't be tolerated. And it is very important that, in George Floyd's case, this tragedy that was seen by millions upon millions of people all around the world, that the message for our children, for our young people, is that this is unacceptable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the 17-year-old and how - can you talk about the 17-year-old and how significant it is that if Derek Chauvin had been brought up on charges in 2017, that, as his nephew pointed out, George Floyd would be alive today? What happened to the teenager?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : Well, absolutely. This teenager, this 17-year-old Black teenager, was brutalized very similar to George Floyd. This whole notion of putting a knee on the back of a person, on the neck of a person who is not resisting, it is something that we believe the Minneapolis Police Department, and especially union leaders, had condoned. This idea of \"killology\" is the term they use, Amy, and it was to brutalize people and, in fact, to take control of a person, even if that meant killing them for unjustifiable reasons. It was a culture. It was a mentality. And had they dealt with this with the 17-year-old unidentified Black teenager in 2017, as Brandon Williams, George Floyd's nephew, said, this police officer who was without morals, without ethics, would have never put his knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, because he would have already been held accountable for doing a similar act to a 17-year-old kid. And maybe that's why he was so cool and collected while he sat there with his knee on George Floyd's neck and his hand in his pocket, because he knew, based on what happened in 2017, nothing was going to happen. And so he had no care about George Floyd's pleas, saying \"I can't breathe\" 28 times.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what about the other three officers? When are they being tried?\n\nBENJAMIN CRUMP : It is scheduled in late January for their trials to commence. We believe that the plea of Derek Chauvin and the detail, the great detail, that he admitted to in his plea is going to help make sure there's accountability for those three officers' role in killing of George Floyd.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "One year on, how George Floyd's murder has changed the world\n\nThe killing of Floyd by a white officer reflected a common history of violence against Black people that united protesters in a renewed global movement\n\nGeorge Floyd's murder felt like everything was the same and nothing was the same, said Miski Noor, an activist in Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed by a white police officer a year ago on 25 May.\n\n\"How many times have we seen Black death go viral?\" asked Noor, the co-founder of Black Visions, which advocates for abolition, an approach to public safety that does not involve the police.\n\nNoor, who helped found the group in 2017, knows that to abolish policing you also must confront systemic racism and the weight of history. And Noor also knows as the child of Somali immigrants, that the issues are global.\n\nThe high-profile murder of Floyd, who was pinned under the knee of a police officer for nine minutes and 29 seconds , captured the parallels between police violence against Black people across the globe, and evoked the deaths of Adama Traoré in France and Mark Duggan in the UK before him, even though the circumstances of the deaths differ. And the execution reflected a common history of violence against Black people, from slavery to colonialism, that united protesters in a renewed global movement against the legacy of empire and its enduring racist symbols.\n\nSince his death, those public images have rapidly come down - from the toppling of a statue honoring the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, England, to the official removal of the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis's statue from the Kentucky state capitol.\n\nMore statues honoring the Confederacy, the band of southern states that fought against the US government in the civil war, have been taken down in the past year than in the previous four years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Since Floyd's death, nearly 170 statues, street names and other tributes to the Confederacy have been removed or renamed in the US, SPLC data shows. More than 2,100 tributes to the Confederacy remain in public places; over 700 are monuments.\n\nThis reclaiming of public history isn't new, but Floyd's death was the latest catalyst, said historian Robin DG Kelley. \"There has been a continuous reckoning around public history and race,\" said Kelley, Gary B Nash endowed chair in UShistory at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"And it wasn't his death but the presence of 26 million [protesters] and the fear it generated that compelled institutions to act.\"\n\nDemands to remove monuments, change names and decolonize history were a part of the US culture wars of the 1990s, which included defending ethnic studies at universities. More recently, the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, the successful 2015 student movement in South Africa to remove a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes from the University of Cape Town, has inspired similar action in the UK and other countries.\n\nNoor, who uses the pronoun \"they\", said they were taught a whitewashed version of US history through the perspective of white, cisgendered men, while growing up in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\"To sell so many untruths, so many lies as factual, you have to actually erase. You have to omit whole lived histories,\" said Noor, who delved deeply into African and African American history for the first time while attending the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.\n\nHistorian Nell Irvin Painter, who addresses Confederate iconography in an ink, graphite and collage series called From Slavery to Freedom , said many people weren't ready to reckon with the symbols until Floyd's death.\n\n\"When the big public got ready around 2020, all this came to the fore,\" said Painter, author of The History of White People. \"[Floyd's] murder was so egregious that you just couldn't pretend it didn't happen. Like with civil rights, there's a long history that most people hadn't known about ... that could only be seen by lots of people at the right historical time.\"\n\nThat was also true in the UK.\n\nIn what historians describe as an \"unprecedented\" public reckoning with the British empire, an estimated 39 names - including streets, buildings and schools - and 30 statues, plaques and other memorials have been or are undergoing changes or removal since last summer's Black Lives Matter protests in the UK.\n\n\"The death of George Floyd sparked an exploration for me on how this country deals with racism. It was a big awakening,\" said Tyrek Morris, a university student in Manchester.\n\nMorris, who organized his first protest following Floyd's death, said wherever he turned, he saw placards with an enduring slogan: \"The UK is not innocent.\"\n\nThe message reverberated deeply within him and started him on a journey where he interrogated what he was taught and, more importantly, what he wasn't. At these Black Lives Matter protests, Morris heard from the family of Mark Duggan, whose death at the hands of the police sparked the 2011 London riots ; of Shukri Abdi and Christopher Kapessa, two children who drowned, but whose families say authorities failed to take their cases seriously; of the crimes of the British empire and a frank assessment of Britain's role in the slave trade.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 people marched with Morris, who organised with the group All Black Lives UK (ABLUK), in Manchester on 6 June, one of 160 protests that weekend. ABLUK also organized a gathering of 10,000 demonstrators in Bristol, where they toppled a statue of the 17th-century slave trader Colston. Xahra Saleem, a writer who runs a small jewellery business, clearly remembers the moment the Colston statue was taken down. She was one of the organisers of the protest and was walking ahead of the march. She passed the statue and joked to a friend: \"Wouldn't it be crazy if it fell down at some point?\" Then it did. \"It was like we manifested it,\" she said.\n\nA decades-long campaign by the local community to get the statue removed had been ignored by the local authority. But once the statue fell, everything changed.\n\n\"Schools changed their names and roads' names changed. Everything happened so quickly. Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of a push,\" Saleem said.\n\nIn France , the only country that outlawed slavery and later reinstated it, outrage over Floyd's death quickly revived a tense debate about the weight of colonial history and the country's slave-trading past. Starting in French Caribbean islands, statues were pulled down or defaced by protesters. In Martinique, a long-simmering controversy over white figures on plinths boiled over: statues of the white politician Victor Schœlcher, who facilitated the decree to abolish slavery, were targeted amid calls for more visibility for the rebellions by enslaved people, which led to abolition.\n\n\"George Floyd's death opened up a lot of debate on race in France - around questions of white privilege, police violence and racism in the police as well as France's colonial past,\" said Rokhaya Diallo, a writer, broadcaster and anti-racism campaigner.\n\n\"But there was also a lot of resistance and denial of the problem, particularly in TV studio debates,\" Diallo said. \"There will always be some denial, but what has changed is that we can no longer ignore the issue. The lid can't be put back on, particularly for young people today.\"\n\nFrance was the first country to officially recognise slavery as a \"crime against humanity\" - enshrined in a 2001 law which set out to improve the teaching of slavery and the colonial era. But historians have raised concerns that teaching in French schools is still too little.\n\n\"The Napoleon commemorations in France this May showed that this is still a debate,\" Diallo said of the bicentennial observance of the emperor's death.\n\nThough he has promised to be \"uncompromising in the face of racism, antisemitism and discrimination\", President Emmanuel Macron has insisted that France would not take down statues of controversial, colonial-era figures.\n\nThe response to Floyd's death \"already had an international dimension\", historian Kelley said. \"It wasn't simply sympathy for another African American victim. It was recognition that this kind of violence was happening all over the world.\"\n\nFloyd's case was eerily like that of Adama Traoré, a 24-year-old Black man, who died after being stopped by gendarmes outside Paris in 2016. Pinned to the ground, he told officers: \"I can't breathe,\" just as Floyd did. Investigating judges are examining conflicting medical reports in his case.\n\nAssa Traoré said her brother initially ran from police because he didn't have his identity card with him, an extension of life there. A Black or North African man in France is 20 times more likely to be stopped for an identity check than a white man, research shows. And those controls can end in violence or death.\n\nBlack people enslaved by he French had to carry official documents, according to Traoré, who said the need for documentation \"links back to everything that is unsaid about colonial history and its consequences ... As long as the French police doesn't confront its past and say there is racism in the police, we won't get anywhere, it's a struggle that will never end.\n\n\"So yes,\" Traoré said, \"statues and street names are a start in a country facing up to the violence of its past.\"\n\nFor Bree Newsome Bass, who in 2015 removed the Confederate flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse, the whole story of America is in question, similar to the debates in France and the UK.\n\n\"We tend to think of ourselves as having broken free of colonialism, but what is lost is the history of genocide of the indigenous Americans. I've really come into recognizing what that means in terms of how we think of America, as this new nation as opposed to what it is, which is really a colony,\" said Newsome Bass, a film-maker and activist. \"It began as a slave colony, and even though we broke off from Britain, the United States evolved into its own white settler colonial state.\"\n\nSince Floyd's death, there is a new roll call of Black people in the US who have died at the hands of police, a painful reminder of what hasn't changed when the statues came down. While Derek Chauvin was convicted of killing Floyd, names like Rayshard Brooks and Daunte Wright join a growing list of lives lost, linked to steady demands for institutional change and greater accountability .\n\nKelley said events of the past year illustrate how easy it is to topple a statue or change the name of a building, and how difficult it is to topple an empire, dismantle racial capitalism and patriarchy, and replace prisons and jails with \"non-carceral, caring forms for public safety\".\n\nThe situation also creates a quandary, Kelley said. What do we make of universities that change building names but have huge real estate holdings in neighboring low-income communities or endowments with investments in private prisons or occupied Palestine? What do we make of Barclays Bank removing the name of enslaver Andrew Buchanan from its new Glasgow property, and yet it has its own sordid history with trading the enslaved ?\n\n\"[Removing symbols] makes us feel good, but it ironically has the effect of personalising and individualising racism,\" Kelley said. \"Some of the most important British abolitionists, for example, came from the ranks of industrial capitalists. Do they stay or fall?\"\n\nIn the UK, campaigners also fear that changes such as removing statues are cosmetic. Robert Beckford, a professor of Black theology at the Queen's Foundation, said: \"Presenting a more balanced view of the history is necessary, but I'm worried that removing the symbols, removing of a plaque is viewed as equivalent to anti-racist, institutional change.\"\n\nFor Morris, the work has only just begun. He points to the British government's controversial report on race , which claimed to not find evidence of institutional racism in the UK in the areas it studied, as a sign of how far the UK must go to confront its past and present. He believes the answer to that is more protests.\n\nSaleem, who organised the Colston protest, agrees. \"We're planning to make it a summer of anti-racist movements, activities and protests.\"\n\nThe work continues in Minneapolis, too. This summer, Black Visions plans to gather residents to answer the question: \"What will keep us safe?\" The goal is to have a mandate and collective definition of safety that is driven by Minneapolis residents and includes alternatives to current approaches to public safety.\n\nA coalition called Yes 4 Minneapolis submitted a petition to change the city charter, which requires the city to rely on police for public safety. The petition calls for a November ballot question to allow residents to replace police with a public safety department.\n\n\"I want to see more of my people and my ancestors reflected in the world that I live in,\" said Noor . \"But how about we just build that world instead of just changing the street signs in this one?\n\n\"It's Black folks continuing to fight for the basic right ... to live so we can thrive. George Floyd is a part of that story.\""

      "text": "The life of George Floyd: 'He knew how to make people feel better'\n\nHow someone beloved by family and many in the community became a man who would 'change the world'\n\nGeorge Floyd's loved ones said at his funeral on 9 June last year that his tragic killing at the hands of police was \"going to change the world\".\n\nBut who was George Floyd and why did his excruciating demise, out of so many thousands of police-involved deaths in the US, make his name one that, to quote his family again, \"everybody is going to remember\"?\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was living in Minneapolis when the police pinned him to the street during an arrest for an alleged misdemeanor on 25 May 2020, and Derek Chauvin, a white officer, kneeled on his neck for - a jury later heard - nine minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nBut he was born George Perry Floyd, Jr, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on 14 October 1973 and grew up in Houston, Texas, where he was eventually laid to rest, his six-year-old daughter talking in the days after his death about how much she would miss him .\n\nGrowing over 6ft tall as a teen and ultimately to 6ft 6in, and a popular, formidable athlete, he was best known in his Texas youth affectionately as a gentle giant and \"Big Floyd\", the tremendous football and basketball player, which he hoped would be a ticket out of his poor neighborhood.\n\nIt did not prove to be. Floyd was unable to escape the clutches of drug crime and ended up in prison, but after he was free again he campaigned against violence, mentoring young men and being mentored in many ways himself by other community leaders and his involvement with an outreach ministry.\n\nGetting good work was hard, however, and Floyd moved to Minneapolis with a friend in 2014 to start a new chapter . He worked at a variety of jobs and was doing security work at a Salvation Army shelter when he met Courteney Ross.\n\nShe became his girlfriend and gave heart-wrenching testimony at Derek Chauvin's murder trial about how she and Floyd slipped into opioid dependency after being prescribed painkillers, just two more people out of millions hit by America's opioids crisis .\n\nEvery day of the three weeks of opening arguments and testimony in Chauvin's trial, members of Floyd's family, usually one of his brothers and more often that not Philonise Floyd, occupied the single seat in the courtroom allocated to Floyd friends and relatives amid tight coronavirus restrictions.\n\nPhilonise was also allowed to address the court about his older brother's character.\n\nHe told the jury George Floyd \"was so much of a leader to us in the household\".\n\n\"He would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\" he recalled. \"He made sure that we all were going to be in school on time. He just was like a person that everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better.\"\n\nHe also said: \"He was a big mama's boy,\" describing Floyd's relationship with their mother.\n\nWhen she died in May 2018, Philonise recalled, \"He would just say 'Mama, Mama' over and over again.\n\nAnd it was what George Floyd cried out as he was dying under Chauvin's knee on that south Minneapolis street, having ultimately not been able to escape the legion consequences of growing up Black and poor in America and having to navigate the criminal justice system and the dangers of being confronted by the police.\n\nThose cries were caught on the bystander video that went viral, as well as Floyd's repeated pleas for mercy as he said he could not breathe and onlookers, including an elderly man and a nine-year-old child, begged the police to let up and \" get off of him \".\n\nThe stark video left no room for cover-up.\n\nAnd the graphic analogy expressed by many protesters and activists since then was that this was not just one more white police officer killing a Black man but the proverbial continuation of a white America that has been pressing its knee into the neck of Black America with impunity since 1619 ."

      "text": "George Floyd murder: Minneapolis police have pattern of aggression and discrimination, DoJ inquiry finds\n\nMerrick Garland announces findings of Department of Justice investigation into department after Floyd's killing by officers\n\nThe US attorney general, Merrick Garland, on Friday announced that the 2020 murder of George Floyd was part of a \"pattern or practice\" of excessive force used by the department and years of unlawful discrimination against Black Americans.\n\nGarland held a press conference to reveal the findings of the two-year investigation by the Department of Justice (DoJ) into the conduct and training of the Minneapolis police department (MPD) both before and after George Floyd 's death at the hands of officers in the city in 2020.\n\n\"We found that MPD in the city of Minneapolis engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, unlawfully discriminating against Black and Native American people in enforcement activities, violating the rights of people engaged in protected speech and discriminating against people with behavioral disabilities...when responding to them in crisis,\" Garland said at the event in Minneapolis on Friday morning.\n\nFloyd's murder sparked months of local, national and international protests and a fresh reckoning in the US on policy brutality and more general systemic racism in American society.\n\nThe demonstrations were the largest nationwide protests since the civil rights movement and, despite being largely peaceful and critical of violent policing, were at times themselves aggressively policed, in Minneapolis and elsewhere, leading to record payouts to injured civilians by US cities.\n\nOn Friday, Garland said: \"George Floyd should be alive today.\" He said his killing had an \"irrevocable impact on Minneapolis, the country and the world\".\n\nA Minnesota investigation led to the convictions of several police officers involved in his botched arrest and brutal killing. The Department of Justice opened the investigation after the 2021 conviction of Derek Chauvin , the most senior officer on the scene that night, who kneeled on Floyd's neck for almost 10 minutes as he begged to be allowed to breathe. Chauvin and his three fellow officers, who were all fired soon after the murder, were also convicted of federal hate crimes.\n\nGarland held a press conference in Minneapolis with the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, who was in office at the time of Floyd's murder on 25 May 2020, and the new police chief, Brian O'Hara.\n\nGarland said that the style of policing in the city violated the US constitution and announced that the justice department and the city of Minneapolis \"have agreed in principle to negotiate towards a consent decree\".\n\nThat is the sort of agreement federal prosecutors reach with cities to reform their police departments following investigations into how they interact with the community.\n\n\"We observed many MPD officers who did their difficult work with professionalism, courage and respect. But the patterns and practices we observed made what happened to George Floyd possible,\" Garland said. \"As one city leader told us, 'these systemic issues didn't just occur on May 25 2020 [when Floyd was murdered]. There were instances like that, that were being reported by the community long before that.'\"\n\nGarland said the department's conduct was \"deeply disturbing\" and eroded community trust.\n\n\"We found that the Minneapolis police department routinely uses excessive force, often when no force is necessary, including unjust, deadly force and unreasonable use of Tasers,\" the attorney general said. He related a 2017 incident in which a police officer fatally shot a woman, who an officer said \"'spooked him' when she approached his squad car. The woman had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in a nearby alley.\"\n\nGarland noted that the investigation found that Minneapolis police \"routinely disregard the safety of people in their custody\".\n\n\"Our review found numerous incidents in which MPD officers responded to a person's statement that they could not breathe with a version of 'you can breathe. You're talking right now.'\"\n\nMinneapolis has made some reforms to its policing but the federal government is demanding more.\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights, related more examples of unjustifiable force.\n\n\"We found that officers use deadly force without probable cause to believe that there was an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or another person,\" Clarke said. \"In one example, an off-duty officer fired his gun at a car containing six people within three seconds of getting out of his squad car.\"\n\nClarke continued by saying that the police use neck restraints, Tasers, pepper spray and bodily force without warning and in ways that is inconsistent with the law.\n\nThe justice department found that, during traffic stops, Minneapolis officers were six times more likely to use force against Black members of the public than against white people.\n\nFrey said: \"Today marks a new chapter in the history of public safety in Minneapolis ... We are not going to stop until every single person in every single neighborhood and zip code will feel safe interacting with the police.\"\n\nO'Hara thanked the justice department for its \"deep dive\" investigation.\n\n\"We acknowledge the pain, anger, frustration, fear and sense of vulnerability that many people in our community have endured,\" he said.\n\nThe US congresswoman Ilhan Omar welcomed oversight by the federal government.\n\n\"As a Black woman living in Minneapolis, I have experienced some of these violations first-hand,\" she said, adding: \"For years, we have been offered a false choice between public safety and accountability. We have been told that bending to the will of the police union and the MPD is the only way to reduce crime. But rampant abuse and racism, constitutional violations and killing of unarmed Black people does not make our community any safer.\"\n\nShe called for a police department following the \"highest standards of ethics and conduct\" and called on Congress to pass numerous pieces of legislation aimed at making policing safer, including the stalled reform bill, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n\nThe DoJ's report described numerous examples over several years of Minneapolis police flagrantly Tasering, pepper spraying, drawing guns and using \"bodily force\" on citizens, especially Black people, including children, who variously posed no public threat, were complying with police orders or were suspected of very minor offenses."

      "text": "Minnesota School District Bans Officer Who Reenacted George Floyd's Murder\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A Minnesota school district has banned a police officer from working as a substitute teacher after a series of \"racially harmful\" actions that officials say included putting a student on the ground for a reenactment of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer.\n\nThe staffing agency that placed him at Woodbury High School said Wednesday that he also no longer works for them.\n\nThe man was serving as a substitute English teacher on Monday when he told students in four separate 10th and 12th grade classes that they might want to hear about his life as a police officer, school officials said in a letter to students, families and staff.\n\nBesides the re-enactment of the actions that led to the death of George Floyd, students also complained that the substitute teacher \"repeatedly made racially harmful comments,\" \"told sexist jokes,\" \"spoke in disturbing detail about dead bodies he had seen,\" said \"cops would be the best criminals\" because \"they know how to get away with stuff,\" and \"stated that police brutality isn't real,\" the letter SAID.\n\nThe letter was signed by the principal of Woodbury High School and the superintendent and assistant superintendent of the South Washington County Schools district. It said the man is now prohibited from setting foot on district property. They also said they reported the incident to the Minnesota Department of Education, the state teacher licensing board and the Woodbury Police Department.\n\nFloyd died after a white officer pinned his neck to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes despite the Black man's dying pleas of \"I can't breathe.\" Children were among the concerned witnesses, including a teen who captured the incident on a video widely viewed on social media. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder. Floyd's death touched off protests that sometimes turned violent, testing the leadership of Gov. Tim Walz at one of the state's most consequential moments, and sparking a nationwide reckoning over racial discrimination and police misconduct.\n\n\"I specifically want to acknowledge racial harm that occurred when the substitute teacher reenacted the prone restraint that resulted in the murder of George Floyd,\" Principal Sarah Sorenson-Wanger wrote.\n\n\"This reported behavior is reprehensible. I am embarrassed, and I am sorry this happened to our students. We will take as much time as students need to listen and create open space for courageous conversations that lead to healing, action and education. The reported actions are not, and will not, be tolerated at Woodbury High School or in South Washington County Schools,\" the principal wrote.\n\nThe man was not identified in the letter, but it said he is not a police officer in Minnesota. Woodbury is a suburb southeast of St. Paul, and the eastern suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area extend into western Wisconsin.\n\nThe substitute was hired through Teachers on Call, a staffing agency that's part of the national Kelly Education employment network. The company said the man passed comprehensive background checks before he was placed.\n\n\"The actions of this individual were unacceptable, and the substitute teacher is no longer an employee of Teachers on Call,\" company spokesperson Danielle Nixon said in a statement. \"We recognize the significant public trust placed in us to ensure our substitute educators maintain a safe learning environment. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of violent, aggressive, or harmful behavior.\"\n\nCiting the ongoing investigation, she added that Teachers on Call is not releasing any additional information on its former employee.\n\nWoodbury Police Chief Jason Posel said in a statement Wednesday that his department is \"disturbed by the preliminary information of what occurred\" and will investigate this incident to the fullest extent, while showing compassion to the students impacted.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin Found Guilty On All Charges In George Floyd's Death\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior reporter, HuffPost\n\nDerek Chauvin has been convicted of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter in the death of George Floyd , concluding a trial that drew intense national interest and amplified concerns over the disparate ways police treat Americans of color.\n\nThe former Minneapolis officer, who is white, could face decades in prison. He was taken into custody following the reading of the verdict Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSentencing will take place in about eight weeks, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said.\n\nThe 12 jurors reached their verdict after roughly 10 hours of deliberation that began Monday, finding Chauvin guilty of third-degree murder, second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin was one of three officers who pinned down Floyd, a Black Minnesotan, for 9 minutes and 29 seconds last spring as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe while the officer knelt on his neck the entire time. Floyd's death sparked international racial justice protests in his name.\n\n\"George Floyd mattered,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said during a press conference after the verdict was announced. \"He was loved by his family and his friends ... But that isn't why he mattered. He mattered because he was a human being. And there is no way we can turn away from that reality.\"\n\nPhilonise Floyd, one of George Floyd's brothers, also spoke to praise the verdict and acknowledge other victims of police brutality.\n\n\"We have to always understand that we have to march. We will have to do this for life,\" he said. \"I'm not just fighting for George anymore. I'm fighting for everybody around this world.\"\n\nOver three weeks of testimony, prosecutors argued that Chauvin's method of restraint had hindered George Floyd's ability to breathe as he was pressed facedown on the street outside a convenience store called Cup Foods. A small group of bystanders ― several of them minors at the time ― took the stand to explain why they were so concerned for Floyd's safety as they witnessed him fighting to breathe underneath Chauvin.\n\nTestimony from his loved ones helped to illustrate the way Floyd's life and struggles mirrored those faced by many Americans. Floyd, 46, had been grappling with addiction for years after initially receiving an opioid prescription for pain. He had recently lost his job due to the coronavirus pandemic, and had tested positive for the virus in early April. He was still grieving for his deceased mother.\n\n\"On May 25, 2020, George Floyd died facedown on the pavement right on 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis,\" prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in his closing arguments . \" Nine minutes and 29 seconds. During this time, George Floyd struggled, desperate to breathe, to make enough room in his chest to breathe. But the force was too much. He was trapped.\"\n\n\"Facing George Floyd that day did not require one ounce of courage, and none was shown on that day,\" he told the jury. \"All that was required was a little compassion, and none was shown on that day ... This wasn't policing. This was murder.\"\n\nThroughout the trial, defense attorney Eric Nelson worked to sow reasonable doubt among jurors, trying to convince them that Floyd's preexisting health conditions mattered more to the final outcome than Chauvin's actions. The officers, Nelson suggested, were simply following police training and doing their best to make decisions under pressure while facing a possible threat from the small group of onlookers, several of whom were filming the incident on their phones. Nelson used the drugs in Floyd's system and his documented heart disease to substantiate the argument.\n\nAnticipating the defense's focus on Floyd's health, prosecutors were aided by several medical experts who said Floyd died of asphyxia, a common term for a lack of oxygen. They dismissed claims that drugs or underlying health issues played major roles in his death.\n\nDr. Martin Tobin, a top pulmonologist who works for a Chicago hospital, spent hours on the stand explaining with the help of slides, graphs and 3-D renderings how Floyd's positioning made it difficult ― and then impossible ― for him to breathe. Jurors followed along as Tobin showed how various parts of Floyd's anatomy were impacted, encouraging them to feel corresponding parts of their own necks.\n\nChauvin's position over Floyd made it so his left side was \"in a vise.\"\n\n\"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died as a result of what he was subjected to,\" Tobin testified.\n\nSeveral of Chauvin's former colleagues provided criticism of his actions, breaking the so-called \"blue wall of silence.\" Most notably, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testified that Chauvin \"absolutely\" violated the department's use-of-force policy.\n\nChauvin, however, chose not to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on the final day of the evidentiary portion of the trial.\n\nExperts called by the defense pointed to the unpredictable nature of police work and suggested the unusually large amount of video evidence still might not have told the whole story at the scene.\n\nPolice had been called to Cup Foods after a young cashier told his boss that he suspected Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The store had a policy that if a cashier accepted a fake bill, the amount would taken from their own wages. The cashier, Christopher Martin, 19, testified about the guilt he felt over Floyd's death.\n\n\"If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,\" Martin said in court.\n\nSeveral of the state's first few witnesses similarly felt emotional over the incident. Darnella Frazier, 18, the girl who filmed the video of Floyd's arrest that went viral in the aftermath, said Floyd appeared \"terrified.\"\n\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad,\" Frazier testified. \"I look at my brothers. I look at my cousins. I look at my uncles. Because they are all Black ... And I look at how that could have been one of them.\"\n\nFrazier's 9-year-old cousin who was with her at the time also spoke up in court.\n\nOutside the courtroom were scenes of resistance: Protesters carrying Black Lives Matter signs and flags rallied, at one point observing 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence led by the Rev. Al Sharpton ― the amount of time it was initially reported that Chauvin had knelt on top of Floyd. (The trial subsequently revealed the restraint to have lasted nearly 10 minutes.)\n\nThe mood shifted toward urgency by the end of the trial, after police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota ― a half-hour drive north of Cup Foods ― killed a Black man on April 11. Daunte Wright, 20, was shot by a veteran officer who says she mistook her firearm for a stun gun.\n\n\"This has to end,\" Ellison said Tuesday. \"We need true justice. That's not one case ― that is a social transformation that says nobody's beneath the law and nobody's above it. This verdict reminds us that we must make enduring systemic societal change.\"\n\nWright's mother, Katie Wright, joined Floyd's family in front of the Minneapolis courthouse to give a heart-wrenching press conference about her son.\n\nTo the south, in Chicago, a police accountability group released body camera video on April 15 showing the shocking death of 13-year-old Adam Toledo, who had empty hands raised when an officer shot and killed him.\n\nChauvin's conviction will undoubtedly raise questions in police departments across the country about use-of-force policies and how officers' actions will be evaluated.\n\n\"Police departments need to be reexamining their practices,\" Barbara McQuade, University of Michigan law professor and a former U.S. attorney, told HuffPost. The Chauvin case may \"send a message,\" she said, that police officers will \"no longer get the benefit of the doubt from a jury the way maybe you did 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\n\"And so you need to conform your behavior to a higher standard, because if you don't, you will be held accountable,\" McQuade said.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "George Floyd Died A Month Ago. There Have Been Protests Every Day Since.\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nGianna Floyd, the 6-year-old daughter of George Floyd , sat on the shoulders of her father's close friend earlier this month and declared: \"Daddy changed the world!\"\n\nGianna was right.\n\nThursday marks one month since Floyd, a Black man and 46-year-old father of five, was killed when Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Every day since, people across the country and around the world have marched in the streets to demand justice for him and other Black victims of police violence.\n\nTens of thousands of people have protested in over 100 cities in the United States. Protests also erupted around the world, including in Berlin, Paris, London, Toronto and São Paulo, sparking a renewed global reckoning over white supremacy, racism and police brutality. Every single day, people have swarmed the streets to chant \"Defund the police!\" and \"Black lives matter!\"\n\nJust this week, organizers in New York City held nine different events in one day throughout four boroughs. At least 100 people camped out in front of City Hall on Tuesday, calling for a $1 billion cut in funding to the New York City Police Department; they have vowed to stay outside the building until the city budget meeting on June 30. In Minnesota, organizers have held marches every single day and have planned a vigil for the one-month anniversary of Floyd's death. Protests are scheduled to continue in Minneapolis through the Fourth of July, according to Facebook .\n\nProtesters and organizers have already made progress in the fight against systemic racism, both within and outside of police departments. These victories are bittersweet ― it took brutal deaths to get them ― and overdue. The fight for reform is also far from over. But the fact that so much changed in one month highlights how historic this moment is.\n\n\"We know there are many new people finally listening to what we have been saying all along and now, it's time for solutions until we are transformed.\"\n\n\"We are heavy with the continued loss of lives like Raymond, Dominique, Tony, Riah, Toyin,\" said Kailee Scales, managing director of Black Lives Matter Global Network, naming other Black people who have been killed recently. \"Yet this global public outcry for justice leaves us hopeful for change.\"\n\nPublic opinion has also made a shift: Over the last two weeks, U.S. voters' support for Black Lives Matter has increased nearly as much as it did over the previous two years, The New York Times reported .\n\n\"Many of us recognize this moment as one to push even harder for transformation,\" Scales said. \"We know there are many new people finally listening to what we have been saying all along and now, it's time for solutions until we are transformed.\"\n\nThe most basic sign of justice is that some individual officers have been held accountable for their actions.\n\nIn Minneapolis, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder, and the three other officers involved in Floyd's death have been charged with aiding and abetting . Six police officers in Atlanta were charged after a video went viral showing cops using a stun gun and dragging two Black students from a car during protests. And in Buffalo, New York, two cops were charged with shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground. The protester's head hit the ground so hard that he fractured his skull and was in the hospital for two weeks.\n\nThe police department in Louisville, Kentucky, has also held some officers accountable for their actions: The police chief was fired and two officers were placed on administrative leave after David McAtee, a Black chef, was shot and killed when police responded to a large gathering after a curfew. One of the three officers in the city who executed a no-knock search warrant at the home of Breonna Taylor, a Black EMT, was also fired. Taylor was shot at least eight times and died in her hallway after police barged into her home unannounced. The Louisville City Council has since passed Breonna's Law , which bans no-knock search warrants.\n\nFloyd's death has also brought renewed attention to police violence against Black women and Black transgender people , and we have seen more attention and urgency paid to past police violence and killings. More than 2 million people have signed a petition urging Colorado lawmakers to reopen an investigation into the killing of Elijah McClain , a 23-year-old Black man who died nearly a year ago when an Aurora cop put him in a chokehold. Even the death of Taylor, the EMT from Louisville, didn't receive much national attention for two months; it became part of the public discussion about police brutality after Floyd was killed.\n\nThe calls to defund the police and invest in communities of color have also led to some changes across the country. In Los Angeles, the city council introduced a proposal to redirect at least $100 million to $150 million from the LAPD's budget to disadvantaged communities. In Minneapolis, a veto-proof majority of city council members pledged to \"begin the process of ending\" the city's police department and promised to invest in a \"new transformative model for cultivating safety.\" And in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a proposal to cut the police department's budget and shift some of that money to programs that will help communities of color.\n\nPolice reform is now a topic of discussion in Congress , which in itself is a big step forward. However, most Republican lawmakers have not gotten on board with many of the police reform proposals put forward by Black Lives Matter and other groups. Many Democrats , including presumptive nominee Joe Biden , are also shying away from demands to defund the police .\n\nSome schools are finally cutting ties with police departments, acquiescing to the long-held belief by many organizers that policing schools does not actually keep children safe. The Minneapolis public school board voted earlier this month to end its relationship with the city's police, and board members for the school district in Oakland, California, unanimously voted this week to eliminate its police department. The superintendent of Portland, Oregon's public school system also said he was \"discontinuing\" the use of police officers in schools in the state.\n\nFloyd's death has also forced many to acknowledge America's history of slavery and racism. Many have finally learned that policing was first created to return enslaved people to white slave owners.\n\nOthers are using this moment to topple monuments of Confederate leaders , of which there are over 1,700 in the U.S. People have ripped down monuments in states including Alabama, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy. Lawmakers in many states and cities - and even Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi - have called for Confederate statues to be removed.\n\nThe tech, media and sports industries are all facing a reckoning over racism in their own ranks. NASCAR announced that it would ban the display of the Confederate flag at all its events, and the NFL commissioner admitted the league was wrong for not allowing players to peacefully protest police brutality during the national anthem. Additionally, several TV shows, including \"Cops\" and \"Live PD,\" were canceled due to their depictions of police brutality.\n\nAlthough this progress has been hard-fought and well-earned, there is much more work to be done. Many issues still remain: Chauvin and the other officers involved in Floyd's death still may get off; none of the Louisville cops who killed Taylor have been charged in her death; we have yet to see if city council members from across the country will actually follow through on their promises to divest from police and invest in communities of color.\n\nAnd one major issue lingers: What happens when no one is filming these incidents of police brutality and racism? How many times has there been no video?\n\nThis is not the time to rest, Scales said, because communities of color deserve reinvestment.\n\n\"Imagine a world where a mental health episode was met with compassion and nurturing instead of an armed officer. Imagine a world where housing was offered to the houseless instead of people being met by individuals trained to de escalate with violence,\" she said. \"It's time to reimagine what protection and safety can look like.\""

      "text": "I'm Due To Give Birth Today But All I Can Think About Is George Floyd\n\nGuest Writer\n\nNote: This piece was written on May 28, 2020.\n\nToday is my due date, and I can't stop thinking about George Floyd .\n\nI keep telling myself I shouldn't be thinking about \"things like this\" right now, that the moments before I give birth should be spent in meditative relaxation. Surely, now is the time to reflect on the beauty and hope of new life, not the pain and ugliness of this world. But my mind keeps wandering back to a Black man's face being flattened into the ground by the weight of a cop's knee, his eyes begging for mercy he would not receive.\n\nThe promise of an empty bassinet and carefully folded newborn onesies sit in front of me, but I can't breathe. As I read the news of George Floyd's murder, I feel that same bronchial constriction that I've felt each time I hear of a new police assassination of a Black American.\n\nI am reminded that, as a Black person in America, we have rarely in life taken a deep breath. As my airways tighten, and I search for the right relaxation mantra to calm myself, I think of my two Black brothers, my Black father, and my Black cousins in Minneapolis. I beg my mind not to play the slideshow again ― the flashing images of the many ways I've imagined finding out that one of them has been killed in a chance police encounter. I can't breathe.\n\nEvery new police murder of a Black victim digs at the same wound, the initial trauma I felt as a school-age child when I learned of this legacy ― the Emmett Tills and Rodney Kings and all who followed them.\n\nThis painful discovery was cradled by my short lifetime of already knowing; even as children, we know the reality of racism before we are taught to name it. By age 8, I had already been taught to fear the police as a matter of basic social hygiene.\n\nWith time and exposure, these wounds have scabbed. It seems that the coverage of these murders is so frequent that, I am ashamed to admit, I lose track of the names and my eyes glaze across the news more often than I pause to mourn the dead these days. Like many Americans, the pain from Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor 's grotesque murders is still so fresh, it feels unjust to have to process yet another loss so soon.\n\n\"Floyd's murder immediately exposed my deepest layers of grief ... Seeing police calmly and slowly murdering a Black man in front of a distressed crowd utterly disturbs my faith in humanity, but also because of the familiarity of home.\"\n\nSome of these murders hurt deeper than others. Floyd's murder immediately exposed my deepest layers of grief, in part because seeing police calmly and slowly murdering a Black man in front of a distressed crowd utterly disturbs my faith in humanity, but also because of the familiarity of home. I am a child of the Twin Cities, born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, raised mostly in Bloomington, in one of the many cookie-cutter homes occupied by working class and immigrant families raised in the shadow of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport, and eventually the Mall of America.\n\nMy nursing assistant mother and cab driver/security guard/perennial-entrepreneur father, like so many of my neighbors, worked their ways into the suburbs to give their children that elusive gift of \"a better life.\" This leap was particularly large for my father, who was born in a Yoruba village in southern Nigeria, the second youngest of 12 children, with no memory of his own father who died of a heart attack when he was only 4 years old.\n\nLike all African immigrants to the United States, I'm sure my father has complicated feelings about his own experience of being Black in America, but from a young age he presented to me a very clear message on my own Blackness. As a recovering perfectionist, I still often hear his regular before-school refrain: \"You are Black and you are a woman; you will have to work twice as hard as everyone else.\"\n\nMostly left on our own while our parents worked overtime and second jobs that could not keep them from two bankruptcies, a lot of violence and an ugly divorce, my brother and I found our own ways of navigating life in the Twin Cities. Our \"better\" suburban schools were less burdened by overt violence than some inner-city counterparts, but were steeped in Minnesota's particular brand of white supremacy ― neatly packaged in \"Minneosta-nice\" progressivism, the kind that pats itself on the back for how fair it is.\n\nFor my part, I opted for the escape of success, dedicating myself to becoming president of as many clubs and teams and achieving as many A+s as humanly possible. My brother followed the other path of escape, seeking as much attention as trouble could bring him. Only later as an adult, after reading a report about systemic racism in Bloomington public schools, did I think about how we both suffered the insidious harm of Minnesota's \"polite\" racism in our own ways.\n\nThis report showed how students of color are disproportionately suspended and expelled, as my brother was for multiple pranks and fights, until he was finally pushed out of the school system entirely, never completing his high school degree. (My very intelligent brother eventually got his GED and worked his way through a challenging electrician's apprenticeship.) The report showed, on the flip side, that Bloomington students of color are grossly underrepresented in achievement opportunities; I acutely remember the feeling of often being the only Black person in my gifted program and the deep sense of unworthiness that instilled in me as a child.\n\nBut, despite the many statistics that demonstrate that life for Black people in Minnesota is marked by unfair treatment and discriminatory systems, many Minnesotans hold on to the belief that life is at least \"better\" there because of Minnesotan progressiveness.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I found my fastest way out of the Twin Cities ― a full ride to Grinnell College, running from a difficult childhood and seeking that \"better\" we are all after. My first student trip brought me to the South for the first time, a volunteer trip to a hurricane-ravaged New Orleans. With a lens that was admittedly fogged by a sense of northern elitism, I was both appalled and fascinated by the extreme racial disparities that the human and natural disasters of Katrina exposed.\n\n\"I found myself drawn to the open secret of social hierarchy, which was a more taboo topic in the Midwest. People talked openly about race and class, and how it affected them.\"\n\nOn that and subsequent visits to the South, I found myself drawn to the open secret of social hierarchy, which was a more taboo topic in the Midwest. People talked openly about race and class, and how it affected them. People said ugly, truthful things, which were echoed back to them in the reality of their lives. Somehow that felt safer to me - and I delighted in being in a majority Black city, walking down a street and blending in. I found myself breathing deeper than I could in the polite stuffiness of Minnesota.\n\nBy my second year of college, I knew I'd move to the South when I graduated. I remember telling my father that I had accepted a post-graduate fellowship in New Orleans, and his fearful reply: \"But people are racist down there!\" At 22, I laughed at my Black immigrant father's willingness to buy into the Minnesotan narrative; despite his two decades of personal experience with discrimination ― in work, in housing, in banking, in the criminal justice system ― my father had been taught that the \"real racism,\" the kind to be feared, was \"down South.\"\n\nAs a soon-to-be parent of two, I can empathize with that desire to believe now; I see that in order to have the strength to raise our children in this world, we need to believe there is hope where we are and that our children will somehow benefit from it. We need to believe in a \"better.\"\n\nLooking at photos of Floyd smiling and posing for the camera, I feel my womb heave as I try not to cry. I try to take some deep breaths and send them to the baby, try to find strength in the chant of \"Black lives matter.\" Ahmaud Arbery's family's lawyer said that \"his life mattered\" while arguing for Arbery's assailants to be arrested and convicted.\n\nStill, I try to sigh away the painful knowledge that this society is constructed around the assertion that my baby's life - like Arbery, Taylor and Floyd's - already matters less than its white counterparts before it has even left the womb. But Black mothers in America have always known what it is like to carry a life that the world has already decided will not matter. I think of George Floyd's pregnant mother and I wonder, when he slid from her warm body, how acutely could she feel his mortality? Or did she choose to believe that things would be better for her son, that they must be?\n\nThis is why we chant, sing and write \"Black lives matter,\" and why the birth justice movement reminds us that \"Black birth matters.\" We burn to make these assertions become truth. Because America, you have already written the rationale for our murder, manufactured the blame for our incarceration, and defined the cause of our disease, before we are even born.\n\nAs a Black American murdered by the police, before your killer is even questioned, the first thing the world will know is a list of your wrongs. We are all complex people, our lives made up of beauty and ugliness, victories and mistakes. When my personal anxiety slideshow starts, and I see the many ways my family members might die in a fateful encounter with the police, I think of my father. I think of how, before his Black body would even be cold, the world would rather hear of his arrest record than to know he is a father and grandfather, that he is bilingual, or that, when we were little, he would rally all the kids at the playground into one big game of \"monster tag\" that we would play past dusk, until the mosquitos stuck to the sweat on our skin.\n\n\"I was quickly reminded that as Black folks, our untimely deaths are already explained for us.\"\n\nI've had the opportunity of late to worry about things a bit more universal, like a global pandemic . I've channeled my anxiety into worries of hospital policies for birthing partners and doulas, and how to plan a postpartum meal train with social distancing and hygiene precautions. Although stressful, there has been some relief in worrying about an issue that felt indiscriminate and universal. But, of course, it isn't.\n\nA few weeks into the pandemic in the U.S., the data started to show what should not have surprised any of us ― that this devastating disease is far more devastating for Black and Brown communities . In my first surge of disappointment, I realized I had actually been hoping that this would finally be one exception in a world of racial disparities. Hearing my spiteful Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy explain that Black people are predisposed to dying from this disease - ignoring social determinants of health like stress, poverty, and racism in favor of racist biological determinism - I was quickly reminded that as Black folks, our untimely deaths are already explained for us.\n\nKnowing we matter less is a burden we carry in and out of every day, every social interaction. I am one of the privileged Americans who is not an \"essential worker,\" and who has been able to quarantine safely at home for the last two months.\n\nRecently, I had to leave the house for a medical appointment, and realized that life at home with my family had allowed me to let my guard down. Like so many of us, my quarantine life has meant infrequent hair washing and forgetting about bras entirely. As I entered a once-busy office building for my appointment, mask on and hand sanitizer in hand, I was greeted by empty halls and dimmed lights.\n\nOn the short walk to the elevator, I met almost no one, until I passed the front desk where three employees stopped their conversation and followed me with suspicious eyes until I got on the elevator. Their gaze expressed without words, \"Should you be here?\"\n\nOnce the elevator doors closed, my reflection in the glass door told me why: In my homebound state, I had not bothered to comb or oil my hair, which was threatening to burst out of the loose hair tie on my head. Three inches of my brown belly hung out from the bottom of my no-longer-adequate maternity tee, above basketball shorts and flip-flops. And I was masked, an inherently risky look for people of color no matter what situation they find themselves in.\n\nFeeling my heart pounding, I immediately thought of multiple stereotypes of Black women that I could easily be forced into at this moment, and envisioned how the mostly white staff in this building might react if they thought I was sneaking around the dark hallways. My mind went through a checklist that Black and brown people in this country must learn to use.\n\nLike I did as a teenager when the clerks at a Mall of America clothing store would follow me around the store with that same questioning look ― \"Should you be here?\" ― I asked myself, \"How can I look less threatening?\" I pulled my mask down a bit to expose more of my eyes and cheekbones so I could look like I was smiling; I attempted to tug my shirt down to cover more of my belly; and I made my hands clearly visible. I sighed relief into my cloth mask an hour later, when I finally reached my car after my appointment.\n\n\"The roll of the genetic die that determines how 'Black' you look also determines how the world will see you. How many mistakes will you be allowed to make? How quickly will they blame you for your own expulsion, incarceration, death? How lucky will you be?\"\n\nWith my brown skin and frizzy hair, I have experienced both anti-Black racism and light-skin privilege throughout my life. Apparently as a compliment, a high-school friend once called me \"the Minnesota blend,\" while New Orleanian cat-callers holler \"hey red\" and \"brown sugar don't melt baby\" to me as I stroll these humid streets.\n\nMy family is mixed race; if you lined us all up you'd see a variety of skin tones, hair textures, and more. The fun curiosity of waiting to see what and who my baby will look like is tinged with a darker anxiety. With my first baby, I remember the mix of joy and fear as I watched her skin darken over time and wondered if her baby curls would loosen or tighten. Behind clichés like \"good hair\" are a bitter truth; the roll of the genetic die that determines how \"Black\" you look also determines how the world will see you. How many mistakes will you be allowed to make? How quickly will they blame you for your own expulsion, incarceration, death? How lucky will you be?\n\nMost of the time, I feel hopeful. I decided to create and birth my babies out of hope, because I believe in our human potential for good and that the struggle for social justice is worth fighting. I believe that we can build a better Minnesota, a better country and a better world. But sometimes that hope is obscured by fear and darkness.\n\nIn moments like this one, I fear that for too many Black people in America, being lucky doesn't even mean surviving. Being lucky is just having enough witnesses around to film your death and share it with the world. Somehow justice isn't living your life to its full potential; it's begging for your murderers to be arrested and convicted of a crime.\n\nI sat down to write this in an attempt to release some of the overwhelming anger and grief burdening my heart. But now I need to turn my attention to my higher purpose in this moment: to give birth to our newest member of society, and to make sure they know from the moment they're born, that despite what the world may tell them, their life matters. We can build a better future where that is true.\n\nLatona Giwa is a perinatal health advocate, birth doula, registered nurse and lactation consultant in New Orleans.

      "text": "3 Other Ex-Cops Face Charges In George Floyd's Murder. Here's What's Next For Them.\n\nSenior reporter, HuffPost\n\nWith Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict secured, the state of Minnesota turns its attention to the three other former police officers facing charges in George Floyd's murder.\n\nJ. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao were charged last summer with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They are set to stand trial together in August.\n\nLane and Kueng helped Chauvin pin Floyd facedown on the street during an arrest attempt outside a convenience store in Minneapolis in May 2020. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes while Floyd repeatedly stated he couldn't breathe and eventually ceased speaking, moving and breathing.\n\nThao, Chauvin's partner at the time, stood between the officers and a group of bystanders filming the violent arrest. As Floyd gasped for air, Thao callously told the onlookers that Floyd's arrest was an example of \"why you don't do drugs.\"\n\nAfter a weekslong, closely watched trial, Chauvin was convicted Tuesday of second- and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter. Here's how those guilty verdicts could impact the other former officers' trial, according to legal experts.\n\nNo trial is ever a \"slam dunk,\" and this one isn't poised to be an exception, despite prosecutors succeeding in the Chauvin case, said Howard University School of Law Professor Adam Kurland.\n\nChauvin's conviction isn't something that can be introduced as evidence in the other officers' trial, meaning the state will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a new jury that Chauvin murdered Floyd.\n\nThough prosecutors can present the same videos and witnesses they tapped for Chauvin's trial, several key factors will be different, including the defense attorneys and the jurors. (Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Chauvin's trial, will do the same in the other former officers' trial.)\n\n\"The defendants in this case ... can only be found guilty if in their trial it's proved that they aided and abetted Chauvin's criminal conduct, which is going to have to be reproved,\" said Kurland, a former federal prosecutor for the state of California. \"And that is where it gets a little bit dicey.\"\n\n\"That would have been the same had Chauvin been acquitted,\" he added.\n\nJohn Farmer Jr., director of Rutger University's Eagleton Institute of Politics, said going to trial is a \"roll of the dice.\"\n\n\"There are so many variables ― the quality of the jury, the quality of the witnesses,\" said Farmer, the former attorney general for New Jersey. \" You can't take for granted that you're going to get the same result.\"\n\nIt's possible the jury will find that culpability varies by defendant, potentially resulting in a mixed bag of verdicts.\n\nBoth Kueng and Lane were in their first week on the job as full officers when Chauvin murdered Floyd. Kueng was 26 years old at the time and Lane was 37.\n\nThao, who was 34 at the time of Floyd's arrest, had been working for the Minneapolis Police Department for nine years. He had six misconduct complaints filed against him during his career with the department, reported The New York Times .\n\nAttorneys for Kueng, Lane and Thao did not immediately respond to HuffPost's requests for comment.\n\nBoth Kurland and Farmer said they expected the Chauvin conviction to potentially trigger at least one or more guilty pleas from the other officers ahead of their trial.\n\n\"Only a sliver of a fraction of criminal cases in federal court go to trial,\" Kurland said. \"Statistically, I think it's unlikely that all three of the defendants are going to go to trial, which means at least one is going to be resolved by plea.\"\n\nFarmer said there are \"strong incentives on both sides\" to enter plea negotiations. He said he expects the defense attorneys to \"think really long and hard about whether they want to go to trial,\" adding, however, it's unclear what kind of potential plea deals would even be on the table.\n\nUltimately, it's too early to tell, according to both Kurland and Farmer.\n\n\"There are so many variables ― the quality of the jury, the quality of the witnesses. You can't take for granted that you're going to get the same result.\"\n\nNicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, a sociology professor at Brown University and a criminal justice expert, said she thought the officers were more likely to stand trial, given what unfolded after the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald.\n\nMcDonald, a Black teenager, was fatally shot by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, who is white, 16 times as he was walking away from the officer.\n\nVan Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder in 2018. But three officers who were tried for allegedly conspiring and lying to protect Van Dyke were acquitted in a subsequent trial. Those officers, who are also white, were accused of writing in official reports that McDonald had tried to stab several officers. Video recorded by the officers' body cameras contradicted that account.\n\n\"To me, it feels like the most analogous case,\" Gonzalez Van Cleve said. \"It was upsetting because it was so demonstrative of how these cover-ups happen and the fact that they're systemic.\"\n\nThough the so-called \"blue wall of silence\" was cracked in Chauvin's trial when current and former police officers testified against his actions, Gonzalez Van Cleve isn't convinced those witnesses will do the same in the upcoming trial.\n\n\"As soon as they got their one scapegoat, they protected the remaining,\" she said of the McDonald murder.\n\nJust as Eric Nelson did in Chauvin's trial, it's likely the defense attorneys for the three former officers will file motions for a change of venue and jury sequestration given the high-profile nature of the proceedings.\n\n\"They'd be hard-pressed to find another jurisdiction where there hasn't been saturation coverage\" of the Chauvin trial, Farmer said. \"It would certainly be in their interest to say that all of this is too soon and the judge may be sympathetic of that.\"\n\nStill, change in venue motions are often made but rarely granted, Kurland said.\n\nAnother potential move the officers might consider would be to elect a bench trial, in which the trial takes place only in front of a judge and there is no jury. The three officers accused of covering up Van Dyke's conduct in the McDonald murder opted for a bench trial and were acquitted.\n\nThree Baltimore police officers were acquitted in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man who died after sustaining injuries while being transported in a police van, after electing separate bench trials.\n\n\"If I were the prosecutors, I would not oppose a bench trial,\" Kurland said. \"The question is, would the defendant want it?\"\n\nTo Gonzalez Van Cleve, the defense's potential preference for a bench trial could come down to a judge's \"prosecutorial mindset\" and how that might bode well for the former police officers being tried.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Uninvited and Unaccountable: How CBP Policed George Floyd Protests\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThousands of pages of newly released documents detail CBP's involvement in policing the 2020 racial justice protests.\n\nAt the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, Customs and Border Protection encouraged officers to consider more lethal force when making arrests to protect themselves against the highly contagious virus, according to newly uncovered agency documents.\n\n\"Frequently, the necessity to use force, especially less-lethal force, requires an officer or agent to be in direct proximity and in personal contact with individual(s),\" reads an April 2020 CBP memo . \"If an officer or agent reasonably believes a subject may be infected with COVID-19, the threat of transmitting the virus to resist or evade arrest should be considered when establishing the immanency of a threat and the resulting determination of objectively reasonable force.\"\n\nThe memo listed \"electronic control weapons\" (stun guns like Tasers) and \"compressed air and munition launchers\" (guns with rubber bullets) as tools that CBP officers could use from a safe distance.\n\nIn the coming months, CBP officers would join the sprawling law enforcement response to the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 - even policing George Floyd's funeral. The agency made headlines that summer for deploying a surveillance drone in Minneapolis and when unidentifiable Border Patrol officers whisked away a protester in Portland, Oregon. But new documents , obtained by legal advocates through Freedom of Information Act litigation, reveal the extent of CBP's involvement, conducting arrests and barraging protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets - sometimes without the knowledge of other agencies, city or state leaders, or even CBP officials themselves.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe records - released by the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the American Immigration Council, and the University of California Irvine School of Law's Immigrant Rights Council - reveal that CBP deployed officers to at least 18 cities and towns across the country. That list includes Chicago; Minneapolis; Buffalo, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; Louisville, Kentucky; and Whitefish, Montana. Dozens more law enforcement agencies requested assistance or equipment from CBP, the heavily redacted records show, though the agency did not appear to fulfill every request.\n\nThe agency's redactions of the document set, which consists of thousands of pages, conceal the number of officers deployed throughout the summer and other details about the operation.\n\nCBP did not respond to The Intercept's questions.\n\nEmily Creighton, the legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council, said that CBP's involvement in policing protests - even when it was not asked to - \"raises concerns about mission creep.\"\n\nThe agency redacted the documents under an exception to protect law enforcement techniques, a justification Creighton said does not make sense given that the CBP operation concluded years ago. \"If anything, the agency's painstaking efforts to redact information contained in the records demonstrates a careful effort to conceal the extent of the agency's involvement,\" said Creighton, whether the CBP was doing so \"to avoid embarrassment or in a blind adherence to redaction versus disclosure - a longstanding pattern with CBP and antithetical to the purpose of FOIA - a law intended to reveal to the public what its government is up to.\"\n\nCBP started policing protests within a week of Floyd's death on May 25, the documents show. On June 1, the Department of Justice requested CBP agencies - including Border Patrol, the Office of Field Operations, and Air and Marine Operations - to \"assist Federal partners with general law enforcement activities.\"\n\nThe agency is generally authorized to operate within 100 miles of land and coastal borders, though that remit can be extended. On June 26, 2020, then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing numerous agencies - including the Department of Homeland Security, CBP's parent agency - to provide assistance for \"the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property\" amid the mass protests.\n\nThe documents reveal that CBP officers provided \"situational awareness\" for police departments, conducted \"general law enforcement activities\" and \"crowd control,\" monitored encrypted online chat rooms, and even arrested protesters.\n\nThe documents also include a breakdown of the agency's aerial surveillance operations from Uvalde, Texas, and Miami to Dayton and New York City.\n\nJeramie Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center's Project on Surveillance Oversight, said that such surveillance has a chilling effect on protesters' First Amendment rights. \"Agencies like CBP have no business conducting domestic surveillance and law enforcement operations that have nothing to do with the agency's mission,\" he said. \"Surveillance tech will not solve structural racism in this country but has and will continue to exacerbate it without meaningful change.\"\n\nIn some cases, it was local police departments that called on CBP for assistance. On June 4, 2020, the police chief in Pearland, Texas, solicited the help of the Border Patrol in preparation for Floyd's funeral. The chief listed CBP capabilities including \"tactical support with armored vehicles,\" \"less lethal force options\" (rubber bullets), and \"drone surveillance\" as reasons for why they were reaching out for help. The CBP obliged and deployed officers to the community for nearly a week.\n\nTsion Gurmu, legal director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, viewed the CBP deployment to Floyd's funeral as emblematic of a colossal operation with little answerability. \"It is disturbing to know that enormous resources were spent to send federal law enforcement to team up with local law enforcement across the country to quash Black organizing, not to mention the militaristic language used to describe their role (e.g., developing a battle rhythm) and surveillance reaching as far as George Floyd's funeral,\" Gurmu said. \"It's clear that we still don't have a full picture or understanding of the role of federal law enforcement and immigration agencies, and what role they might play in future policing efforts. We expect CBP to be primarily at our borders, but it seems that their authority far surpasses that.\"\n\nArmed members of the U.S. Border Patrol gather as peaceful protests continue citywide against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on June 3, 2020 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe documents indicate that, at times, senior CBP officials were caught off guard by news reports of their own agency's involvement in the protests.\n\nAfter Vice reported that the CBP flew a Predator drone over Minneapolis during the outset of the protests in May, for instance, Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan sent an email to colleagues seeking more information. \"Is this correct? Who asked [for] the support? What support are we providing?\" Morgan wrote . \"What authority are we using to provide the support?\"\n\nIn mid-July, a video depicting a Portland protester being whisked away into an unmarked vehicle by unidentified officers went viral. The Nation soon reported that the officers were from CBP, but the documents show that in the immediate aftermath, even higher-level CBP officials were not quite sure.\n\n\"I see CBP is on the chain and may have additional info, because it is my understanding that it is very likely that the officers in the Twitter video were from CBP and using a rental minivan to conduct the apprehension on the video,\" one official wrote , in an email chain discussing a press response to the video. \"CBP was looking into this last night to obtain more facts.\"\n\nThe Portland incident took place just after Morgan had recommended that CBP officers take \"a more enhanced proactive posture\" in response to the city's protesters. In a July 15 email , Morgan also wrote of his desire \"to ask for enhanced FBI engagement from an investigative standpoint to identify the organizers and modes of communication to proactively disrupt the actions of these criminals,\" adding that \"we must move more aggressively beyond reactive enforcement.\"\n\n\"I know we've had a call and there is a set of actions in place, but I'm recommending ramping-up our presence there and being even more proactive in making arrests,\" Morgan wrote. \"If the local police will not take meaningful actions nor will the Governor call in the National Guard, then it's up to us.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nAs federal agencies, including CBP, prepared to deploy agents to Chicago to quell protests, a Department of Homeland Security director acknowledged that their presence was not invited. \"There has been no request from the State or City for federal assistance,\" the official wrote . \"Other cities are being discussed for possible additional 'surge ops'. Two cities mentioned were Kansas City and Albuquerque.\"\n\nThe records show that \"CBP lacked real understanding about its own role at the protests,\" said Creighton, of American Immigration Council. \"The agency's own numerous reports describing protester activity reveal that most protests were peaceful, that the show of force from CBP was not necessary, and when CBP's presence was revealed, it was shocking and unwelcome to protesters and the general public.\"\n\nSome CBP officers may not have been equipped to do the kind of work they were doing at all, and the records show officers in some jurisdictions received rushed additional training just days before their deployments. \"All efforts must be taken to ensure the safety of CBP personnel and they should not be placed in roles that put them in direct contact with the public since they do not possess the appropriate crowd control training and equipment,\" one CBP field liaison director wrote ahead of a deployment in Los Angeles.\n\nThe emails also show that CBP officials felt they were not getting due credit for their policing of protests. \"As you can see, OFO deployed significant resources and provided a substantive response to the civil unrest around the nation,\" an official from the CBP's Office of Field Operations wrote in a June 2020 email. The official expressed concern that \"the majority\" of the agency's activity was not represented in a report for the DHS Office of Operations Coordination, or OPS. \"Can you ensure that our activity is included in the final report and not substantially chopped as it has been in the last couple days. OPS does perform an initial chop.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Pro-Cop PAC Tried to Fundraise by Blaming George Floyd for His Own Death\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAfter local news coverage, the Protect Our Police PAC quickly condemned its own email and distanced itself from Derek Chauvin.\n\nA political action committee working to elect pro-police candidates to state and local office apologized last week for sending a fundraising email that blamed George Floyd for his own death. The Protect Our Police PAC formed in Philadelphia last June after nationwide protests against police brutality with the goal of ousting Larry Krasner, the city's reformist district attorney . In the nine months since its inception, the group has backed candidates across at least 15 states. This is not the first time the committee has come under criticism for distributing racist materials.\n\n\"Our founding fathers knew the importance of a fair justice system, but unhinged radical cop haters are taking every opportunity to pervert the law to advance their agenda. That's exactly what's happening in Minnesota to officer Derek Chauvin,\" read the April 1 email. \"Let's get one thing clear: George Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 and was high on a lethal dose of fentanyl when he died May 25th, 2020... but the mainstream media doesn't want you to know that!\" Sent from the organizationwide POP PAC account, the email was signed by President/Treasurer Nick Gerace, a former Philadelphia police officer.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Gerace blamed the message on a marketing firm, saying that the email did not reflect his values or those of the PAC and that the group had since terminated its relationship with the firm. The statement claimed that the PAC had hired the marketing team several months before, but it did not name the firm, nor did it address why it had apparently not shown its client the content for approval before sending it out. Gerace did not answer questions from The Intercept about whether anyone at POP PAC had reviewed the contents before distribution, whether the PAC had returned contributions it received through the email's donation links, or whether the PAC could name the marketing firm.\n\nOriginal reporting.

When several former Philadelphia police officers started POP PAC in June, their stated goal was to help \"recruit and elect candidates that will never turn their backs on our Police Officers and other first responders on the front line.\"\n\nRelated Chauvin Defense Witness Faces Lawsuit of His Own Over Death of Black Teenager in Police Custody\n\nThe PAC got its start with an early investment of $10,000 from the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5, which represents the Philadelphia Police Department and is among Krasner's strongest critics. The police union is backing Krasner's opponent, former homicide prosecutor Carlos Vega , and POP PAC had been expected to follow suit. But after last week's email, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Vega has said he doesn't want the group's backing.\n\nVega is still campaigning with the local FOP, which gave another $70,000 to POP PAC between January and March of this year. One of the PAC's most prominent supporters is Republican Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune and a top donor to former President Donald Trump. Mellon, who once called federal programs like the Affordable Care Act and food stamps \"slavery redux,\" has provided POP PAC with more than two-thirds of its funds.\n\nAsked about accepting support from FOP while distancing his campaign from POP PAC, Vega told The Intercept that he would hold the FOP accountable, which he sees as a top voter concern.\n\nPOP PAC has also faced criticism for failing to file its campaign finance disclosures on time. It raised just over $730,000 in 2020 \"from thousands of donors from all 50 states,\" according to its website . The group is a state PAC registered in Pennsylvania, not a federal PAC, and as such is required to follow state and local reporting requirements wherever it operates. In Georgia, for example, the registered affiliated POP GA PAC filed its 2020 campaign disclosures in February 2021, four months after the October deadline . In Pennsylvania, POP PAC filed two of its 2020 campaign disclosures in February 2021, months after the October and December deadlines. The first state and local filing deadlines for 2021 in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia were on Tuesday; the group did not meet them.\n\nLast Thursday's email lamented \"months of violent looting and riots that caused over a billion dollars in damages, hundreds of small business closures, dozens of untimely deaths, and millions of dollars profited from left-wing organizations like Black Lives Matter.\" Now, it went on, \"Chauvin is facing trial for a murder he did not commit - leftist radicals want to make an example out of an innocent man that followed the protocol he learned in his training. They want to ruin his life for political gain.\"\n\nThe next day, after the Philadelphia Inquirer reported on the email's contents , Gerace condemned Chauvin's actions , saying they \"were examples of bad policing and poor training that directly caused George Floyd's death, in my opinion.\" The email's \"messaging and innuendo\" were \"not in line with our mission and I vehemently denounce it,\" he continued. \"We can do better. We will do better. We must do better.\"\n\nGerace's comments reflect the significant pressure law enforcement groups are feeling as public opinion on policing and patterns of brutality has shifted since Chauvin killed Floyd last year. Gerace claims the case touched on one of the main motivations for starting the PAC. \"Not all cops are bad or bastards,\" his statement read. \"No one hates a dirty cop more than a good cop.\"\n\nAsked to comment further, Gerace said he had been on record numerous times in the last year \"saying the opposite of what is in this email. I don't agree with its contents at all.\"\n\nOther fundraising emails sent from the PAC this year call Black Lives Matter an \"anti-cop operation\" with a \"twisted ideology\"; claim \"blood is on [the] hands\" of the \"defund the police movement\" for endangering police and everyday citizens; and decry the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a police reform bill that the House passed in March, as \"something that should scare us all.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nLast year, the group's Georgia affiliate faced similar backlash over campaign billboards and literature with racist and anti-Semitic messaging during the district attorney's race in Georgia's Chatham County.\n\nOne mailer pictured Shalena Cook Jones, a Black woman and the Democratic challenger to Republican incumbent Meg Heap, holding up a sideways peace sign next to George Soros. The mailer read: \"Billionaire liberal George Soros has funded unqualified district attorneys in cities across America in an effort to buy our criminal justice system.\" The PAC paid for billboards picturing Cook Jones making the same gesture, which some local observers, including academics and media outlets, thought was designed to look like a gang symbol. The group made an independent expenditure to support Heap, who said the billboards showed \"distasteful content,\" and the PAC later took them down. In a statement last October, the PAC said criticisms of the ads as racist and anti-Semitic were \"false accusations meant to discredit and distract.\" POP PAC spent just over $50,000 on the Georgia race, but Jones, backed by the Soros-funded Justice & Public Safety PAC, defeated the incumbent.\n\nDespite the Philadelphia's police union's support for Vega, Krasner's opponent, Gerace said the PAC has never and would not seek to back Vega directly. \"POP PAC has never sought to endorse him because our effort has been laser-focused on holding DA Krasner accountable for his dangerous policies and deadly consequences,\" Gerace told The Intercept. \"We have not and will not endorse or directly support his campaign.\"\n\nAccording to Sergio Cea, an organizer with Reclaim Philadelphia, which is backing Krasner, the sentiments in the fundraising email are typical of police forces in the Philadelphia area. \"This is like a pattern of what police do in Philadelphia, fundraise off of the abuse in our community,\" Cea said. He noted that last year, the local police union sold T-shirts with the name of an officer who had abused protesters with a baton over the summer.\n\n\"It's one thing if you're saying this stuff to police officers,\" said Cea. \"But if you're talking to everyday Philadelphians and voters, many of them who have been brutalized by the police department in Philadelphia, these kinds of news stories lead them to say, 'You know what, no matter what I'm gonna back Krasner.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "NYPD to Pay Largest Protester Settlement Ever for Abuses During George Floyd Uprising\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWhat plaintiffs said was the largest protest payout ever was helped along by a forensic reconstruction of the NYPD's attack on demonstrators.\n\nNew York City reached a historic settlement this week on behalf of more than 1,300 people who were attacked by police while protesting the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the New York Police Department violated protesters' civil and constitutional rights by making mass arrests, using excessive force, using pepper spray improperly, and using a tactic called kettling to trap and arrest protesters ahead of an imposed curfew.\n\nThe proposed settlement will pay out $13 million to 1,380 protesters - about $10,000 per person - the largest total payout to protesters in a class-action suit in the United States, according to the plaintiffs. The settlement did not impose any reforms on the NYPD.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhat the suit means for policing will depend on how New Yorkers and the city respond, said Gideon Oliver, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \"Judged by that yardstick, this is a huge victory,\" Oliver said. \"But whether or not it changes police practices is another story, and depends on how New Yorkers - and the city government - react.\n\n\"We can't let the police count this win for protesters as just another cost of doing business,\" he said, \"as they have so many times in the past.\"\n\nThe settlement comes four months after another major settlement between the city and Floyd protesters in March that paid a record $7 million to more than 300 people. In both cases, forensic reconstruction of the events played a key role in winning the settlements. Several other major cities have paid out large settlements to protesters in recent lawsuits aided by forensic reconstruction.\n\nBetween late May and early June 2020, at the height of the movement for racial justice sparked by Floyd's killing, protesters advocating against police misconduct were met with extreme forms of police abuse. \"Thousands exercised their constitutional rights to protest and were met with violence and indiscriminate arrests by the NYPD,\" the plaintiffs said in a Thursday press release.\n\n\"It's great when we can use technology to our benefit because we know it's been used against us so often,\" Savitri Durkee, a plaintiff in the suit, told The Intercept. \"Unfortunately, we can't just rely on sunshine and the public interest to see what's going on.\"\n\nShe added, \"We can see repeatedly, city after city, situation after situation, that the police are strategically, systematically violating our civil rights.\"\n\nPlaintiffs in the case noted that police had responded to other protests, including \"Blue Lives Matter\" and pro-police demonstrations, without using the force displayed against racial justice protesters. \"In other words, it is the message of the protest that determines whether Defendants will respond with violent tactics and indiscriminate mass arrests,\" the plaintiffs wrote in their suit.\n\nShortly after the suit was filed in 2021, the city moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the protests had passed and that the city had already made changes at the NYPD and implemented other reforms recommended in the wake of the protests. In July 2021 , a judge dismissed parts of the complaint that singled out city officials but granted others, allowing the case to move forward.\n\nThe suit relied on thousands of videos from more than 80 locations, including footage from police body cameras and helicopter surveillance. The deluge of video was sorted, analyzed, and reconstructed by SITU Research, a group that does visual investigations related to injustices and civil liberties. SITU Research has worked on a handful of recent cases that relied on forensic reconstruction and resulted in major settlements for protesters.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nWhile settlements for class action plaintiffs in cases of police brutality have been common throughout recent history, more recent settlements paid to protesters have broken state and national records. The growing size and frequency of settlements has drawn attention to the financial burden that police misconduct places on public coffers.\n\nThe shift, however, is unlikely to have a major impact on police conduct without broader institutional changes to policing, said Brad Samuels, director at SITU Research.\n\n\"While this settlement and the amounts paid to protesters does represent an important form of redress, our larger goal remains enduring change in policing - not just in New York City but across the United States,\" Samuels said. \"One thing I am certain of is that surveillance alone, whether in the hands of the state or its citizenry, will not be the agent of meaningful change. While it was clearly impactful to have ample video documentation in this case, we need to continually and critically assess how we are using these tools and to what ends. I am convinced there is much more that can be done.\"\n\nFor the protesters behind the suit, the payout was a welcome first step but left much work to be done to address police misconduct and shore up the right to protest.\n\n\"This doesn't begin to address the injustice. It just gives us a little bit more leeway to address the injustice,\" said Durkee, the plaintiff. \"The problem we are protesting stands. It is exactly how it was three years ago. All this settlement does is thaw a little bit the chill that has lain over the protest movement since.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "NYPD \"Goon Squad\" Manual Teaches Officers to Violate Protesters' Rights\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nExclusive: Internal NYPD documents shed new light on the Strategic Response Group, or SRG, the heavily militarized police unit behind the crackdown on George Floyd protesters.\n\nWhen thousands of New Yorkers poured into the city's streets last summer following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, they were met with the very police violence they had come to protest.\n\nIn the days following Floyd's death, and then again during protests last fall, New York police arrested hundreds of people, many with no probable cause. They pepper-sprayed protesters and struck them with batons, trapped them in the streets with no way out, pushed them to the ground, and shoved them with bikes. In Brooklyn, on May 30, an officer pulled down a man's Covid-19 mask and pepper-sprayed him at close range, bragging about it to fellow officers but failing to provide the man with medical assistance, as required by police regulations. Days later, another officer in Brooklyn struck a protester in the back of his head while he was complying with orders to disperse, causing a gash that required 10 staples. And in the Bronx, on June 4 , police in riot gear corralled hundreds of people before an 8 p.m. curfew, then beat and arrested them under the watch of the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer, Chief of Department Terence Monahan.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOver multiple incidents, police regularly and unjustifiably used force against peaceful protesters, with state investigators finding that they beat people with blunt instruments at least 50 times, unlawfully pepper-sprayed them in at least 30 instances, and pushed or struck protesters at least 75 times. Officers targeted and retaliated against people engaging in constitutionally protected activity, New York Attorney General Letitia James's office concluded , and \"blatantly violated the rights of New Yorkers.\"\n\nNYPD Strategic Response Group officers chase after protesters in the rain during demonstrations in Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer on June 3, 2020, in New York.\n\nLeading the violent crackdown was the New York Police Department's Strategic Response Group, or SRG, a heavily militarized, rapid-response unit of several hundred officers. Since its founding in 2015 to deal with public disorder events and terrorist acts, civil rights advocates have objected to the deployment of the unit to protests, and then-NYPD chief of department and later Commissioner James O'Neill pledged at the time that the SRG would \"not be involved in handling protests and demonstrations.\"\n\nThe pledge turned out to be hollow. That same year, the SRG was deployed against Black Lives Matter protesters. Since then, the unit's armor-clad officers and bike squads have become a regular presence at protests, where they stand out for their confrontational and aggressive tactics. After each confrontation, complaints about the unit streamed into the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the independent body tasked with reviewing allegations of police abuse. Investigators found a disproportionate number of SRG officers accused of wrongdoing to have exceeded their legal authority, when compared with the wider department. The group earned a reputation among activists as the NYPD's \" goon squad .\"\n\nDespite its visibility, little is publicly known about the SRG and how its specialized officers are trained to respond to protests. Even the frequently cited number of 700 SRG officers is an estimate; the NYPD will not confirm the unit's headcount.\n\nNow a series of internal documents obtained by The Intercept shed new light on the police unit behind some of the most brutal repression of protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing. The Intercept is publishing three of the public records with this story, including the SRG's guidelines and manuals for its field force operations and bike squads .\n\nThe documents offer a comprehensive overview of how the SRG operates. They outline the unit's responsibilities during routine assignments to precincts across the city, to which its officers are dispatched in response to spikes in crime and during special mobilizations, including to protests. The documents provide instructions regarding \"mass arrest\" procedures, guidelines for officers equipped with Colt M4 rifles, and directions for plainclothes, \"counter-surveillance\" officers tasked with shadowing tactical teams in the field.\n\nMarked as \"law enforcement sensitive\" and bearing destruction notices, the documents also detail a variety of formations and maneuvers for bike squads and teams of officers on foot and in vehicles. Some of the maneuvers described in detail are variations of what the NYPD refers to as \"encirclement,\" the police's name for what demonstrators call \"kettling,\" a technique civil rights advocates have long denounced as leading to police abuses.\n\nOver the last months, a series of scathing reports by independent agencies condemned the NYPD's response to the protests. The reports, which underscored the department's lack of preparedness and officers' poor training, contributed to a narrative that has become frequent in the wake of police abuses: that officers would have better handled such situations with better training - and thus more resources.\n\nThat narrative is complicated by the internal documents reviewed by The Intercept. Many of the policies laid out in the documents were not followed last summer or during more recent police crackdowns on protests. But the documents also raise questions about the content of police training on protest response itself. While paying lip service to protesters' constitutional rights, the documents do little to explain how those rights should be protected, offering instead page after page of instructions on how to circumvent them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NYPD defended the SRG's training, which he said includes a specialized SRG Academy as well as an annual, two-day course and eight monthly, two-hour unannounced drills. Members of the SRG Bicycle Squad participate in an annual two-day refresher course, he added. In August 2020 the department expanded training on the policing of protest to all members of the service.\n\n\"The NYPD protects the Constitutional right to peaceful protest, and works to ensure public safety for any New Yorker exercising their First Amendment rights,\" the spokesperson, Sergeant Edward D. Riley, wrote in a statement to The Intercept. \"Many different units of the NYPD respond to major events - including protests - to ensure the safety of the public at these events.\"\n\nThe NYPD documents include several drawings of tactical maneuvers as well as photos taken during police training and real-life protests, including some featuring prominent activists like Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, and Jose LaSalle. Overall, the SRG materials reflect a heavy-handed approach to the policing of protest and echo the war-on-terror mentality on which the unit was premised, at one point referring to protesters as potential \"hostile targets.\"\n\nJoo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, a coalition of community organizations, argued that the problem with the NYPD's response to the protests was not so much a matter of preparedness as of culture.\n\n\"Training is the easiest thing for elected officials to call for every time there is a controversy around police violence,\" she said. \"That has historically never worked to actually decrease police violence, or increase the firings of officers who violate people, or increase accountability.\"\n\nNYPD Strategic Response Group officers stand in formation as demonstrators hold a rally in Times Square denouncing racism in law enforcement and the May 25 killing of George Floyd on June 1, 2020, in New York.\n\nThe NYPD documents, which detail a clear chain of command in protest situations, also underscore how top department leadership, rather than rogue cops, bears responsibility for police actions during the protests, including the decisions to \"kettle\" people and resort to mass arrests. The Civilian Complaint Review Board received more than 300 allegations of police abuse in connection to the protests, and dozens of New Yorkers offered hours of harrowing public testimony about police brutality.\n\nThe incidents are now at the heart of a series of federal lawsuits against the city, including one by the New York a ttorney genera l . Nearly 450 people have also indicated their plans to sue the city individually over their treatment at the hands of police, suits that are expected to cost taxpayers millions in settlements.\n\nThe lawsuits zero in on abuses by SRG officers. In one, attorneys seeking to represent hundreds of protesters accuse the city of \"deploying one particularly problematic, inadequately trained, poorly supervised and disciplined group of NYPD members: the NYPD's Strategic Response Group.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"SRG officers are not only inadequately trained to respond to peaceful protests,\" the attorney general's office echoed in its own complaint, \"but their training in terrorism response, which necessarily requires aggressive tactics and extreme force, is almost certain to result in constitutional violations when applied to peaceful protesters.\"\n\nCritics of systemic police abuses noted that in seeking reforms to police's protest responses, the lawsuits risk the pitfalls of previous, similar efforts that followed high-profile crackdowns on dissent and led to little substantial change.\n\n\"There's no justice in it, there's no real improvement,\" said Alex Vitale, a sociology professor and the author of \"The End of Policing,\" who was involved in some of those earlier efforts. \"It's really hard to say that things really got any better as a result of that. They just work around it, or they just ignore it.\"\n\nThe SRG was conceived by Mayor Bill de Blasio's first NYPD commissioner, Bill Bratton, as an elite unit to deal with both \"counterterror\" and civil disorder. Originally approved in 2015 as a 350-officer unit, the SRG included teams in each borough and incorporated the Disorder Control Unit, or DCU, which had been central to aggressive crackdowns on mass protests in the past. The DCU had been instrumental in policing large events like Occupy Wall Street and protests surrounding the 2004 Republican National Convention, which resulted in massive numbers of arrests and alleged abuses. The crackdown on the 2004 protests led to record legal settlements , which observers say could be surpassed by suits surrounding last summer's uprising.\n\nWithin a year of its founding, a controversial push to expand the NYPD's head count by 1,300 officers ended up doubling the size of the SRG. Its budget quickly ballooned from $13 million to nearly $90 million. Equipped with state-of-the-art anti-riot gear and heavy weaponry, as well as its signature fleet of bicycles and combat armor-clad riders, the SRG, a voluntary unit, attracted cops looking for \" more action ,\" many with lengthy misconduct records . Since 2015, SRG officers have met peaceful protests with violence , failed to intervene as far-right activists assaulted counterprotesters, and participated in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man.\n\nDespite initial reassurances to the contrary, the SRG ended up policing protests far more than it did any \"counterterrorism\" work - already the job of the NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau - but it brought its militarized mentality and tactics to the policing of civil unrest. The SRG engaged in what the unit's guidelines refer to as \"high visibility static deployment,\" a show of force intended to \"provide and enhance visibility at sensitive or other locations.\" The unit dispatched officers donning military-style gas masks, ready for the \"hazards of a weapons of mass destruction event\" thanks to training in Chemical Ordinance, Biological and Radiological Awareness, or COBRA .\n\nOrganizers like Kang, of Communities United for Police Reform, opposed the formation of the SRG in its early days, not least because of the group's conflation of protest with terrorism. That the SRG was quickly deployed to protests, despite assurances that it would not be, was to Kang emblematic of \"the NYPD being able to unilaterally do whatever it wants, at any time that it wants.\" Kang noted that the department faced no pushback from the administration over its broken promise and added that the City Council did not hold a hearing about the SRG until a public uproar over its role in the arrest of immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir by federal immigration agents in 2018.\n\nUltimately, Kang said, the SRG's abuses reflected broader issues with the NYPD as a whole.\n\n\"The SRG is a symbol of the hyper-aggressive, militarized, unaccountable police violence in New York City, but that's not exclusive to the SRG,\" she said. \"We have to understand this is part of the fabric of how the NYPD has historically treated protests and has historically treated Black, Latinx, and other communities of color.\"\n\nDemonstrators calling for justice for George Floyd and NYPD Strategic Response Group officers are seen during a protest at Barclays Center in New York on May 29, 2020.\n\nAccording to the NYPD documents, one of the SRG's core missions is to \"respond to citywide mobilizations, civil disorders and major events with highly trained personnel and specialized equipment to maintain public order.\" The documents lay out procedures for dealing with emergencies, to which the SRG can respond by answering calls over citywide radio.\n\nUnlike with emergency calls, the SRG often has advance notice and time to prepare for protests. As soon as a detail is approved, an SRG field intelligence officer begins compiling a package of information on the situation for distribution to the SRG executive staff and commanding officer. According to the SRG documents, the intelligence packets include information such as the group size, planned arrests, key members of the protest group, and the group's hierarchy. Based on the intelligence, SRG executives make tactical decisions and supervisors debrief officers on the response plan, including the \"past history of this event or others involving this location or organization.\" Other SRG documents repeatedly refer to the unit's reliance on intelligence and the monitoring of social media.\n\nWhen the SRG arrives at a protest, it plays a supporting role in the NYPD ecosystem. SRG officers report to the local commander in charge, who has the authority to order arrests. Before such an order, according to the documents, SRG officers are instructed to follow directions and not to exercise discretion. They may make arrests unilaterally if they witness any felony or serious misdemeanor, such as vandalism, reckless endangerment, possession of a weapon, or assault. But the decision to engage in mass arrests of protesters for nonviolent behavior like unlawful assembly or \"obstructing governmental administration,\" the most frequent protest-related charges, rests squarely with department leadership.\n\nAs the NYPD's premier riot breakers, SRG units come heavily equipped, ready to make a show of overwhelming force against demonstrators. When a show of force fails, the SRG has a catalog of formations designed to break up protests. According to the SRG documents, these range from the basics, such as the \"Wedge Formation,\" used to split a crowd in half, to the more advanced, such as the \"Separation Formation,\" used to get between two dueling factions of protesters and push them apart.\n\nOne of the maneuvers best known to protesters is the \"Encirclement Formation,\" which is used \"when there is a need to take a group of people into custody,\" according to the guidelines. Commonly known as \"kettling,\" the formation allows police to surround protesters, leaving them no means of escape. Encirclement formations can be as small as one squad of eight officers or as large an entire platoon of four squads. In either case, the move to encircle protesters indicates that the decision to arrest has already been made, the document notes, and that the targets have been chosen.\n\nOn paper, the SRG's formations may seem well organized, but in practice, their execution is violent and chaotic. At a September demonstration in Times Square, SRG officers encircled a group of people protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including several on bikes, before they had even started moving, a protester who took several videos of police that day told The Intercept.\n\n\"The moment the bikes lined up on the street, the NYPD just immediately rushed over, started grabbing people by their hair, like five or six officers per person, throwing people to the ground, arresting all the bicyclists,\" he said. \"The protest hadn't even really started yet.\"\n\nNYPD Strategic Response Group officers arrest anti-Trump protesters in New York on Oct. 21, 2020.\n\nThe SRG takes considerable pride in its bike fleet and deploys it frequently to protests. Rather than tamping down disorder, the SRG's interventions have sowed chaos amid largely peaceful demonstrations.\n\nThe training material repeats department lore about the founding of New York's very first \"Scorcher Squad\" fleet of bicycle cops by Theodore Roosevelt when he was police commissioner in 1895. Today's SRG bike squad is modeled after the Seattle Police Department, and some of the early SRG bicyclists received training in Washington.\n\nThe bike squad's high maneuverability is perhaps the SRG's most important tactical innovation and the only function of the SRG that is not redundant with previously existing NYPD units. The bike squad has the capability to speed ahead of protest marches, and the SRG documents instruct bike officers to report real-time protest intelligence back to command, such as overheard plans, identities of \"aggressors\" and \"ringleaders,\" presence of improvised weapons, and injuries. The bike units can also move ahead to flank protests, selectively blocking streets to dictate the path of an oncoming march.\n\nNYPD training documents say that in close quarters, the bicycle represents a \"force multiplier\": One cop on a bicycle can take the place of three officers with batons. In addition to bike versions of on-foot formations, the bike squad has its own moves, such as the \"power slide\" and the \"dynamic dismount,\" which consist of an officer lunging from a moving bicycle without breaking speed, taking down a suspect by surprise.\n\n\"Get bicycle up to a controlled rate of speed and aim for target. While in attack position, swing right leg over the rear of bicycle,\" an SRG bike squad training module states, \"After step through, place right foot on ground and dismount bicycle ... make contact with subject and proceed with arrest or rescue.\"\n\nNYPD Strategic Response Group officers stand with bicycles at a protest in New York on Nov. 5, 2020.\n\nOne of the unit's highly visible tactics, the \"Mobile Fence Line,\" used to \"gain ground and compliance,\" employs SRG officers standing with their bikes across their chests, forming a line tire to tire. Shouting \"MOVE BACK!,\" the bicycle fence will advance aggressively over short distances. When a mobile fence line rakes across a protest area, it is because the police intend to make arrests, according to the SRG documents. One way this happens is with a maneuver called a BLAM.\n\nIn the \"Bike Line Arrest Maneuver,\" officers are instructed by the SRG documents to shout \"BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!\" as they advance. The documents outline the procedure for scooping people, right down to the \"clinch\" hold used to restrain them in emergency situations. \"Clinch maneuver is control of subjects head by clinching your hands and arms behind the head of subject and bringing head against your chest,\" the BLAM training module states, adding a warning: \"DO NOT CHOKE HOLD, DO NOT BLOCK AIRWAY.\"\n\nDuring the June 4 incident in the Bronx, SRG officers used bicycles as weapons in what Human Rights Watch later described as a \" planned assault \" on protesters. In public testimony to the attorney general's office, demonstrators described what happened when the SRG bike squad's mobile fence line advanced: \"The officer right in front of me gave a command, and they raised their bikes and rammed into me and all protesters in the front,\" testified Sami Disu, an adjunct professor at John Jay College, adding that he was also pepper-sprayed during the incident.\n\nOthers described being squeezed by the advance. Another protester arrested that night, Christina Ellsberg, described how the SRG trapped a group of protesters: \"They tightened their ranks and forced us together using their bikes and swinging batons until we were crushed and trampling each other,\" Ellsberg said in the testimony. \"At that point, panic set in. People were screaming, others struggling to breathe.\"\n\nAs the SRG's aggressive tactics against demonstrators came into stark display last summer, top city officials stood by the police. De Blasio repeatedly defended officers' conduct , and NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said, hours after police kettled and arrested dozens of protesters in the Bronx incident, that the action had been \"a plan which was executed nearly flawlessly.\"\n\nVirtually everyone else condemned the police's handling of the protests, with civil rights groups like the New York Civil Liberties Union and the public defenders of the Legal Aid Society denouncing police's \" indiscriminate brutalizing of peaceful protestors \" throughout the demonstrations.\n\nIn their joint lawsuit , NYCLU and Legal Aid are seeking damages for a dozen people who were beaten, pepper-sprayed, shoved to the ground, and arrested during several incidents last summer. The lawyers also want the police to declare that police violated the First and Fourth amendments.\n\nIn another class-action lawsuit , attorneys are seeking damages on behalf of a potentially enormous group of plaintiffs, including \"all people arrested between May 28 and June 6, as well as all people who have been or will be subjected to the NYPD's practices of violently disrupting protests.\"\n\nAnd in its own lawsuit , the New York State Office of the Attorney General has called on the courts to install an independent federal monitor to oversee the NYPD's policing tactics at future protests as well as a declaration that the tactics deployed last summer were unlawful. (A federal judge has temporarily combined these lawsuits.)\n\nAs his record on policing came under scrutiny during the protests more than at any time in his troubled tenure, de Blasio, in his last year in office, once again pledged reforms . \"I'm reflecting on what happened in May and June, and I look back with remorse,\" the mayor said last December.\n\nHe and Shea pledged to accept the recommendations of the city's Department of Investigation, which called for the NYPD to create a new protest response unit that does not report to the SRG and to \"reevaluate the central role of the Strategic Response Group and Disorder Control Unit in response to large protests given their orientation to handle counterterrorism, riots, and other serious threats, and better calibrate their use to circumstances that require such specialized force.\"\n\nOthers, like New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, have gone further. In a set of recommendations , Stringer, who is running for mayor, called for tactical police teams and heavily armed officers to be removed from protests altogether, replaced by a mostly civilian force tasked with managing the movement of people during large demonstrations. \"The SRG Disorder Control Unit should be disbanded,\" Stringer wrote.\n\nYet disbanding the SRG won't do much if its role and tactics end up repurposed under a new unit, critics warn, citing the SRG's roots in the DCU and the NYPD's long history of shutting down controversial units only to resurface them with rebranded names. Because the department operates with virtually no transparency, the public and even elected officials sometimes don't learn of internal changes or the shuffling of units and officers until months after these changes happened, said Kang.\n\n\"The SRG should be disbanded, yes,\" she added. \"But that in itself won't solve all the problems of what the SRG actually symbolizes: the hyper-militarization, the hyper-aggressive policing tactics. That's not an SRG problem only, that's an NYPD problem.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Congress Misses Symbolic Deadline for Police Reform\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden wanted a bill ready to sign by the anniversary of George Floyd's death. Advocates say Democrats didn't just miss the deadline - they missed the point.\n\nA year ago today, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for over nine minutes. Since then, Democrats in Congress have spoken out forcefully about the need to change policing in the U.S., and President Joe Biden declared on April 28 that he wanted a police reform bill passed by the anniversary of Floyd's death. But those efforts have largely fallen flat.\n\nThat Congress missed today's artificial deadline is not necessarily a surprise to organizers, who were frustrated that after so many overtures to the cause - including an embarrassing stunt in which members wearing traditional Ghanaian kente cloth kneeled on the floor of the Capitol - the House still passed a bill that gave millions of additional dollars to police. Biden, instead of signing a deal, will meet with Floyd's family for the first time in-person since his death. And even if Congress does pass a bill in the weeks or months that follow, some advocates are skeptical that it would fundamentally change the way police operate.\n\nIn March, the Justice in Policing Act passed the House on a 220-212 vote. Though the bill was all but guaranteed to die in the Senate, Democrats celebrated its unlikely prospects for enforcement. \"We're proud of this legislation, which will fundamentally transform the culture with bold, unprecedented reforms,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a press conference on the bill's passage.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBut to Scott Roberts, senior director of criminal justice campaigns at Color of Change, the pageantry was \"troubling.\" He told The Intercept that \"it feels like an effort to make [JPA] the end-all-be-all.\" After a jury convicted Chauvin of murder last month, congressional staffers told Axios there was a sense of relief in the Capitol that Chauvin's conviction alleviated pressure to pass a police reform package. Meanwhile, organizers renewed a push to further policies that prevent violent interactions with law enforcement in the first place, rather than simply trying to hold police accountable after they've already caused harm to someone, as was the aim of most congressional negotiations, Roberts said.\n\nOne such measure would be ending the transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement, one key provision of JPA that looks likely to survive in the Senate. Roberts stressed that activists might have more success pushing for similar changes in their local police departments, rather than waiting for change at the federal level.\n\n\"Part of our work is, frankly, trying to point people in other directions,\" he said. \"Where are those local interventions? Especially in places where Black communities have the power to move stuff. Where there's not a Joe Manchin and a Tim Scott standing in our way.\"\n\nSenate negotiations on police reform started breaking down on May 9, when House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., told CNN that Democrats should open their minds to passing a measure that did not end qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that protects police officers from civil suits.\n\nOver the past year, ending qualified immunity has often been framed as a marquee activist issue, but the concept has long had bipartisan support. Following backlash from some centrist members to protests against police brutality, Democrats have been skittish to support any measure that could be used to attack them later as anti-police, and many have leaned into the notion that the legal doctrine is untouchable. The likelihood that a measure to end or even limit the scope of qualified immunity will advance to the final package is growing smaller by the day as former Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass, D-Calif., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., try to hammer out a deal with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.\n\nAt the time of Clyburn's comments, several Democratic congressional staffers told The Intercept the majority whip was speaking for himself, was not at the negotiating table, and that his views did not represent the views of people leading negotiations. Scott, for one, had been open to a compromise on qualified immunity until Clyburn's comments made the rounds. By May 12, Scott told congressional reporters he was on \"the exact opposite side.\"\n\nSeveral progressives in the House have expressed frustration with this session's congressional efforts to develop meaningful police reform. Even the much-hailed JPA, they noted, was passed as something much different than what organizers pushing reforms at the height of protests last summer were actually calling for .\n\nWhen the House voted on JPA in March, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., negotiated with the House Judiciary Committee to hold a series of hearings on police reform in exchange for her voting \"yes\" on the bill. Pressley's demand came in response to frustration from organizers who saw that after so many speeches and promises to voters, Congress was only willing to go so far.\n\nOther groups, including the political arm of the Movement for Black Lives, pushed alternative measures and actively opposed JPA. The group helped develop an alternative proposal, the BREATHE Act , which would divest from law enforcement agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and reinvest funds from such agencies into social, health, and education programs. Pressley and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., endorsed the BREATHE Act last year, but the proposal never took off in Congress.\n\nGiven Democrats' razor-thin margin in the House, progressive members of the \"squad\" could potentially tank a bill that doesn't go far enough. Just last week, they considered such a move on a proposal to give an additional $1.9 billion to U.S. Capitol Police and for Capitol security. After negotiating with leadership up to the last minute, they split and allowed the vote to pass with three present (Tlaib, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.) and three no votes (Pressley, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.). It's unclear whether they'll be so forgiving when, and if, a police reform package ever returns to the House.\n\nOn Friday, 10 progressives led by Pressley and Bush sent a letter to congressional leadership expressing concerns with discussions about passing any police reform package that lacks a qualified immunity repeal. Tlaib; Omar; Ocasio-Cortez; Bowman; Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y.; Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.; Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., signed the letter.\n\nBowman told The Intercept it would be \"extremely difficult\" to support any police reform package that does not end qualified immunity. \"Leadership in the House, the Senate, and the White House have got to ensure that negotiations do not water the bill down ahead of final passage, that we save lives, and that the American people see the transformative change they have demanded,\" he said.\n\nJones agreed. \"To truly honor George Floyd's legacy, we must enact meaningful police reform that actually addresses systemic racism in policing,\" he told The Intercept. \"I cannot imagine myself voting for something that does not end qualified immunity, which is what is going to deter officers in a meaningful way from engaging in the misconduct that is on the public conscience.\"\n\nBush told CNN last month that she would not support a compromise on qualified immunity. \"I didn't come to Congress to compromise on what could keep us alive,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement, Watson Coleman said that keeping qualified immunity would be an insult to protesters and voters who helped elect Biden. \"Despite protests, demands, and elections, unarmed Black people continue to die at the hands of the police while qualified immunity continues to shield police from accountability and the culture of excessive force by the hands of law enforcement against Black and brown bodies persists,\" she said, adding that the removal of the provision \"would be an affront to those who marched and those who voted for change - effectively placing a bandage over a gaping wound.\"\n\nHer office said they couldn't say how she would vote on a changed police reform bill before seeing its final version.\n\nIn addition to a ban on qualified immunity, JPA policies that may not make it into a Senate bill include making it easier to federally prosecute officers who violate someone's civil rights and any meaningful cuts to federal law enforcement budgets. The latter piece was central to the failed BREATHE Act.\n\nSeveral measures that are unlikely to have much impact on policing have a stronger chance of approval from Senate negotiators. These include mitigation efforts that are already in place in many cities, like implicit bias training, bans on chokeholds, and body cameras. Organizers point out that such mechanisms don't decrease the number of interactions people have with police, which is a key part of addressing the root causes of police brutality and, in many cases, don't actually end the use of banned tactics. In New York, for example, where police banned chokeholds in 1993, Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner with a chokehold in 2014. The state assembly passed a bill banning chokeholds, named after Garner, in 2020.\n\nEven so, mainstream media has covered congressional efforts thus far on police reform as the pinnacle of legislative activity on the topic: as \" the most ambitious police reform effort in decades ,\" as \" police-overhaul \" legislation, and as something \" that would change the way policing works in America .\" While it's true that JPA was one of the most significant congressional efforts to address police brutality in decades, that's only because there wasn't much to compare it to before.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Mark Esper Waited Two Years to Tell Us Trump Wanted Troops to Shoot George Floyd Protesters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe former defense secretary is not the first Trump aide to save damning information for a memoir, but Esper knew Trump wanted an American Tiananmen and still kept quiet.\n\nAccording to former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, on June 1, 2020, a week after the murder of George Floyd, then-President Donald Trump asked him to deploy 10,000 active-duty troops to the streets of the nation's capital and have them open fire on protesters. \"Can't you just shoot them?\" Trump asked, in an Oval Office meeting Esper describes in the introduction to his new memoir. \"Just shoot them in the legs or something?\"\n\nEsper, who waited nearly two years to reveal that an American president had urged him to launch a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on dissent, is well aware that Trump's plan was both illegal and immoral. That's clear because his account of this \"surreal\" request is included not just in the introduction to his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" but also featured on back cover of the book, due to be published next week.\n\nThe cover of former Defense Secretary Mark Esper's memoir.\n\nBut instead of immediately resigning and letting the American people know that their president was a danger to the republic, here is what Esper did that day: He tried to placate Trump and then joined the president in posing for photographs outside St. John's Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House, after federal agents had used chemical irritants and force to violently disperse peaceful protesters from the square.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nA month later, when Esper was called before the House Armed Services Committee to explain how the military had been used to suppress dissent that day - and that night, when Black Hawk and Lakota helicopters swooped low over protesters in Washington, D.C., using winds from the rotor wash to instill terror - the defense secretary made no mention of Trump's request to use potentially deadly force.\n\nIn that hearing , Rep. Adam Smith, the Democratic chair of the House Armed Services Committee, asked Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to describe \"what sort of conversations went on between the Department of Defense and the president and others in the White House\" about Trump's public threat to use active-duty soldiers to clear the streets.\n\nInstead of answering that question, Esper offered bland assurances that the military, including 43,000 Army and Air National Guard personnel deployed in 33 states and the District of Columbia during \"the civil unrest\" after Floyd's murder, was committed to \"remaining apolitical\" and ensuring that \"our fellow Americans have the ability to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr and Defense Secretary Mark Esper inspect the work of federal security forces in Washington, D.C., on June 1, 2020.\n\nEsper - who said last year that he was writing his book because the \"American people deserve a full and unvarnished accounting of our nation's history, especially the more difficult periods\" - told the New York Times this week that he had concluded that Trump \"is an unprincipled person who, given his self-interest, should not be in the position of public service.\"\n\nGiven that his firsthand experience of Trump led him to this view, it is important to ask why Esper chose not to reveal that the president he served had wanted to turn the military on the people when it might have made a real difference - either before the 2020 election, when it might have dented Trump's chances of winning, or just after it, when Trump fired him and put loyalists in charge of the Pentagon before urging his own supporters to disrupt the certification of his loss.\n\nAnd here, it must be said, there appears to be something even more troubling at work than just the fact that Esper might expect to sell more copies of his book by waiting to reveal the most damaging information about Trump - as former Trump aides John Bolton and Stephanie Grisham did before him.\n\nWhat I'm thinking of is a disturbing deference to presidential authority that seems deeply rooted in Washington. There was clear evidence of that in something else that Smith said to Esper and Milley at the start of the July 9, 2020, hearing on the events of June 1 that year.\n\nBefore asking the top officials in the Pentagon to explain what role the military had been asked to play in the abusive policing of the racial justice protests, Smith told them that he was aware of \"the difficult position that any secretary of defense and any chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in. You work for the president. He's commander-in-chief.\"\n\nBut given the gravity of what Esper knew about Trump's desire to see American troops open fire on peaceful protesters, what he chose to conceal from Congress and the public is far more grave than the sort of policy disagreement that Smith described as routine.\n\nAnd while other senior officials - including Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, his first secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, and his former chief of staff, John Kelly - let their dim views of the former president's character and intellect trickle out through leaks to reporters like Bob Woodward, Esper sat on explosive evidence about Trump's willingness to unleash a form of martial law even after he refused to accept the results of the 2020 election.\n\nLooking at Esper's silence until after Trump was out of office, we are left with a very strange definition of what it means to be a public servant - one who cannot be expected to tell the public that the president would have them shot.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "The George Floyd Killing in Minneapolis Exposes the Failures of Police Reform\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs protests engulf Minneapolis after yet another police killing, advocates across the country say the time for police reform is over.\n\nAs protests over the police killing of George Floyd engulfed Minneapolis for a third night on Thursday, and solidarity protests broke out in cities across the country, there was both a sense that the country had been through this before - too many times - and that the stakes had begun to shift.\n\nIn the Twin Cities, where Floyd's killing at the hands of officer Derek Chauvin was just the latest in a series of high-profile police killings in the last five years, those who took to the streets in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic were tired and exasperated. Years of misconduct and brutality by local police had brought many protests and much talk of reform. But Floyd's death was an urgent reminder that here, as across the country, police reform had failed, and that the time had come for something different.\n\n\"They call for training, but are they doing the training, and is the training being internalized?\" said Moriah Stephens, a special education teacher, as she stood near a highway overpass in St. Louis Park, the suburb where Floyd had lived, waving as passing cars honked in support. \"I can tell you 50 times over that my life matters and I would like you to speak out about the fact that my life matters , and you can hear me say that 50 times, but are you going to do it?\"\n\n\"I'm tired of being angry, and I'm tired of being tired, and I'm tired of seeing new hashtags,\" she added, referring to a recent wave of police killings and other racist incidents across the country. \"I'm lucky I'm alive. I can stand here. I can shout. There's part of me that's like, I need to use what I have - I have my life and I need to use it, but I'm also tired of doing that.\"\n\nStephens, who had joined protests after the police killings of Philando Castile in a Minneapolis suburb in 2016, said her father was currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. She was reluctant to go out in the middle of a Covid-19 outbreak that had already taken nearly 1,000 lives in Minnesota, and like many protesters was wearing a mask and standing at a distance from others . \"I'm not supposed to be around people.

They said \"I can't breathe\" - George Floyd's last words as Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than seven minutes, but also the last words of Eric Garner, who was killed six years ago by a New York police officer, igniting a movement against police violence of which Floyd's death is just the latest chapter. After Garner's death, as after the death of Michael Brown the same year in Ferguson, Missouri, and those of scores of other black men and women killed by police since then, protesters called for the officers to be held accountable. But there were new calls at Thursday's protests - such as \"Fund Community Not Police\" - that tapped into a more recent and growing movement demanding not so much police reform and accountability as abolition, through the defunding of police departments.\n\n\"In the wake of George Floyd's murder by MPD officer Derek Chauvin, and the Minneapolis Police Department's escalated violence against the city's grieving Black community, Minneapolis is in desperate need of visionary leadership,\" the Minneapolis group Reclaim the Block wrote in a statement calling on the city council to defund the police department. \"Now is the time to invest in a safe, liberated future for our city. We can't afford to keep funding MPD's attacks on Black lives.\"\n\nThere were signs some local leaders were starting to see it the same way. Under pressure from students, the University of Minnesota announced this week that it would scale back its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department. The University of Minnesota was the first public institution to cut ties with MPD after the killing of George Floyd. On Friday afternoon, Minneapolis public schools board members issued a resolution to terminate the school district's contract with the Minneapolis Police Department. And protesters called for more action to curtail the role of police altogether.\n\n\"The system is not broken. It's doing exactly what it was designed to do ; that's what people need to wrap their heads around,\" said Imani Jackson, who grew up in St. Louis Park . \"We need to create an entire new one.\"\n\nIn the hours immediately after Floyd's death, it was clear that the national conversation around police violence, set in motion by the killings of Brown and Garner in 2014, had finally begun to change. Chauvin, as well as three officers who had stood by without intervening as he killed Floyd, were promptly fired. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who took the helm of the department three years ago following backlash over another police killing, called for an FBI investigation. Mayor Jacob Frey called for the officers to be charged. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter - a charge that means the officer had no intent to kill and left some protesters disappointed.\n\n\"People weren't having it no more,\" said Sam Martinez, an organizer with the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar. \"The system knew that.\"\n\nA number of law enforcement and elected officials across the country also quickly denounced the Minneapolis officers' actions - public criticism that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.\n\nIn New York City, where Floyd's death carried echoes of Eric Garner's and where at least 72 protesters were arrested last night in a solidarity demonstration, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea and Mayor Bill de Blasio took to Twitter to condemn Floyd's killing. \"What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,\" tweeted Shea. \"This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.\" \"I am horrified,\" tweeted de Blasio. \"George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight and the man who killed him was a police officer.\"\n\nDe Blasio's and Shea's comments stood in stark contrast with their defense of Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who killed Garner. Pantaleo was fired last summer , five years after Garner's death.\n\n\"It took him five years to take any action in the Eric Garner case, and now he wants immediate action in Minneapolis,\" said Alex Vitale, who runs the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, echoing widespread criticism of de Blasio's statement.\n\nEven the National Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the country and a staunch defender of officers involved in killings of unarmed people in the past, released a statement criticizing the Minneapolis officers' actions. \"Based on the by-stander's video from this incident, we witnessed a man in distress pleading for help,\" the group wrote in a statement that was soon echoed by many local chapters of the union. \"There is no doubt that this incident has diminished the trust and respect our communities have for the men and women of law enforcement.\"\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey fired four police officers following the killing of George Floyd in their custody.\n\nBut critics warned that the public condemnations, including by law enforcement, were more a matter of political expediency than anything else. \"I think that is politically convenient for all of them,\" said Kandace Montgomery, director of Black Visions Collective, a Minnesota-based racial justice group, which is affiliated with Reclaim the Block and the Movement for Black Lives. \"Until they actually offer real solutions and offer real policies that address the inherent violence of police departments, it's all talk.\"\n\n\"That's all well and good, but it means nothing to me until they actually start making concrete changes in how they do business in their police department,\" echoed Neill Franklin, a retired police major and the executive director of the Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Franklin pointed to the long history of complaints of abuse and excessive force filed against the officers responsible for Floyd's death - and to the fact that reports of police misconduct, nationwide, are kept from public view largely because of union contracts that protect officers no matter their conduct.\n\n\"There are police chiefs who are now voicing their disgust about what happened in Minneapolis. Well, how about you now move to make these personnel records public?\" said Franklin. \"If you really are concerned as a police leader in what's happening, not just with Mr. Floyd, but case after case, rework the union contracts. ... We need to change these laws so that we have the ability to take swift action.\"\n\nBut while calling for greater transparency - including a national database tracking officers terminated for misconduct so they wouldn't just move from department to department - Franklin acknowledged efforts to reform police had largely fallen short.\n\n\"Reform is not the answer, we've been trying it for decades, and as you can see, we're just not getting anywhere,\" he said. \"We need a new paradigm of policing in the United States. It needs to be completely dismantled and reconstructed, not changing a policy here or there.\"\n\n\"We are still working with a model of policing in this country that was born out of slavery in this country, that was born out of a white supremacy in this country,\" he added. \"That's why reform won't work and that's why we haven't made any traction whatsoever on this issue of race, as we've seen with the death of Mr. Floyd.\"\n\nIn fact, the swift condemnation of the Minneapolis officers was largely a testament to the deep crisis policing has been facing for years. That crisis was only exacerbated by the current health and economic emergency, which has left communities reeling and feeling that their government, across institutions, has failed them in unprecedented ways.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"Police have realized that their basic legitimacy is being challenged here, and they had better figure out some way to get out from under this,\" said Vitale, who wrote a book that has both anticipated and informed the growing national movement to defund police. \"So if that means throwing a few individual officers under the bus, they are happy to do that.\"\n\nThe reluctance of prosecutors to charge the officers responsible for Floyd's killing was yet another sign of how little has changed. \"There is other evidence that doesn't support a criminal charge,\" said County Attorney Mike Freeman, who compared Floyd's death to that of Freddie Gray, who died in the custody of Baltimore police in 2015 - a rare case in which the officers involved were charged with murder 12 days after the incident. That prosecution was ultimately unsuccessful. \"It was a rush to charge, it was a rush to justice,\" Freeman said of Gray's case, despite the fact that Floyd's death, unlike Gray's, was clearly caught on camera.\n\n\"When it's the average citizen who gets arrested and charged for something, the arrest is made immediately as soon as you have probable cause for an arrest,\" noted Franklin, the retired cop.\n\nIn Ferguson, the top prosecutor's refusal to charge officer Darren Wilson in 2014 led to weeks of protests as a grand jury sifted through evidence in the case before declining to bring charges. In Minneapolis, it took three days of protests for Chauvin to be arrested and charged. Some protesters set several buildings on fire, including the Third Precinct headquarters, where Chauvin worked.  And as they did after protests erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, police responded to protests of Floyd's death with tear gas and rubber bullets, at one point spraying tear gas out of a moving vehicle onto an apparently peaceful crowd. Several protesters, as well as some journalists , were arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilized the National Guard, and after Chauvin was arrested, Frey set an 8 p.m. curfew for the weekend. President Donald Trump, as Barack Obama did after Freddie Gray's killing in Baltimore, called protesters who looted stores \"thugs\" - though unlike Obama, Trump also called for them to be shot .\n\nIn fact, Michael Brown's death in Ferguson ushered in an era of police reform that saw federal and local governments invest heavily in police training, including on racial bias, and in technology like body cameras that officials promised would bring about accountability. Floyd's death was yet another reminder that those reforms have failed.\n\nPolice face off with demonstrators outside the police station as protests continue in the wake of the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown on Oct. 22, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.\n\n\"This is happening after five years of being told, 'Don't worry, we're getting the training,'\" said Vitale. \"The de-escalation training, the anti-bias training, the mindfulness training ... why aren't things getting any better?\"\n\nAs evidence mounts of the failures of police reform, some departments and unions are beginning to embrace calls for individual accountability for \"bad cops\" who they continue to insist are not representatives of their institutions as a whole. But while protesters continue to call for individual officers to be arrested and prosecuted, there is a growing recognition that police misconduct will continue, no matter how many reforms politicians enact, as long as policing exists at the present scale.\n\n\"They are desperate. They see that they've got a major credibility problem and that there are active campaigns to take their money away,\" said Vitale. \"This whole idea of jailing killer cops as a way to fix policing is completely naive and misguided. Even when they are convicted, as rare as that is, there's really no evidence that this feeds back into changes in how policing is done.\"\n\nReducing the size of police departments by curbing their resources, he and others argue, will be far more effective at reducing police violence than any costly effort to improve the police. \"These 'defund and fund alternatives' kinds of movement are much more threatening to police chiefs, which is why I think they are bending over backwards to try to get out ahead of this thing,\" said Vitale. \"People in the movement are shifting: They are not calling for body cameras and more training. More and more people are like, 'Fuck that, take their money away.'\"\n\nThe movement against police brutality took off in Minnesota after police killed Jamar Clark in 2015. The 24-year-old black man was shot in the head by a pair of officers who said they had acted in self-defense, a story some witnesses disputed. In the wake of his death, community members shut down Interstate 94 and occupied the 4th Precinct in North Minneapolis for more than two weeks. Despite intensive organizing by groups like the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, an internal investigation by the Minneapolis police department found that the two officers who killed Clark did not so much as violate a department policy.\n\nSince then, local movements have pushed for justice for the families of victim after victim of police violence in Minnesota. Among those killed was Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black motorist pulled over by St. Anthony police in the suburb of Falcon Heights in 2016, whose girlfriend began livestreaming after an officer shot him as Castile reached for his wallet. In 2017, Justine Ruszczyk, also known as Justine Damond, a 40-year-old white woman, was approaching a Minneapolis police car to report a potential sexual assault when a startled police officer shot and killed her. And in 2018, body camera footage revealed Minneapolis police chasing Thurman Blevins, a 31-year-old black man who they said was carrying a gun, and shooting him to death. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Castile, was acquitted, and prosecutors declined to file charges against the officers who killed Blevins. Mohamed Noor, who killed Ruszczyk, was sentenced to 12 years in prison - a sentence that some felt only came because Ruszczyk was white and Noor is black. Her family was awarded a record $20 million settlement.\n\nA niece of Jamar Clark protested with a photograph of the two Minneapolis police officers who were involved in Clark's murder on Oct. 15, 2016, in Minneapolis.\n\nAt least a dozen police reform bills have failed to make meaningful progress in the state legislature since 2015. The most recent effort began last July, with the appointment of a task force that included police as well as anti-police-brutality organizers. After a series of public hearings, the group released a list of 28 proposals for reform in February, including creating a specialized unit in the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for investigating instances of deadly force. Then Covid-19 hit, and the follow-up actions required by the state legislature stalled.\n\nOn the heels of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson and of a series of other high-profile police killings, in 2014 Minneapolis became one of six cities to pilot the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice - a multimillion-dollar program that was the Obama administration's response to the national call for police accountability. The initiative, widely replicated in police departments across the country, promoted a \"community based\" approach to policing in response to criticism of so-called broken windows policing and New York-style stop-and-frisk.\n\n\"The whole idea was that if police had implicit bias training, so more money for training police, and were using technology for more accountability, and that if police officers were more respectful when they're interacting with the community, that that will promote a better idea of policing, and more cooperation with police,\" said Nancy Heitzeg, a sociology professor at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, who has studied the initiative.\n\n\"That was the theory,\" she said. \"And what does it say about the limits of reform that the city of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis police department could be part of a multi-year, multimillion-dollar national project to enhance police community relations, and after all of that, here we are?\"\n\nAfter years of investment in improved policing with no results to show for it, \"the conversation has changed,\" she added. \"There's much more of a public awareness and conversation about abolition, and what that means and what that might look like. ... I think people were radicalized by Jamar Clark and Philando Castile. And then they saw the contradictions around Justine Damond.\"\n\nMontgomery, the director of Black Visions Collective, said that organizers are tired of just calling for prosecutions. \"We're moving past a conversation around prosecuting the police and individual officers - that doesn't change anything. It doesn't prevent another Philando Castile or George Floyd,\" said Montgomery. \"To me and many of my comrades, police reform is irrelevant.\"\n\nSome demands have shifted to community control. Organizer Sam Martinez told The Intercept that the Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar wants a board similar to a city council or school board to run the police: controlling its budget, approving union contracts, and deciding disciplinary actions. Martinez says the board would have to be fundamentally different from previous civilian police review councils that law enforcement has mostly ignored.\n\nFor his part, Mayor Jacob Frey, who critiqued police during an election campaign that took place in the aftermath of Ruszczyk's killing, increased the police budget last year by more than $8 million, part of an effort to put more officers on the street. He has called his brand of police reform \"community-oriented\" policing, where more officers would build stronger relationships with community members.\n\nMeanwhile, the local police union has maintained powerful sway over the fate of the mayor's tepid reform efforts. This summer, Frey banned police officers from participating in warrior-style trainings that promote an attitude that lethal threats to police are everywhere. Yanez, the officer who killed Castile, had participated in one such training. In response, Minneapolis police union head Bob Kroll, an avid Trump supporter, stated that the union would offer the training free to any officer who wanted it.\n\nMontgomery argues that defunding police is the only meaningful way forward. \"For too long we have invested a massive amount of money in an institution that continues to prove itself to be failing and to be inadequate to address the safety needs of our community,\" said Montgomery. \"Defunding is about allocating the abundance of resources we do have to things that have been proven to work\" - like housing, health, and education.\n\nOn Friday morning, organizers with Reclaim the Block delivered a petition to Minneapolis city council members, demanding that they agree to never again increase the police funding, cut the current budget by $45 million to help manage Covid-19 shortfalls, invest in community-led health and safety strategies, and work to compel the police department to stop inflicting violence on community members. The elected officials were given a deadline of 8 a.m. Saturday to respond.\n\n\"My greatest hope is that our city council, our mayor, folks across the country take this opportunity to look at solutions that actually keep us safe and away from the police,\" said Montgomery. \"My fear is that we will settle for something that looks like justice but won't change our future and won't guarantee that we won't have to be doing this in a couple of weeks or months or years.\"\n\nWAIT!

Asked by Nelson if she and the other witnesses were \"upset or angry,\" one witness, off-duty Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hansen, responded tersely : \"I don't know if you've seen anybody be killed, but it's upsetting.\" Hansen was rebuked by the judge for arguing with the lawyer, but her controlled fury resonated with many viewers of the televised trial.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe brazen nature of the murder and the video posted online sparked months of street protests against the police killings of Black people in more than 2,700 American cities and towns and in other nations.\n\n\"I would not call today's verdict justice,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said after the verdict, \"because justice implies true restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step towards justice.\"\n\nEllison, whose office led the prosecution, said the bystanders \"who stopped and raised their voices\" during the crime \"were a bouquet of humanity: old, young; men and women; Black and white; a man from the neighborhood just walking to get a drink; a child going to buy a snack with her cousin; an off-duty firefighter on her way to a community garden; brave young women - teenagers - who pressed record on their cellphones. ...

He was convicted on Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin will be sentenced in the weeks ahead and could face up to 40 years in prison but is likely to receive far less time because of his lack of a previous criminal record. Both murder charges carry a presumptive prison sentence of 12.5 years, but prosecutors have asked for more time.\n\nThe other fired officers - Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Lane - who were also arrested and charged within days of the crime, all face trial in August for having aided and abetted the second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd.\n\nIn advance of the verdict, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an assistant professor of African American studies at Princeton, wrote on Twitter that, no matter what the jury found, \"nothing has changed the underlying conditions allowing for the murder of Floyd in the first place.\" The recent police killings of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and Adam Toledo in Chicago , Taylor added, \"assure that without the annihilation of the criminal punishment system, we will be here again.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nAt times of widespread misery, a single incident of blatant injustice can cause enormous, unexpected outrage - outrage that then fuels far wider protests and more radical demands. This is exactly what we've seen across the United States since George Floyd's murder.\n\nDemonstrators hold up their arms during a protest sparked by the death of George Floyd while in police custody on May 29, 2020 in Oakland, California.\nJustin Sullivan / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen an already suffering, dispossessed, angry population pleads for justice and receives instead more repression and disrespect, things have a tendency to explode.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, France's King Louis XVI threatened to use the army to subdue unrest among diverse groups angry about his proposed land tax. This response backfired. Combined with widespread discontent and a famine, protests quickly went beyond anger at the tax and combusted into the French Revolution of 1789. Within a few years, the flames of Revolution swept away the Bourbon monarchy, and its king died on the guillotine.\n\nIn early 1917, the Russian tsar called in the army to quell protests of women and striking factory workers demanding bread, but this only inflamed hungry protesters and encouraged revolt across the country. By the end of 1918, Tsar Nicholas II was executed at the hands of the new Soviet government.\n\nThe last major US general strike hit Oakland in 1946 after police bussed in scabs to break a department store workers' picket. Amid high unemployment and inflation, Oakland truck drivers and streetcar operators, who were incensed by the state-sponsored strikebreaking, helped spread the strike throughout the city.\n\nWhen living conditions are bad enough for enough people, the government's response to protesters' reasonable demands, however local or limited those demands are, can cause enormous and unexpected outrage - outrage that then fuels far wider protests for far more radical demands. This is exactly what we have seen in the streets all across the United States since the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week.\n\nEven before Floyd's murder, millions of workers were suffering under the worst pandemic in a century. The police continued to kill black people with impunity. The super rich got ever richer: America's billionaires piled up an additional $434 billion just since the pandemic started, bringing their total wealth to over $3.3 trillion - more than the wealth of the bottom 60 percent of Americans combined. Our immigration system continued to be characterized by endless horrors. In retrospect, it should have been no surprise that rage simmering just beneath the surface over all of those issues and more has exploded once it was given a catalyst, in the form of a video of a blatant police murder by a white cop against an unarmed black man.\n\nAfter ten days of protests in over a hundred cities, protesters' demands have escalated. Those demands rightfully include an end to racist and militarized policing. We must also demand a worker-centered response to the Covid-19 health and economic crisis which is killing thousands. All these crises are connected to the crushing economic injustice of the social order that police are tasked with defending. To win, we must take that social order head on.\n\nAt first, outrage focused on indicting George Floyd's murderer, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, and his three accomplices. Chauvin was eventually charged with third-degree murder, which would mean that prosecutors believe Chauvin did not \"intend\" to kill Floyd despite the fact that Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and Floyd repeatedly choked out the words \"I can't breathe.\" That changed with yesterday's announcement that Chauvin would be charged with second-degree murder and the three other officers would also face charges. Yet it's clear that Chauvin should actually be charged with first-degree murder. And recent, similar police murders have still gone unpunished: Breonna Taylor's killers in the Louisville police department, who broke into the twenty-six-year-old health care worker's home and shot her eight times.\n\nFloyd is one of countless unarmed black Americans murdered in cold blood by police over the last decade. Some of these murders, especially when they are captured on cell phone videos and go viral, have incited nationwide protests. But the scale of the protests and the horrific degree of police repression against protesters since last week has led to more ambitious demands - most importantly, the demand to drastically reduce the bloated police budgets that funnel enormous amounts of resources to police brutality and incarceration rather than meeting human needs.\n\nOakland, where I live, spends 41 percent of its budget on policing while, even before coronavirus, thousands sleep on the street, public schools are criminally underfunded, and brown and black children in poor neighborhoods have lead poisoning rates worse than Flint, Michigan. Meanwhile, the police have been involved in countless killings and scandals, including participating in a multi-agency sex trafficking ring involving minors.\n\nOver the last fifty years, American cities have seen major budget cuts, unions have been decimated, workers have lost jobs and affordable housing, our essential infrastructure has crumbled, poverty and homelessness has skyrocketed. But city and state governments, with federal support, have turned to policing and prisons to violently control unemployed and poor people - especially black and brown people but whites, too - instead of providing jobs and resources to bring them out of poverty.\n\nMost cities now have an expensive and militarized police force that brutalizes poor people with impunity. Add to that the apparent right-wing radicalization of police across the country - who parrott Fox News conspiracy theories and think they are fighting a war against an armed left-wing militia - and we get the current reign of police terror in response to peaceful protests.\n\nWhile police are targeting black protesters with far more violence, their violence against white protesters, journalists, and random bystanders is a reminder, for whites who think the issue doesn't affect them, of Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor's warning : \"Far and away, African Americans suffer most from the blunt force trauma of the American criminal justice system, but the pervasive character of law-and-order politics means that whites get caught up in its web as well.\"\n\nSo it's good to see the demand in countless protest signs everywhere to \" defund the police.\" Cutting police budgets will actually reduce police power in the streets and in politics, unlike liberal procedural tweaks like the new #8Can'tWait campaign being promoted by DeRay McKesson, Oprah, and other celebrities.\n\nThe demand to defund is also a call to decriminalize poverty and reinvest our society's resources in humane and socially useful goods and services like schools, housing, health care, transportation, and renewable energy infrastructure. As the military and police mobilize a near nationwide shutdown with massive staging facilities and untold billions in equipment, viral comparisons of to nurses wearing trash bags make clear that our society has the material capacity, just not the political will, to deal with a pandemic in a compassionate and effective way.\n\nThe demand to defund the police and refund other services has the potential to unify a broader movement at this crucial moment. Activists fighting for all sorts of economic demands can clearly see how their success hinges on the success of the movement against racist police violence. Just this sort of unity at a national scale will be necessary to build on the energy from Bernie Sanders's two campaigns and a resuscitated labor movement in order to wage a united fight against police fascism and our government's inhumane COVID-19 response.\n\nWe should also be calling to tax the rich, especially billionaires like Jeff Bezos who has made $34 billion since March. Redistribution from the rich and the police to essential public goods is especially important given the looming budgetary crisis caused by the coronavirus recession. Activists can take up this demand by researching how much of their city's budget is spent on policing (including for police brutality lawsuits - Chicago spent $113 million on such lawsuits in 2018 alone) and supporting other public-sector unions in demanding that recession-driven cuts be taken out of the police budget, not much-needed social services.\n\nBloated police budgets are always a poison for American cities. But the recent spate of curfews, which police are using to clear the streets of vandals and peaceful protesters alike, should also be opposed vigorously. The Left has learned, as Alex Vitale put it , \"No true progressive movement can flourish in a police state.\"\n\nIn total, tens of millions of Americans are now under curfew for the first time in decades . While police and public officials from both parties claim these curfews are in the interest of preventing violence and property destruction, the main instigators of violence are very clearly the police themselves. By ceding our cities' streets to violent police and white vigilantes , politicians are not only throwing away our freedom to engage in public protest, but sanctioning unconstitutional terror and repression in the name of \"law and order.\" These curfews highlight the frightening extreme right-wing or even pro-fascist current in the United States, including cops raising the Thin Blue Line flag and President Trump himself.\n\nStill, the United States is not at this moment descending into actual fascism, and despite the brutality in the streets, much is happening that is actually quite heartening.\n\nFor one thing, the protests have been remarkably multiracial, something that has not always been the case in protest movements. Second, the fact that a majority of Americans support the ongoing protests is comforting. A majority even say protesters' burning down the Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct was justified. This continues the trend from Black Lives Matter protests five years ago: major protests in response to police killings won over a majority of the public to protesters' perspective that racism and police violence are major problems.\n\nStill, all is not well - not just with the actions of police in the streets, but also with Democratic mayors and governors who legitimize police terror with their hemming and hawing about individual responsibility and \"outside agitators.\"\n\nThat is why it is heartening that protesters from Oakland to New York are not hesitating to demand an end to police curfews, even risking violence and arrest to defy them.\n\nFinally, activists are right to call for the resignation of not only Trump , but all \"liberal\" Democratic mayors and other public officials who have allowed police to use curfews as a pretense to brutalize peaceful protests. Democrats have allowed extreme and unconstitutional repression to become the acceptable bipartisan \"center\" of US politics; we have to change that.\n\nRecent police killings and crackdowns come on top of the cruel inaction and profiteering that define our country's response to coronavirus. With 100,000 dead and 30 million out of work - and with black Americans drastically overrepresented among both groups - billionaires are using the crisis to plunder workers, neighborhoods, and the public sector. George Floyd himself was unemployed due to the pandemic and looking for work in Minneapolis when he was accused of forgery.\n\nChris Brooks writes in Labor Notes that employers are lobbying for a deadly reopening of the economy because they stand to profit enormously. Our government has not set up the systems needed for a safe reopening, like testing and contact tracing and a massive increase in spending on healthcare and other services. But billionaires are already pushing governments to \"lower taxes and to gut services despite the glaring evidence, revealed by the pandemic, that we need more government, not less.\" Their principle is,\"Recovery for me, poverty for thee.\"\n\nFor black Americans during the pandemic, poverty and racism have combined horrifically. \"Black mortality from COVID-19 is over 3.5 times higher than it is for whites because of poverty, pollution, lack of health insurance, crowded housing and transportation,\" Brooks writes in the Call , \"and the fact that such a high percentage of essential workers are people of color. One out of every 2,000 black Americans has died from this pandemic.\"\n\nMeanwhile, David Sirota explains that at the same time NYPD are brutalizing protesters, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo \" granted health care executives legal immunity for their profit-maximizing decisions that may have contributed to the deaths of thousands of people in nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.\"\n\nThe United States is long overdue for a serious and worker-centered response to the pandemic and the economic crisis it has caused. The health and economic impacts are far worse in the United States due to the extreme austerity - except for ballooning police and military budgets - of the last fifty years. Protesters have to demand we reverse that.\n\nWhile we might not be heading for a 1789-style revolution, activists are staying in the streets in the face of escalating violence and demanding solutions to the deep crises workers face. History teaches us that events can move at breakneck speed in such times. It also teaches us that we can win.\n\nEven if street protests wane in the coming weeks, none of these demands will become irrelevant anytime soon. In order to keep momentum, activists will have to keep the focus on clear demands like defunding the police. We need to build broad, multiracial, democratic organizations that can anchor this movement for the long haul while innovating protest tactics that can work at scale during social distancing.\n\nLeft union activists should organize with their coworkers in calling for the labor movement to champion protesters' demands, and workers should take direct action to support protests wherever possible. As Paul Heideman writes , \"Significantly weakening the police will require a tremendous amount of social power,\" and organized workers carrying out persistent \"nonviolent coercion against capital and the state\" are essential for a left movement to build this power.\n\nTransit and food workers have already struck in multiple cities to stymy the police crackdown, and solidarity strikes that are not directly related to police or protests could still bolster the movement and apply pressure to capitalists and politicians to make concessions. Police unions should, at minimum, be kicked out of joint labor councils and isolated from the rest of the labor movement.\n\nLeft-wing elected officials should be pushed to speak out in support of the movement while introducing legislation channeling movement demands. Incredibly, this demand is already being pushed in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Oakland . Democrats who side with the police or take their campaign contributions should be isolated.\n\nSocialists also have a duty, to paraphrase Mike Davis's recent call to action , to ensure that the base of activists demobilized after the Sanders campaign is reactivated to fight to reclaim our streets from violent police and for a worker-centered coronavirus response. \"We need to show them that there is a campaign-apart from the November elections-that calls for thousands of dedicated organizers and volunteers.\" There is an opportunity to \"to put real fire back into the hearth of solidarity\" right now, and we must seize it.\n\nWhile we were not ready for this upheaval, the Left has to support its growth and consolidation. Justice and democracy depend on it.\n\nJeremy Gong is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America in California's East Bay.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

We spoke with one of the protest organizers about the action - and why labor must take the lead in the fight against police violence.\n\nA container ship travels through the San Francisco Bay en route to the Port of Oakland on February 20, 2015 in San Francisco, California.\nJustin Sullivan / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTo honor George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and all victims of police repression, dockworkers on both coasts are taking action at noon today (ET), to coincide with the funeral of George Floyd in Houston. On the West Coast, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) will be stopping work and taking an eight minute, forty-six second moment of silence.\n\nJacobin's Eric Blanc spoke with one of the protest organizers, Clarence Thomas - former Secretary Treasurer of ILWU Local 10 - about the action and the need for labor unions to take a lead in the struggle against police violence and racism. As the resolution calling for this action explains, \"all lives will matter when Black lives matter because an injury to one is an injury to all.\"\n\nWhy did ILWU decide to organize this work stoppage today?\n\nFighting police murders and white supremacy is a class question. Let's not forget that the vast majority of black people, and the vast majority of victims of police repression, are working class.\n\nFor many years now, ILWU, and Local 10 in particular, has been protesting the racist policing of African Americans. And we understand that the way these murders can be stopped is when there are economic consequences. The working class has leverage - and we need to use it.\n\nWe think that the most effective way to stop police terror is by the working class taking action at the point of production: if the working class is going to be heard, labor must shut it down. That's why today at 9 AM [Pacific Time], all the longshore locals on the West Coast will be taking an eight minute, forty-six second moment of silence in memory of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and all victims of racist police terror. I also understand that the ILA [the longshore union on the East Coast] will be taking a similar action.\n\nWe believe that labor should strive to be at the vanguard of all social struggles, because we understand that labor has a responsibility to fight for those beyond just our own membership. Think about the demand of the eight-hour workday and the elimination of child labor - these were demands that unions a century ago won for the whole working class. It's that kind of spirit we need to revive today.\n\nThis is the tradition of the militant labor movement. And that's why there is such a concerted effort by those in power to give workers amnesia about our own history - to separate us from the real history of our class and our militancy. Learning about our real past reveals the real contradiction between the interests of labor and those who own the means of production.\n\nDo you think the labor movement is doing enough to fight against police repression and racial injustice?\n\nNo. Labor cannot continue to remain silent on racist policing. Anytime a black person or person of color is killed by the police, workers and unions need to be shutting down their workplaces. Protest is one thing, actual resistance and action at the point of production is something else.\n\nUnions should be raising demands for defunding the police and revoking the membership of police associations from our labor councils. The police in many cities are part of the central labor councils - we think this is a major contradiction because cops are not a part of the labor movement. Whenever there's a strike, the police are called in to defend the bosses, intimidate workers, protect scabs. They always defend the powerful and the privileged.\n\nUnfortunately, labor has forgotten that cops are the enforcers of the bosses. Think about Minneapolis, which has sparked this national revolt. Back in 1934 Minneapolis had a general strike led by the Teamsters, during which two striking truck drivers were killed by cops on Bloody Friday. And in San Francisco in the 1934 general strike led by longshore workers, we had Bloody Thursday, when police shot and killed two strikers.\n\nIn many instances, trade unionists just don't know about that history of police killings. They don't know how the rank-and-file in places like Minneapolis and San Francisco took on the National Guard, the police, the vigilantes, and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1930s and '40s. The rulers of this country don't want workers to understand our power, to have class consciousness.\n\nIt seems like ILWU is definitely more of an exception than the rule in labor. Can you tell our readers more about ILWU's anti-racist track record?\n\nI'm proud to say that ILWU, and Local 10 in particular, has been in the vanguard of the labor movement when it comes to fighting white supremacy and police murder.\n\nIn 1967 Dr King spoke to an ILWU Local 10 meeting and became an honorary member. We took workplace actions to fight apartheid in South Africa. And back in 2010 we shut down the ports to demand justice for Oscar Grant, a young black man shot by BART police officer Johannes Mehserle on New Year's Eve. To my knowledge, that was the first time in the history of the modern labor movement that a work stoppage was organized against racist police terror. And for the past five we've shut down the ports on May Day to say no to this repression unleashed against African Americans.\n\nOne of the key reasons why ILWU Local 10 is the only predominantly African-American local on the West Coast - and one of the main reasons for our long-standing fight against racism - is that in 1934 leftist rank-and-file leaders of the strike like Harry Bridges (who was an immigrant from Australia) and Henry Schmidt (who was a member of the Communist Party) saw that black people were being used as scabs and they realized that they needed the support of black workers to win the strike. So Harry Bridges went to speak at black churches in the community and he said: \"We want to offer you a new deal - a real new deal. If the black community supports the strike, we will fight for their inclusion in the union and for their rights.\"\n\nIt was a blow against white supremacy and a major turning point. Long before affirmative action became widespread, Bridges and other leftists understood that discrimination is a tool of the bosses, it is used to divide the working class. Radicals understood that the interests of white workers were inextricably linked to the interests of black workers. They understood the intersection of race and class. Ever since, longshore jobs have represented good union jobs not just for the working class in general, but for the black working class in particular.\n\nWhere do you think the movement should go from here?\n\nThere is now a widespread recognition among young people and others that we need to fight white supremacy. But it's one thing to protest, it's another to build a movement. And we need to be able to engage the working class in struggle. Young people need to know that no matter how many people are out in the streets, to really win big transformational change you need workers. We need to organize in our own name, independent of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nSo what do we do now, after we captured the attention of the ruling class and world? We have to begin to organize and move to seize power, to win real change. And that type of change means fighting for transitional demands like defunding the police. Like removing police unions from our Central Labor Councils, defunding is a first great step.\n\nIn cities across the country, we keep on seeing cuts to social services, schools, and hospitals, but we never see cuts to police departments. They have the most advanced military surveillance equipment, while people who work in public hospitals are forced to use garbage bags and reuse masks. That should tell you something.\n\nI also want to let your readers know about a big new development initiated by Local 10. This year, ILWU will be withholding its labor on Juneteenth - June 19, the holiday celebrating the ending of slavery in the United States. All twenty-nine ports on the West Coast will be shut down by the ILWU on Juneteenth for eight hours to demand an end to white supremacy, an end to police terror, and an end to the plans to privatize the port of Oakland - which would take away essential jobs for working-class African Americans in the Bay Area. And we're calling on unions across the country to join us in this action on Juneteenth. It's time. Labor must begin to take a lead in the fight against racist police terror.\n\nClarence Thomas is the former secretary treasurer of International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 10.\n\nEric Blanc is the author of Red State Revolt: The Teachers' Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Cities are pledging to shift money from cops to public services, violent officers are being disciplined and fired, and a wave of left victories came in last week's primaries.\n\nProtesters march on Hiawatha Avenue while decrying the killing of George Floyd on May 26, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nStephen Maturen / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWelcome to the uprising. We're beginning to learn that we can take on the ruling class - and its deranged, murderous servants - and win.\n\nProtest doesn't accomplish much if you only do it once or twice a year. That's why, in ordinary times, most people don't bother. But these are not ordinary times. All over the country people have been flooding the streets, every day and night for some two weeks, protesting the racist murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. In the past, protests would have raged for a few days, and most often, homicidal police officers would not only have walked free, but kept their jobs.\n\nBut this isn't the past. Four officers have been fired and charged in Floyd's murder. An astonishing number of police officers have been disciplined, fired and even charged in violence against protesters. In Louisville, where police shot and killed a black man over a curfew violation on June 1, the police chief has been fired.\n\nOnce, each of these triumphs might have been big news. But the movement isn't satisfied, and the preliminary victories haven't even stopped there. Statues beloved by racists, honoring racists - Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia, Confederates throughout the South - are coming down. New York City ended its unjust and authoritarian curfew, which was only an excuse to arrest peaceful protesters at the expense of public health. The New York and Minneapolis City Councils have banned the use of chokeholds. As many also protested the death of Breonna Taylor, a Louisville EMT who was murdered by police in her own home last March, cities have also been abolishing \"no knock\" warrants.\n\nInstitutions are quickly changing, too, as Americans begin to understand the extent to which the working class, especially blacks, immigrants and young people, are grotesquely overpoliced. Portland and Minneapolis are ending the use of police officers in public schools. The Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Department also ended its relationship with the police department. Even more surprisingly, calls to abolish and defund the police are rapidly gaining traction. The Minneapolis City Council seems ready to disband its police department. Los Angeles is already making cuts to its police budget to fund other social needs. Until now, New York City's truculent mayor has genuflected pathetically to a police department that despises him. He has been like a bullied kid trying to be liked by a gang of sadists who will only bully him more. Yet even he, faced with this uprising, has agreed to cut the police budget and divert the money into youth services.\n\nOf course, many details of these plans remain murky, and every reform - especially at the national level - will be vigorously contested by the police unions, President Trump, and many Democrats, but it is astonishing for the movement to have come so far after not even two weeks of protest.\n\nWe are winning electoral victories, too. Not long ago, if even one socialist ran for City Council and beat the machine, we'd be elated. That did happen last week: Jeneese Lewis George, in Washington, DC, won decisively after her opponent sent out flyers \"warning\" that she'd fire police - perhaps voters liked the sound of that! But she wasn't alone. Last week's primaries were remarkable. In Philadelphia, Nikil Saval, a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)-backed writer who supported decriminalizing sex work and ending stop and frisk, also decisively won his primary for the state senate, beating an incumbent, while another DSA candidate, Rick Krajewski, is ahead at the time of this writing, with more absentee ballots to count. DSA member and Our Revolution-backed Summer Lee, the first black woman to represent Southwestern Pennsylvania in the state senate, won reelection with 75 percent of the vote. Six Our Revolution-backed Berniecrats won primaries in Montana. Even the Republican primaries did not fail to spark joy: racist Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King lost his seat.\n\nWe continue to fill the streets, and act ungovernably, while also ejecting those governing who have failed the people. We're also calling our friends and neighbors, telling them how to vote by mail, and explaining why they should vote for socialists and other left-wing candidates. We are building our institutions: DSA has now reached over 70,000 members.\n\nAnd we're just getting started. This movement will take specific forms and directions we couldn't have predicted and, sometimes, wouldn't have chosen; perhaps some demands haven't even been part of our imaginary because they weren't possible in our youth, or even last month. Many new to the movement will have to try new things that are uncomfortable. All of us are having to quickly acquire skills we don't yet have. It's time to pay close attention, listen carefully, and ask what we can do to help. We must also claim and celebrate every win.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt the Washington Post , political scientists are declaring the George Floyd uprising to be the broadest in US history. The distinction was previously held by the Women's Marches of January 2017, but the authors analyzed the data and found that the George Floyd protests have occurred in far more places than Women's Marches did - including hundreds of minor cities and small towns. In big cities, marches are drawing tens of thousands at a time, and even smaller cities are hosting multiple protests per day.\n\nThe protests are multiracial, and though they skew millennial and younger, they're also multigenerational. They're drawing participants from all across the wealth and income spectrum of the working class, broadly defined. They're happening everywhere, from high schools to highways. Some are family-friendly pickets, others involve squaring off against police firing tear gas and projectiles. They're all united under the banner of justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the slogan Black Lives Matter as well as the demand to defund the police.\n\nAnd they're not letting up. \"The United States rarely has protests in this combination of size, intensity and frequency,\" wrote the researchers at the Washington Post . \"It usually has big protests or sustained protests, but not both.\" What's happening right now, while it builds on a decade of mounting protest movements, is genuinely unprecedented.\n\nFew saw this coming. For example, I wrote an article two months ago in which I speculated that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown would be an intermission in what has otherwise been an age of mass protest - the eye of the hurricane, so to speak - and that when the shutdown was over and the coast was clear the protests would come roaring back with ferocity. I did not think mass protests would occur in the middle of the pandemic, and I certainly didn't expect they would focus on the long-standing issue of police violence against black people.\n\nPinpointing the precise combination of forces and pressures that converged to produce this uprising at this time will occupy historians and journalists for years to come. But one thing does seem clear so far: the brutal police response to the protests merely emboldened them. They are partly responsible for giving the movement the mass character it now has.\n\nThe police are violent. People protest police violence. The police brutally crack down on the protestors, generating more antipathy for police and therefore more protestors against police violence. It's a tale as old as time, and you'd think police officials would have learned by now that excessive use of force in these scenarios is bad strategy.\n\nBut I suspect they weren't acting from a place of strategy so much as from defensive pride. It was in this emotional state that police not only brutalized protestors over the last week but topped off their aggression with spiteful flourishes , from spitting on fully restrained protestors to pulling down their masks to pepper-spray them directly in the face. As I observed last week , the police by and large do not appear to view themselves as peacekeepers in this conflict. They seem to see themselves as combatants whose goal is not to restore order and protect the public but to defeat their opponents: the protestors.\n\nAn academic paper from 2017 sheds some light on this phenomenon. In \"Protesting the Police: Anti-Police Brutality Claims as a Predictor of Police Repression of Protest,\" Heidi Reynolds-Stenson examined the police response to thousands of US protests that occurred between 1960 and 1995. She found that police \"are about twice as likely to show up to anti-police brutality protests compared with otherwise similar protests making other claims and, once there, they intervene (either make arrests, use force or violence against protesters, or both) at nearly half of these protests, compared to about one in three protests making other claims.\"\n\nYou'd think the police would take pains to avoid appearing to brutalize protestors whose primary grievance is police brutality. But Reynolds-Stetson found that \"despite the possibility that reputational concerns would lead police to deal with such protests with special caution, police actually react to the threat posed by these protests with a more heavy handed response than other protests.\" It is precisely the anti-police sentiment that makes them angry, which in turn makes them hostile, which finally leads them to behave in ways that intensify popular anti-police sentiment.\n\nThat appears to be precisely what happened in the last week and a half. The earlier protests were accompanied by more property destruction and theft, which is not broadly popular , but the police more than made up for it by perpetrating in some cases extreme violence against peaceful protestors. Outrage at the police reaction has driven more and more people into the streets, giving the movements an ever-broader character.\n\nNow, in cities across the country, police appear to have backed off, at least from the daytime protests - not totally , but noticeably. This is probably in part because officers are fatigued and demoralized , and in part because they realize their initial aggression backfired. As a result of this partial retreat, the daytime protests in particular appear safer, which invites more people, and more kinds of people, into streets. Even those who aren't participating are largely supportive, including 57 percent of white respondents to one survey (only 26 percent opposed) and, amazingly, 45 percent of Republican voters (only 22 percent opposed). These numbers were up significantly from the previous week.\n\nOver the weekend, many daytime protests across the country had a festival-like quality to them. At two I attended in Los Angeles, the police were nowhere to be seen, apparently opting to save their tear gas and rubber bullets for those who lingered after dark. But the change in police tactics came too late. They have unwittingly helped create a mass anti-police protest movement, one that's happening in cities and towns across the country. And unfortunately for them, it's bigger than any protest movement the country has ever seen.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

And most shocking of all, the protests are winning.\n\nA protest at the Country Club Plaza on May 31, 2020 in Kansas City, Missouri.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt least since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August of 2014, every publicized death of an African American at the hands of police has triggered a spasm of protest - before winding down. Though the protests that have erupted across the United States in the three weeks since the horrific killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day are very different.\n\nFor starters, the protests have now been sustained for three weeks with no real end in sight. Second, the numbers - of protesters, protest events, and protest sites - have all grown over time. Though an increase in the number of protesters in the early days of a movement is not unusual, the proliferation of events, and especially protest sites, is rare.\n\nGiven the pattern of previous Black Lives Matter demonstrations, the initial wave of protests in major cities around the country was hardly surprising. And the spread of the movement into progressive communities such as Santa Monica, California; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts was predictable as well.\n\nBut when the protests began popping up in conservative, predominantly white communities, it was clear, to paraphrase Dorothy, that we were \"no longer in Kansas.\" Or, rather, that counter to history and recent partisan politics, we in fact were in Kansas, and not just in Kansas City, but also, as reported in the Kansas City Star , in small, overwhelmingly white towns such as Overland Park, Shawnee, and Olathe. And this spread of protests beyond the major cities has taken place across all fifty states.\n\nThis fact brings us to the most important, and potentially consequential, difference between the current protests and any we've seen in recent years: the racial and ethnic diversity of the current protest wave. Given this is an ongoing and young movement, it is hard to get a systematic handle on the demographics of the protesters, but there is simply no denying the diversity of those taking part.\n\nWorking with Michael Heaney, Dana Fischer, the acknowledged maven of contemporary protest studies, surveyed protesters at early demonstrations in Los Angeles, New York, and DC, and reported the following percentages of those taking part.\n\nVideo footage that I've seen from protests in those same three locations, plus Minneapolis, suggests a more even demographic distribution than the above figures suggest, but even allowing for variation across sites, it's clear that the demographic mix is far more varied than anything we have seen in recent years. And indeed, far more diverse than anything we saw during the heyday of the mass Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. In fact, while the '60s movement benefited at times from considerable white support, the levels of actual protest participation by whites was minimal.\n\nThis is hardly surprising when you consider that the major campaigns and actions during the heyday of the movement in the early '60s - the sit-ins in 1960, the Freedom Rides in 1961, Albany in 1962, Birmingham in 1963, Selma in 1965 - all took place in the South, and virtually all white Southerners were implacably opposed to the threat the movement posed to \"the Southern way of life.\"\n\nTo be sure, there were sympathy demonstrations in the North in support of the sit-ins, and considerable white financial support for the major civil rights organizations, but very little in the way of active white participation in the major Southern campaigns.\n\nAnd when the struggle turned northward in response to the onset of the riots in the mid-1960s, even the generalized sympathy the movement had enjoyed in the early '60s largely evaporated. This shift was occasioned by the new goals the movement embraced as it sought to contend with the more complicated forms of systemic racism endemic outside the South. Movement aims during the Southern phase of the struggle called for little more than the dismantling of an anachronistic caste system in which few whites outside the South had any stake.\n\nOver time, however, the movement's goals were broadened to embody a more holistic critique of the complex patterns of \"institutional racism\" in which the interests of many who had earlier \"supported\" the movement were implicated. The effect of this change was to greatly erode white support for, and significantly increase white opposition to, the movement.\n\nGeographically, the shift of the struggle from South to North had much of the same effect. Confined almost exclusively to the states of the former Confederacy in the early 1960s, the movement posed little threat to residents in other regions of the country.\n\nHowever, with the advent of the riots, open-housing marches, and court-ordered busing in the late '60s and early '70s, the comfortable illusion that racism was a distinctly Southern problem was shattered. By the mid-to-late 1960s white opposition to the movement was as much a Northern as a Southern phenomenon.\n\nIt should also be noted that the movement's shift from interracialism to Black Power, and then black separatism after, say, 1965-66 also limited the opportunities for white participation in the struggle. Bottom line: without gainsaying the reality and significance of generalized white support for the movement in the early 1960s, the number of whites who were active in a sustained way in the struggle were comparatively few, and certainly nothing like the percentages we have seen taking part in recent weeks. Whether that continues, of course, remains to be seen.\n\nThe demographic diversity of the current wave of protests isn't the only thing that marks the current wave as distinctive. For all the attention and hope we tend to lavish on protests, the truth is, very few such episodes result in any meaningful social and/or political change. Occupy Wall Street burst onto the scene in the fall of 2011, generating widespread public sympathy, and temporarily \"changed the conversation,\" but, in the end, accomplished little.\n\nOr think of the various gun violence protests triggered by the numbing litany of mass shooting incidents we've suffered as a nation over the past decade or so: Parkland High School, Sandy Hook, Charleston, and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. And yet little or no meaningful policy change has come from any of those protests.\n\nAnd save perhaps for the rare instance of local police reform, the same can be said of the protests that occurred in recent years in the wake of the killing of far too many African Americans at the hands of police - at least until George Floyd. It looks, for all the world, like these protests are achieving what very few do: setting in motion a period of significant, sustained, and widespread social and political change.\n\nThe many efforts to reform policing - including the Senate and House bills currently under consideration - are rightfully getting the lion's share of attention, but they hardly exhaust the changes being considered at the moment. Indeed, the many calls to \"defund\" or even eliminate police departments are as much about reinvesting resources in social programs, mental health initiatives, job training, and the like as it is narrowly about police reform.\n\nIf the efforts to change that are being proposed were confined to the above, we would be justified in declaring the George Floyd \"movement\" a slam dunk success. But something remarkable appears to be happening beyond the efforts to reform law enforcement, and reimagine what a more generous and equitable social welfare system would look like.\n\nLots of organizations and institutions appear to be embracing this as a watershed moment in their history, asking what the current moment demands of them, or what changes they need to make to advance the overarching goals of social justice and racial equity. For example, Comcast has announced it is committing $100 million to a three-year plan to advance social justice and equality, and fight \"injustice and inequality against any race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or ability.\"\n\nEven allowing for a healthy dose of cynicism on the part of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's embrace of Black Lives Matter, it is still symbolically significant and a pointed rebuke to President Donald Trump. NASCAR's banning of Confederate flags at its event is another striking symbolic response to the moment, especially given the sport's popularity in the South.\n\nAnd for every one of these highly publicized actions by high-profile enterprises, there are countless others taking place in smaller, less visible companies and institutions. I will confine myself to just two from my own life. A friend of mine works for an urban planning firm that organized and hired a professional to facilitate an online, company-wide conversation about race and equity as a first step toward reforming its internal organizational practices. Stanford's academic program review board - the body that rules on cases of academic probation and suspension - is undertaking a systematic review of its procedures, to determine whether they are sufficiently sensitive to the challenges faced by traditionally disadvantaged students, especially in the context of COVID-19 and the protests roiling our communities.\n\nThere are many such examples. Put together, we appear to be experiencing a social change tipping point that is as rare as it is potentially consequential. However, notwithstanding all the energy and momentum generated by the protests, and what appears to be a related drop in Donald Trump's poll numbers, his reelection in November remains a real threat, all the more so since the pandemic threatens the high-voter turnout that Democrats rely on, as well as enabling the kind of voter suppression that the Republicans favor.\n\nThe best we can hope for is to do everything we can to maintain the momentum, energy, and inclusive, pragmatic, and nonviolent character of the current protests. Our goal should be twofold: to capitalize on the possibilities for change inherent in this moment, and to begin to pivot toward forms of electoral mobilization crucial to success in the fall. The survival of American democracy will likely depend on how successfully we attend to this agenda.\n\nDouglas McAdam is Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Sociology, Emeritus at Stanford University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

We spoke with the president of the bus driver union's black caucus about the inspiring action and the need for a labor movement that fights for more than just bread-and-butter economic gains for its members.\n\nA sculpture of a raised fist stands in a memorial for George Floyd outside Cup Foods on June 7, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The cry of Black Lives Matter can be heard in small towns and big cities throughout the United States.\n\nThe question is, will organized labor recognize their collective power and step up in this moment to propel the movement forward? In Minneapolis , bus drivers organized under the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1005 provide an example of what that looks like. After protests erupted, they refused to transport police officers and instead made it clear that they stood with the broader working class.\n\nBianca Cunningham, an organizer and staff writer at Labor Notes , recently sat down with Doni Jones, bus driver and president of the black caucus of the ATU's Minneapolis local, to discuss policing and how to bridge the gap between Black Lives Matter and the labor movement.\n\nWhat's it been like for you these last couple weeks?\n\nIt's been really hectic. We already had drivers who didn't want to drive because of COVID, and then we were expected to transport the police. There was one instance of police getting on our bus and an officer recording a video of himself saying, \"We're the bone crushers, and we're going to kick some niggers' asses.\"\n\nWe are not receiving hazard pay and have not been this whole time. This is making tensions twice as high - they are expecting us to do too much.\n\nAll of this led us to refuse to transport the police. The transit authority tried to say we had to use our personal or vacation time if we refused to bus the police. The Metropolitan Council, who runs metro transit, got $226 million from the federal government for COVID relief, and yet we still aren't being paid, and we are out here in the streets taking the risks.\n\nNow that the National Guard is gone, there are no police buses. We held our stance while they were here and decided to just use our own time.\n\nWhy is it important to have a black caucus? What role do they play in the broader union?\n\nThe black caucus is for everyone, not just for black people. I founded it and started it in 2017. It was the first black caucus in Local 1005.\n\nIt's a tool that we use to educate and get engagement from union members. There are black issues that need to be addressed on the job site. There is racism on the job. We are the last hired and the first fired. We also experience more extreme discipline than our white counterparts.\n\nBut I have tried to instill the idea that we are all in this together.\n\nIn a recent speech where you announced that ATU Local 1005 would no longer be transporting police officers, you also said that the only color that matters is green and that you wouldn't be in this position if you had money. Can you say more about that?\n\nMy grandfather would say, \"The only color that matters is green.\" He warned me of this as I grew up to become a man.\n\nWhat I meant by that is money equals power, and since we don't have money, we have to take our power in the streets. We have numbers, but it takes a long time to build power without money.\n\nRight now, we have no ownership or power within the current institutions. I look at George Floyd, and he got murdered over a supposed fake $20 bill. It always comes down to money. We all have the same interests at the end of the day. We are fighting for our lives against people with money and power.\n\nIn that same speech, you posed a question to the crowd. You asked, \"What are we going to do to police our own communities?\" What does that mean to you?\n\nIt's simple. We have to bring respect back into our communities. We don't need the police to come in and beat up our kids; we need to have resources so that we can educate and protect our children.\n\nWe grew up with the idea of \"it takes a village.\" We've gotten away from those principles. The culture has turned so individual.\n\nWe need to be talking about how we can support one another and uplift one another. We have to stand up and stick together. We have to start holding ourselves and our electeds accountable: Amy Klobuchar was a DA and has zero police convictions - do you think we wanted her to be president? No! She is a part of the system.\n\nWhy do you think it's important that organized labor speak up about issues of racial justice and police brutality? What could unions do both in this moment and beyond to fight for the societal changes needed to end systemic racism?\n\nLabor needs to look at the source. Once you take the color out of it, you say poor people. Poor people are getting screwed out of their jobs, poor people are losing benefits. There are a lot of people who would never march for black lives, but we need to convince them that poor white people have the interests of poor blacks. This is about everyone. We all need health care, we all need better wages, we all need job security.\n\nMany unions in Minnesota were out passing out food, water, and supplies to the protesters. This is a simple way to show solidarity. We also need more political education in our unions on these issues. The goal is to get people educated so that they will turn into active members.\n\nDoni Jones is a bus driver in Minneapolis and the president of the black caucus of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1005.\n\nBianca Cunningham is a staff writer and organizer at Labor Notes .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

He decries the appalling militarized response to protests - and says police must be placed under civilian control rather than being allowed to kill with impunity.\n\nA picture of George Floyd hangs on the barrier that surrounds the Hennepin County Government Center, where former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was on  trial for murder. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOmar Fateh, a Minnesota state senator and Democratic Socialists of America member, is a freshman lawmaker who represents the district where George Floyd was killed. Over the last year, he's had an up-close view of the social and political upheaval in the city, where radical demands for racial and economic justice have exploded.\n\nOn Sunday night, shortly before the closing arguments and jury deliberations began in the Derek Chauvin murder trial - and just days after the killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota - we spoke with Fateh about what things look like on the ground and in the state legislature around weakening the power of the police.\n\nCan you describe what's been happening in Minneapolis and Brooklyn Center, and what you've been doing in the senate?\n\nI started off the session connecting with local folks on the ground, coming up with legislation around police accountability, and working with folks in the state senate and the house. There have been several hearings on the house side, and some of the bills have passed, but on the senate side we've had zero hearings. They've been completely blocked, even though at the end of last session Republican majority leader Paul Gazelka indicated that the negotiations they had and the agreement they came up with - which was a package that was pretty weak - was just a starting point and that we'd reengage in these talks in the upcoming session. The inaction has shown that all of what was discussed last year was just a punt - hoping that things would slow down and there wouldn't be as much steam behind these efforts.\n\nNow, with the trial in the murder of George Floyd, folks have started taking to the streets again - people want to see justice. We're all basing our opinion that there might be a not-guilty verdict on the history: there's a consistent pattern of police officers getting away with murder.\n\nAnd even as we've seen inactivity in the senate, a twenty-year-old black man, a father, Daunte Wright, was murdered by a white officer who claims she was reaching for her taser. That's a claim I do not buy.\n\nThis is a systemic issue. It's not a training issue, it's not an issue of what can be reformed. And there's been zero support on the Republican side and a lot of neglect on the Democratic side as well.\n\nWhat have you seen in your district and in Brooklyn Center in terms of mobilization of police and military?\n\nNumber one, I was really proud to see a lot of our constituents and folks that have been organizing at George Floyd Square go up to Brooklyn Center to show solidarity when the murder of Daunte Wright occurred. That was really amazing to watch.\n\nIn terms of the militarization, I see that as a complete failure. The state, the city, the county - all local levels of government and law enforcement - have had one year to prepare for large crowds and protests. We knew what was coming, we knew people were going to take to the streets, and instead we opted for militarization, we opted for having the National Guard and law enforcement come in.\n\nIt was a choice to do so. It was a choice to inflict harm on protesters with rubber bullets and chemical weapons (which, by the way, have been banned now by the Brooklyn Center City Council, but are still being used, from what I understand, based on the county authorizing it).\n\nThere seems to be a decision to use crowd control and to intimidate and put fear into protesters to not come back. For example, we've had two nights in which protesters were gathered en masse and locked up, violating their First Amendment rights, and told that they would be detained for thirty-six hours. This included folks in the press, people who should not be touched, who have a right to be there to provide accountability and show the truth of what's going on on the ground.\n\nSo this whole situation has been a complete failure.\n\nWhat are some things that you and your allies in the state legislature have tried to propose to address this, and how have those efforts fared?\n\nI proposed a bill earlier this year that would basically ban law enforcement from associating with any white nationalist or white supremacist groups. It failed in committee. I brought it up [last week] as an amendment on the floor, and it was voted down on party lines. You think it would make sense for us to not have folks in public service who are white supremacists, but that was shot down.\n\nI've called for a stall in budget negotiations and conference committees until we first have hearings and pass meaningful police accountability. We should not adjourn this year without taking any action. That would be a travesty, and that would be a slap in the face to our communities.\n\nThere are a few pieces of legislation that could make a difference. The first is ending qualified immunity for police officers - which would mean not letting officers guilty of police misconduct off the hook when civil action is taken against them.\n\nThe second is tightening up rules around body cameras - prohibiting any erasing or altering of recordings and also giving the next of kin of those killed by police the right to an unredacted recording within forty-eight hours.\n\nLastly, bringing back civilian oversight and input. We need to remove state restrictions to allow local governments to put in place civilian oversight that has actual teeth, that can conduct fact-finding and actually discipline officers.\n\nThose are just a few things I think we can get in the senate, but right now, what I've heard is that [Republican state senator and majority leader] Paul Gazelka has agreed only to have \"fact-finding\" hearings. But we know the facts. We know what's going on. People of color are being murdered; black men are being murdered. And it's a decision whether we want to act or not.\n\nI just want to make one thing clear again: this is not a training issue. This is a decades and decades-old system that has gotten away with murdering black men and people of color. Officers are doing so knowing that they can get away with it. And the fact that we had zero push this year to get anything on the senate side, the fact that senate Republicans refuse to acknowledge white supremacists have infiltrated our law enforcement agencies, is very troubling.\n\nThere's a reason why people are calling for defunding the police and abolishing the police in general. It's gotten to a point where there's just a complete distrust of law enforcement based off of what people are seeing on TV and based off of their own lived experiences.\n\nOnce someone puts on that blue uniform, the trust is just not there. Once someone, whether they're a black person or a white person, puts on that blue uniform, there is a level of unease and discomfort and fear put into people, specifically people of color.\n\nOmar Fateh is the Minnesota state senator for District 62 and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nThomas Bergstrom is a freelance writer living in Minneapolis.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

So far, there's little sign that the city council or Mayor Bill de Blasio are prepared to give in.\n\nNew York City police officers are seen across from City Hall. Demonstrations continue with protests and demands for lawmakers to cut the NYPD budget. Jeenah Moon / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now.

It's Sunday evening, June 28, and we're in lower Manhattan - the City Hall subway station in the middle of the encampment is closed, the entrance draped in \"Abolish the Police\" banners, DEFUND NYPD graffiti chalked onto the gate.\n\nThe occupier announcing the teach-in walks further through the encampment, toward a couple playing guitar and violin next to a chalked memorial of people killed by the New York Police Department (NYPD). Akai Gurley, his likeness sketched wearing a baseball cap, is beside Eric Garner. Shantel Davis is below Garner, and Ramarley Graham is beside Davis. \"Rest in Power NYC,\" reads the sidewalk memorial. A bouquet of white roses rests on the ground next to the memorial; a few prayer candles sit among the portraits.\n\nThe occupation at City Hall has one very specific demand: cut the NYPD budget by $1 billion and reallocate that money. The current budget for the NYPD is around $6 billion, making this a moderate demand, albeit one that many city councilors and the mayor oppose. (The demand among some groups at the occupation is to push for a greater cut, up to 50 percent.)\n\n\"People need to understand that we're meeting the city council where they're at by demanding $1 billion,\" says Nelini Stamp, a member of the collective of black activists that launched the occupation. \"But the long-term goal is abolition and black liberation, the long-term goal is to destroy capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy.\"\n\n\"This is how policy works,\" says Brandon West, another member of the organizing collective.\n\nBy day, Stamp is the director of strategy for the Working Families Party. Several of the collective's members hold day jobs at nonprofits or unions - the originator of the encampment works for VOCAL-NY - and distinguished their activity in the occupation from that work.\n\nAsked why the collective decided to launch an occupation, organizers spoke of the demobilization they felt was happening after weeks of mass marches sparked by the murder of forty-two-year-old George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\n\"We wanted to find a way to escalate,\" says West. \"The idea was to create this space as an organic place for organizing and mobilization.\"\n\nJudging by the time I spent there, they've succeeded. There were simultaneous teach-ins taking place throughout the park. When an anti-police brutality march arrived at the park at 6 p.m., occupiers stood up and cheered, greeting it with chants of \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Black lives matter.\" I spotted a familiar face from Occupy Wall Street, talking with what looked to be younger activists in a corner of the occupation.\n\nWhat remains unclear is if the city council will be pressured to reallocate the $1 billion when they take up the city's budget today. Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed cutting a much lesser amount from the police budget - including an illusory reallocation of some of the budget toward the public schools in the guise of safety officers, i.e., police - but organizers emphasize that this is insufficient.\n\n\"It's surprising to me that someone who could be such a proud surrogate of Senator Sanders now can't do what needs to be done,\" says Bianca Cunningham, another member of the organizing collective and of the Afrosocialists and Socialists of Color Caucus of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Of city councilors who won't accede to the demand , Cunningham is direct: \"They're playing politics over the safety and lives of people.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of electeds, including black electeds, who are saying one thing and doing another,\" says West.\n\n\"Some black city council members have said that anyone pressuring black members are gentrifiers. And as someone born and raised in this city - blood in, blood out, this is my city - it's really offensive to hear that's what the focus is on,\" says Stamp.\n\nAs we talk, Stamp eyes the police, gathering across the street from the courthouse steps where we sit. There were reports of marchers getting pepper sprayed an hour or two earlier, and some occupiers are on edge. But as fellow occupiers pass on the sidewalk, \"see you tomorrows\" and \"stay safes\" are exchanged, and the optimism of the occupation peeks through despite a darkening sky. (After I leave the park, a biblical downpour drenches Manhattan. Later, I see videos of occupiers, decked out in raincoats, dancing in the rain.)\n\n\"This is step one,\" says Stamp. \"We need a win.\"\n\nAlex N. Press is an assistant editor at Jacobin .

The problem of racist policing won't be solved by more visibility.\n\nBystanders film police using smartphones and camcorders as they confront protesters in Harlem on May 30, 2020 in New York City. David Dee Delgado / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"How Many Weren't Filmed?!\" These words appeared on a cardboard sign held by a camo-clad man at a recent protest in Decatur, Georgia, against the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nThe words were also printed in block letters on a banner carried by demonstrators in Manchester, England, scrawled in pen on a woman's face mask in New York City, and Sharpied on poster boards in towns and cities elsewhere.\n\nThe question captures the complex reality of police brutality in the age of smartphones. It alludes, on the one hand, to how smartphones have been repurposed as a tool to fight the police, and on the other, to the limitations of smartphones as a tool to fight a mammoth, militarized, decentralized institution with a deep-rooted history of violence against poor people, particularly poor people of color.\n\nThe question also encourages us to look a bit more closely at our pocket computers, to see our smartphones as more than just a tool. Machines, Gilles Deleuze once argued, \"express those social forms capable of producing them and making use of them.\"\n\nSmartphones are incredibly expressive machines. The ways we use them reveal the social relationships and structures of power that undergird modern society - including its racial divides.\n\nBefore smartphones, police violence went mostly unseen. The deadly attack on Rodney King in 1991 stands out as an exception. It was an exception in part because the acquittal of the four LAPD officers who dealt out the vicious beating sparked a violent public response. But the assault also stands out because it was filmed by a stranger with a camcorder and sent to the local news station, providing relatively rare visual evidence of the reality of American policing.\n\nToday, smartphones are an integral part of strategies to rein in the police. Cop-watch organizations, which have been around for decades in cities across the country, immediately recognized how smartphones could be repurposed to document and potentially reduce the oppression of people of color by law enforcement.\n\nWhen Alton Sterling was killed by police for selling DVDs outside a Baton Rouge convenience store, the store's owner, Abdullah Muflahi, filmed the murder . So did the Baton Rouge nonprofit Stop the Killing, whose volunteers had been monitoring police scanner traffic.\n\nThe advent of livestreaming in particular has been a game changer, preventing police from creating a false narrative by confiscating phones and erasing video filmed by bystanders. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups have created smartphone apps such as Mobile Justice Michigan to make it easier for cop-watch volunteers and community organizations to film and stream interactions with police.\n\nThe digital strategies and sensibilities pioneered by cop-watch groups and civil rights organizations have permeated progressive movements in the past decade. Protesters of every stripe now come armed with smartphones and social media.\n\nWalter Scott was murdered in 2015 in North Charleston, South Carolina, by officer Michael Slager. Scott, unarmed, was shot five times in the back and legs as he tried to run from Slager and then handcuffed as he lay dying, face down in the dirt.\n\nAt Scott's funeral, the pastor thanked God for Feidin Santana , the man whose smartphone video of the killing brought Scott's killer to justice. \"Keep your phone handy, keep your charge up,\" the pastor implored the funeral attendees. \"You never know when you need to be around.\"\n\nFor many people of color, this sense of uncertainty, of never knowing when state-sponsored violence could strike, is inscribed in their relationship with their smartphone.\n\nDiamond Reynolds's impulse, after seeing her partner, Philando Castile, shot during a routine traffic stop in Minnesota in 2016, was to immediately pick up her phone and livestream his life being extinguished on the car seat next to her. Reynolds wanted the world to know that \"these police are not here to protect and serve us. They are here to assassinate us. They are here to kill us because we are black.\"\n\nTanya Marshall , a black mother, teacher, and active member of her community in Cambridge, Massachusetts, copes with uncertainty by treating her smartphone as a constant lifeline to her children. Marshall has a hard and fast house rule that her children are to keep their phones charged and handy at all times and must call her right away if they have a run-in with a police officer, so that she can intervene and hopefully prevent a violent interaction.\n\nMarshall's digital strategy for coping with the nagging fear that a police officer will harm one of her children is one that she says she shares with many other black parents. Yet this dynamic is largely absent in media narratives about smartphones. Popular treatments of phones, especially ones that focus on teens and their digital devices, tend to emphasize the dangers posed by smartphones, such as social media addiction, sexting, and cyberbullying.\n\nThese are serious concerns to be sure. But the fact that, over the past decade, phones have come to be seen as an essential element in the coping strategies of oppressed minorities, as well as broader political movements fighting for racial justice, suggests the need for a more nuanced understanding of technology that examines the ways our phones reflect and reconfigure long-standing divides over race, class, and gender.\n\nA closer look at our emerging smartphone norms also reveals the dense, and evolving, mechanisms of oppression that undergird police violence toward black and brown Americans - mechanisms that can diminish the power of digital strategies.\n\nIn the most basic sense, those who film cops have a target on their back. Stories pepper the web of people who've been intimidated, harassed, beaten, arrested, and jailed for filming interactions between law enforcement and civilians.\n\nCops also take advantage of people's perpetual connection to their phones to digitally monitor and harass activists. The Baltimore Police Department, for example, used a social media intelligence platform to monitor and arrest protestors during the unrest following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a young Baltimore man whose spinal cord had been severed nearly in half following a \"rough ride\" in the back of a police van.\n\nAt the same time, law enforcement agencies have responded to smartphone tactics by getting their own cameras. Six out of ten local police departments and nearly half of sheriffs' offices in the United States had deployed body-worn cameras by 2016.\n\nThis rapid uptake was initially viewed with enthusiasm by both police departments and civil rights groups. Both believed that body cameras would provide protection and accountability: cops thought cameras would protect and exonerate officers, while civil rights groups such as the ACLU believed cameras would reduce the use of force and increase police accountability.\n\nFrom the perspective of civil rights groups, the results have been disappointing. Ordinary people don't have a say in how police officers use their cameras, and cops turn their bodycams on and off at will. There is no body-camera footage, for example, from March 13, when Louisville police used a battering ram to bust into Breonna Taylor's apartment in the middle of the night, spraying her apartment with bullets, killing her in her bed.\n\nEven when police body cams are turned on, there are relatively few cases in which body-cam footage has led to officers being disciplined or jailed for violence. Moreover, while prosecutors have proven eager to use body-cam footage as evidence in court, civilians find it difficult to access the footage being used as evidence against them - footage that is shot without consent, often in private spaces.\n\nPerversely, the power of smartphones to create a vivid visual snapshot of police aggression has also had the effect of diminishing the salience of violent interactions that are not captured on film.\n\nSixteen-year-old Elena Mondragon was riding with her boyfriend in 2017 when undercover cops armed with AR-15 rifles fired on their vehicle, killing Mondragon. Few cases better exemplify gross police misconduct, yet as Melissa Nold, the civil rights attorney representing the family, told the Guardian , the case received little traction because it wasn't captured on film. \"When there's no video, that's a battle for us. People just tend to believe what is reported by the police.\"\n\nThese roadblocks and failures reinforce the obvious but important point that smartphones, body cams, and other digital devices are tools, not solutions; there is no technological fix for racist policing.\n\nNonetheless, the ways that people have woven their digital devices into the ongoing political struggle for racial justice over the past ten years are illuminating.\n\nTheir strategies reveal a dynamic terrain of resistance in which smartphones are being used to expand individual agency and to amplify a call for change that, increasingly, can no longer be ignored.\n\nNicole Aschoff is on the editorial board at Jacobin .

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nIn response to the nationwide protests, Donald Trump seems ready to take the United States to a place many have been fearing since his election. Escaping from it means recognizing that he didn't get us there alone.\n\nLaw enforcement officers stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as demonstrators protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on June 2, 2020 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThroughout Donald Trump's presidency, puzzled observers have often wondered : How is it that the Democratic Party, which regularly accuses Trump of being a dangerous authoritarian plotting a dictatorial takeover, nevertheless works again and again to extend and enhance his spying powers? The past week of protests and riots sparked by the seemingly never-ending contagion of racist police violence should offer a clue.\n\nThe shock and mental injury that understandably came with Trump's victory led many to look abroad to explain what they still find incomprehensible. It was Russian villainy, went the refrain, responsible not just for the wannabe strongman in the White House, but for all manner of \"divisive\" disruptions to peace and order in American life, from anti-fracking activism to, yes, protests against police brutality .\n\nNow, the world has been stunned by the inexhaustible flood of videos and images of this brutality that's streamed into our retinas via social media, laying bare the far more disturbing truth: the authoritarian instinct in the United States is vaster and deeper than just the man in the White House, running top to bottom, liberal to conservative.\n\nSo ubiquitous have the scenes of gratuitous police violence been these past few days that it seems almost redundant to list them at all. We've seen police around the country shove, kick, and even drive vehicles into unarmed, peaceful, and sometimes elderly protesters. We've heard reports of them attacking nurses at medical tents. We've watched them needlessly pepper spray individuals and whole crowds, even small children , and tase and drag people from their cars . We've seen the gruesome aftermath of their casual use of rubber and wooden bullets on their fellow citizens, including a pregnant woman . And we've witnessed them continuing to use the very tactics that sparked all this in the first place, pressing their knees on the necks of those they arrested in the same manner they used to snuff out George Floyd's life eight days ago. And all this while hiding their badge numbers , lest there be even a shred of a possibility they face some accountability.\n\nYet stomach-churning as it is, this kind of brutalization of protesters is nothing new. For many, most shocking has been the police's flagrant and deliberate targeting of journalists. Many were first disturbed by footage of a CNN crew being arrested live on air for no reason, even as they clearly showed officers their press badges, something the Minnesota State Patrol later felt the need to issue an easily disprovable lie about. If police were willing to do something that outrageous on camera, some wondered, what were they willing to do when they thought no one was watching?\n\nThe answer came swiftly as a spate of footage and reports documented police teargassing, macing, arresting, assaulting, and almost casually firing rubber bullets and other projectiles at journalists around the country . Bellingcat has documented at least fifty instances of police attacks on the press over the course of the protests, while US Press Freedom Tracker has identified more than one hundred violations, and at least five arrests on May 31 alone, often in instances where police were made fully aware of the reporters' credentials.\n\nMinnesota police have permanently blinded at least one reporter, Linda Tirado, apparently vindicating fears that their brazen on-air arrest augured much worse to come. Given that she doesn't work for a corporate news outlet, it's unlikely she'll receive the same groveling apology CNN chief executive Jeff Zucker got from Minnesota governor Tim Walz.\n\nMeanwhile, it increasingly looks like this wave of civil unrest has become the occasion for the civil liberties nightmare scenario many have rightly been fearing ever since the pandemic took hold.\n\nAt the head of this, of course, stands the president of the United States, who has gone out of his way to further inflame the situation. As police and protesters clashed in Minnesota, Trump now infamously quoted a racist police chief's words that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" before claiming the military was \"ready, willing, and able\" to deploy against protesters, threatening to unleash their \"unlimited power\" on American streets. He then goaded the protesters who had gathered outside the White House.\n\nAt Trump's request, military units were placed on high alert, ready to deploy if Walz, who ordered the state's first-ever full mobilization of the National Guard, requested it. While the governor ultimately didn't take that step, he boasted that he been coordinating with defense secretary Mark Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, trying to make use of military and NSA intelligence.\n\n\"The wars that we fought to protect our nation, the war on terrorism, all of that over the last seventy-two hours, these people have brought more destruction and more terror to Minnesota than anybody in our history,\" Walz said. \"That's who we're up against.\"\n\nOther cities experiencing their own unrest took extraordinary steps to limit freedom of movement. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot closed down streets, raised bridges, suspended public transportation, and imposed an indefinite curfew , giving such little notice that protesters ended up trapped. Twenty-five cities in sixteen different states had imposed their own curfews , including several parts of Los Angeles County that banned people from any public spaces starting at 1 pm - a far more restrictive measure than anything contemplated under the pandemic lockdowns. The National Guard has been deployed in a dozen states. There are now more than seventeen thousand National Guard members activated to tackle the protesters, equal to the number of troops who are deployed to do the same thing in the wars that never ended in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, various right-wingers - never ones to let a good opportunity for state violence pass - have followed Trump's lead and called for protesters to be ruthlessly put down. Esper urged governors to \"dominate the battlespace\" so as to \"get back to the right normal.\" Senator Tom Cotton recommended sending \"the 101st Airborne\" against protesters, later adding several more military units, demanding \"no quarter\" for those on the streets - meaning that they should be killed, not captured. Needless to say, a sitting senator calling for the murder of his fellow citizens is an ugly omen.\n\nBuilding off Trump's vow to declare Antifa - a label bestowed by the Right on a wide variety of groups that aren't necessarily connected to the small and loosely organized movement - a terrorist organization, several right-wingers called for violent state repression. \"Now that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\" asked Florida representative Matt Gaetz. \"We did it with Al-Qaeda terrorists, now it's time to do it with Antifa,\" tweeted Noah Pollak, a foreign policy writer, over a photo of Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAll of this culminated in Monday night's extraordinary scenes in the capital. Trump - scared of losing, eager to look \"strong,\" and upset by media coverage of his hiding in a White House bunker days earlier - threatened to send the military to cities and states to \"dominate the streets\" and put down what he called \"domestic acts of terror.\" As he spoke, and before Washington, DC's curfew had even kicked in, riot-gear-clad authorities on Trump's order attacked a group of peaceful protesters assembled in Lafayette Square, pelting them with tear gas and other projectiles and assaulting anyone in their way, including clergy and, of course, journalists , clearing the patio of a nearby church that had been used to give protesters supplies like water and hand sanitizer. With the way clear of danger, Trump walked to the church and awkwardly held up a Bible in front of cameras as sirens wailed in the background.\n\nIt was hard not to think of last year's coup in Bolivia, backed by virtually the entire political establishment in the United States. That, too, was preceded by rioting by police and other right-wing forces, with Christian rightists triumphantly brandishing Bibles as they celebrated the country's overturning of democracy.\n\nThis terrifying sequence of events has produced two sadly predictable responses: that this rampant brutality and squelching of basic civil liberties is something new and exceptional, and that it's all because of Trump.\n\nMembers of the mainstream press reacted with incredulity at the sight of the CNN crew being arrested for no reason. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" CNN's John Berman said .\n\n\"It is common in autocratic countries for journalists to be swept up in arrests during protests and riots, but rare in the United States, where news gathering is protected by the First Amendment,\" wrote the New York Times in response.\n\nIn fact, it's common in the United States, too. Just not necessarily if you work for CNN or the Times .\n\nIt was at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, with its police-enforced \" free speech zones ,\" that police attacked and ultimately arrested more than 1,800 journalists, protesters, legal observers, and even onlookers, leading to a record $18 million settlement from the city a decade later. In 2014, dozens of journalists were arrested and charged during protests against racist police murders. Two years later, Democracy Now 's Amy Goodman was arrested and charged with rioting for reporting on the pipeline protests at Standing Rock, where protesters were met with the same brutal, indiscriminate violence from authorities we're now seeing all over the country.\n\nAnd people already seem to have forgotten the J20 case that kicked off the Trump presidency, in which police rounded up two hundred people protesting on inauguration day in Washington, DC, including numerous journalists, and charged them with felony rioting simply for being in the vicinity of property damage, even if they themselves hadn't committed any of it. The prosecutor in that case, who had a lengthy history of misconduct , attempted to railroad the defendants and was ultimately sanctioned by the judge for leaving out exculpatory evidence, leading to an ongoing lawsuit against the city and its police force.\n\nIndeed, repression of first amendment rights by authorities - whether police, judges, or any others - is stunningly common at the local level, and just as arbitrary and tyrannical as what we're seeing now. As I wrote two and a half years ago, while fear of a homegrown American dictatorship often imagines a seizure of power at the top, it's more likely to come from \"the everyday authoritarian attitudes of, say, a neighborhood police officer, a local politician, even members of a suburban school board\" and others who \"hold private property rights supreme above all others, harbor quiet contempt for any form of public rebellion, and fetishize the importance of law and order.\"\n\nThis reality has been on full display this past week. Between the government response to these protests and Trump's reckless assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani at the start of the year, it's hard not to feel like the longtime warnings of civil libertarians are finally coming true.\n\nThen there's the overemphasis on Trump, typical of the last four years, in which prominent liberals and others have attempted to pin decades of bipartisan outrages on his election to the presidency.\n\n\"The world around us, in which the streets of every major American city are filled with protesters, is the result of Trump granting the wishes of the most retrograde police officers,\" Jonathan Chait wrote in reaction to the protests.\n\nOr as Andy Lassner, producer of the Ellen DeGeneres Show , put it in a since-deleted viral tweet: \"This is the America Putin hoped for when he backed Trump.\"\n\nThis is all pernicious nonsense. Minneapolis, where this all began, is a liberal city run by a Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, with a city council where Democrats control twelve of thirteen seats - the other is held by a Green Party member. A solid blue state, Democrats control its state house and the governor, Walz - who boasted of working with the military and the NSA to take on what he claimed was \"domestic terrorism\" and \"international destabilization,\" and accused the protests of being simply about \"attacking civil society\" - is a Democrat. Both he and Frey falsely claimed most of the protesters were from out of state, something they were forced to walk back , but not before commentators like MSNBC's Joy Reid jumped on it to cast the protests as a sinister tale of \"infiltration and deliberate mayhem.\"\n\nChicago, too, is a Democratic stronghold run by a supposedly liberal mayor. So is Washington, DC, the site of Monday night's Trump-driven police attack on protesters. So are cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Portland, Oregon. You'll find the same thing in many of the protest hot spots. Democratic-controlled and Republican-controlled states and cities alike didn't need Trump to tell them to \"dominate\" protesters, because they were already doing it, no matter how much shock and outrage they feign to the press about his comments. Outside of the capital , the violence protesters are facing is overwhelmingly at the hands of state and local governments. Yet looking at the media coverage, you'd be forgiven for thinking this is somehow all Trump.\n\nPoliticians, mostly Democratic ones, have become very adept at using the language of social justice, no longer mincing their words when it comes to condemning racism, and drawing from an impressive catalogue of eloquent phrases to show they really feel the struggle of being black in America. Ask them what specifically they'll do to stop police violence, however, and they'll give you a parade of pre-memorized lines about systemic racism and its history, but nothing concrete that actually answers the question. Just listen to billionaire Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker respond to a question about what he'll do to stop police murders in his own state, and see if you can spot an actual answer:\n\nThese are legitimate grievances . . . what happened to George Floyd unfortunately isn't unique. We all know of incidents - and thank God there was a camera there when George Floyd was murdered. This doesn't happen often enough - Ahmaud Arbery. It doesn't happen often enough that we get to actually see the racism being carried out and the police exceeding their authority. Look, it shouldn't be a death sentence in America to be black. Black families today and every day of these protests have been grieving. In fact, black families have been grieving for 400 years in this country because of the institutional racism. So throughout my term, and I've been in office for about a year and a half now, I've tried to address that with investments in communities that have been left out and left behind, by calling for police accountability and making sure that we're addressing the underlying issues of racism across our state.\n\nThe same goes for Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, who railed against Trump on All in With Chris Hayes last night, before seamlessly pivoting to defending the heinous conduct of her police during these protests. Democratic politicians have been getting away with all manner of travesties for years now by simply pointing at Trump, and they're not going to stop now. When they feed you lines about nebulous \"institutional racism,\" ask them, \"Which institution?\"\n\nThe squashing of dissent is a bipartisan tradition. Repression by police and other authorities happened regularly under Barack Obama, who oversaw such violence in numerous cities protesting police violence and Wall Street greed. He closed his presidency with the violent government assault on Standing Rock protesters, one that saw intense local and federal collaboration . As Alex S. Vitale has pointed out at the Guardian , the liberal police reforms Obama championed - from more police diversity and implicit bias training to body cameras and police-community dialogues - mattered little, given that the Minneapolis police department implemented them all, and they still choked out dozens of mostly black people with neck restraints until they got to George Floyd.\n\nChait blames the past week on Trump, because he rescinded Obama's restrictions on police requesting military equipment. This is wishful thinking of the most desperate kind. Even Obama's underlings who helped draw those up insist it was \"an incredibly limited list\" and that \"Obama never banned the acquisition of needed military equipment by state and local law enforcement.\" Indeed, at the time, numerous experts openly said the measure would have little to no effect and called it a \"publicity stunt,\" something confirmed by an In These Times investigation one year later, which found the Pentagon actually transferred $76 million more in equipment to local police departments the year after the measure was announced.\n\nThe idea that simply removing Trump and replacing him with a Democrat is going to meaningfully change any of this is a fantasy, and a dangerous one at that. Not only does it leave untouched the real, bipartisan origins of American authoritarianism, it allows well-meaning liberals to lull themselves into a false sense of security - particularly perilous when the man set to replace Trump is Joe Biden .\n\nHow has a party that's insisted for nearly four years that Trump is a dictator nevertheless continually handed him more power to spy? Because as this week's Democrat-led, highly militarized assault on protesters and journalists shows, the political elite is fundamentally in agreement about what the threat is.\n\nThough many powerful liberals are now comfortably fluent in the language of racial justice, they still prioritize values like unity and order over truth and justice. We've seen this firsthand in the liberal panic over the Kremlin's overblown role in \"sowing discord\" within the United States in years past, supposedly inflaming racial tensions by amplifying news about police murders and other forms of racism on social media - as if the ubiquitous media coverage they received needed any amplifying.\n\nThe implications of this line of thinking were both offensive and alarming: that African Americans needed a foreign power to spur them into outrage over racial injustice, and that the \"discord\" that erupted from this outrage - in the form of protests and other mass action - was dangerous and undesirable. This mindset never went away, as we saw this week with how quickly commentators accepted the idea that \"outside actors\" were to blame for nationwide protests, or the assertions by both conservatives like Marco Rubio and former Obama officials like Susan Rice that it was really \"the Russians\" behind it all. This conspiratorial, fearful mentality was finally made manifest in the violent repression we've witnessed for the past week.\n\nWe are in an uneasy place in history right now. Whether it's climate change, wealth inequality, or demilitarizing the police, the United States faces too many problems to count, problems that simply won't be solved without a mass movement fostering the kind of \"political revolution\" we once heard so much about. The forces arrayed against us don't intend to let that happen, and if their control over the political, economic, and media institutions doesn't suffice, it's become abundantly clear they're more than willing to treat their fellow citizens as enemy combatants and go to war. Today, it's a Republican president carrying out their will, but there are clearly more than enough Democrats champing at the bit to do the same.\n\nThese protests will subside at some point, and things might return to some form of normalcy. There's a good chance the bad man in the White House will go. And there may even be some reforms to police departments. But between the pandemic, impending climate disaster, and a shattered, criminally unjust economy, the decades ahead will be tumultuous. If the authoritarian outlook that has seeped into every level of American political life isn't dismantled, we may well look back on these events as a dress rehearsal for something even nastier.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "We're Living Through the Backlash\n\nRichard Tsong-Taatarii/Star-Tribune/AP\n\nTwo years ago today, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds .\n\nThe murder outraged the public, setting off a summer of pepper spray, rubber bullets, and torched police vehicles. It was a time of mourning and recrimination that also seemed to contain a real sense of possibility. People of all races, across the nation, joined rallies against police brutality. The Overton window seemed briefly to widen, with criminal justice advocates releasing wish lists of reforms that had previously been unthinkable. One of them became notorious: defunding the police.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers rushed to channel the energy of the protests into the upcoming elections. Conservative media figures thundered about lawlessness and warned their viewers that the dark-skinned figures on the screen would \"come for you.\" The left saw an opportunity for systemic change.\n\nBut for all the cries of the dangers of defunding the police, and of the radical agenda set off by the rage of two summers ago, we have not seen much concrete progress. In fact, we've often seen the opposite. Just as the radical edge of the 1960s sowed fear and spurred on the organization of a conservative movement- one that arose in the 1970s and attained full power in the next decade -we are again seeing the rise of a political force ruthlessly opposed to any attempt to create a different, more equal America.\n\nThat is to say, two years on, it's clear: The backlash has arrived.\n\nMeanwhile, many reforms floated in the wake of the protests have been tabled.\n\nIn one of her worst and most offensive gaffes , Nancy Pelosi thanked Floyd for \"sacrificing\" himself for the cause of \"justice.\" Floyd, of course, did not see himself as a martyr. He spent his last moments begging for his life. But implicit in the Democratic leader's remark was an assumption that his senseless murder would surely lead to some kind of reform.\n\nTwo years on, that reform is clear. It's so popular that politicians of both parties have united around it, even at a time of historic polarization: Funding the police .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has reportedly been held up by disagreements about qualified immunity , which can shield police officers and their departments from civil liability in misconduct cases, according to the Washington Post .\n\nThe White House announced the Floyd's family planned visit early Saturday.

      "text": "George Floyd Died of Asphyxia, Private Autopsy Finds\n\nA man kneels and holds up his fist at a memorial site where George Floyd died May 25 while in police custody, on June 1, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nUpdate 10am Tuesday: On Monday evening, the Hennepin County medical examiner released its full autopsy report on George Floyd. Unlike the county's preliminary findings, the manner of death was listed as homicide. But the cause differed from the asphyxia finding of the private autopsy and continued to place more blame on underlying health conditions than the actions of the police officers: \"Case of death: Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"\n\nTwo medical examiners hired by George Floyd's family announced Monday that the Minneapolis man died last week of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, rebutting the Hennepin County medical examiner's initial findings blaming Floyd's death on underlying health conditions.\n\n\"Not only was the knee on George's neck a cause of his death, but so was the weight of the other two police officers on his back, who not only prevented blood flow into his brain but also air flow,\" Antonio Romanucci, a lawyer for the family, said Monday. Only Derek Chauvin, the officer who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged in Floyd's death.\n\nFloyd's family hired Dr. Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan and Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, to determine the cause of death. Baden has previously conducted autopsies on Eric Garner, who died when police placed him in a chokehold in New York City in 2014, and like Floyd told officers he could not breathe, as well as Michael Brown, the 18-year-old black man shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri the same year. \"The autopsy shows that Mr. Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death,\" Baden said, according to the New York Times. \" This is confirmed by information provided to Dr. Wilson and myself by the family.\"\n\nThe findings lie in stark contrast to the Hennepin County medical examiner's initial conclusions, which seemed to absolve the officers of wrongdoing even as video evidence showed Floyd losing consciousness under their weight. \"The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,\" the criminal complaint filed by the state against Chauvin stated. \"Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\"\n\nVideo taken at the scene shows Floyd, a 46-year-old with a fit and slim physique, repeatedly claim he cannot breathe before losing consciousness and going limp, all while a police officer pressed a knee into his neck. When the county's autopsy findings are read alongside, they come off as a remarkable attempt at gaslighting: Who are you going to believe, the medical examiner or your lying eyes?\n\nThe county medical examiner's findings have been criticized by professionals beyond the team working with Floyd's family. \"I am extremely disappointed with, and pissed by the preliminary cause of death opinion of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner on the George Floyd case,\" medical examiner and frequent expert witness Bennet Omalu tweeted . \"Professional buffoonery at its best.\" In a short blog post, Omalu added that \"Human beings frequently die from asphyxial injury of the brain without any physical injury to the neck following compression of the neck\" and that despite any other contributing factors, \"the manner of death would be a homicide.\"\n\nNeither autopsy teams has released a final report. But it's hard to believe that Floyd would be dead today had multiple officers not pressed his neck and back onto the street pavement until he lost consciousness.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Minneapolis Votes to Keep Its Police Department\n\nA woman pays respect to George Floyd at a mural at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis. Julio Cortez/AP\n\nNearly a year and a half after a white Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, voters in the city have decided not to replace their police department with a new public safety agency that would have relied less on armed officers.\n\nFifty-seven percent of voters rejected the proposed Department of Public Safety, which would have likely included a smaller number of cops, along with unarmed social workers, violence interrupters, traffic safety responders, and homeless outreach coordinators who would have tried to prevent crimes by helping people access housing, jobs, education, and health care. The election was seen in some ways as a test case for the movement to reimagine public safety and reduce funding to traditional law enforcement.\n\n\"We all agree that we can't sustain as we are now with the way policing has been,\" Brian Herron, the pastor of a church on the city's North Side and an opponent of the ballot measure, told the New York Times . But he added that dismantling the police department made him nervous because he worried about crime. \"We don't have time to reimagine. We got bodies dropping in the streets. We got innocent folk being killed.\"\n\nThe question of whether to create the new public safety agency deeply divided the city: In one September poll , 49 percent of residents favored the ballot measure, while about 41 percent did not. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis in Congress, and Keith Ellison , the state attorney general, both supported the measure. Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith did not.\n\nVoters in Minneapolis are also deciding whether to reelect or replace Mayor Jacob Frey, who has faced intense pressure from progressive organizers over his stance on policing. Frey, a Democrat, also opposed the ballot measure to create the new public safety agency, arguing that the city could not safely reduce its police force at a time when gun violence has risen locally and around the country. The outcome of the mayoral race was not yet clear when the results of the public safety ballot measure were announced Tuesday night; 17 candidates are vying for the position.\n\nSince Floyd's death, Minneapolis has become a focal point in the national conversation around how to reimagine public safety, as progressive organizers across the country press officials to downsize or defund police departments. Hundreds of volunteers went door to door in Minneapolis to share information about their proposed Department of Public Safety, and out-of-state donors chipped in to the cause: The DC-based Open Society Policy Center, the lobbying arm of the Open Society Foundations founded by billionaire George Soros, gave Minneapolis organizers $500,000 for their canvassing.\n\nAlong with creating a new public safety agency, the ballot measure would have amended the city's charter, removing a provision that requires officials to fund a minimum number of police officers. Supporters of the measure wanted to make the number of cops more proportional to the percentage of 911 calls that require an armed response. A study last year of 10 cities around the country (not including Minneapolis) found that only about 1 percent of calls for police service were related to serious violent crimes. Other calls might instead be handled by substance abuse counselors, paramedics, or other medical workers.\n\nOpponents of the ballot measure worried that the public safety agency would leave communities more vulnerable to gun violence, which has surged during the pandemic. According to recent estimates from the FBI, homicides rose 30 percent last year across the country, largely because of shootings in under-resourced neighborhoods of color.\n\nIn Minneapolis, a group of residents on the North Side sued the city last year over police staffing, arguing there weren't enough officers to keep people safe. The pro-police group All of Mpls, led by Steve Cramer of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, raised more than $100,000 to campaign against the ballot measure. \"It is a major challenge,\" Steve Fletcher, a Minneapolis City Council member who supported the public safety agency, told me recently. \"Anytime you try to change the system of policing, the first time anything goes wrong, the first time there's a crime, there are people who point to that and say, 'You see, we need police.'\"\n\nBut the idea that ramping up police presence is the best way to improve public safety continues to be debated. As I recently explained in a piece debunking myths about crime , the uptick in shootings last year was widespread, including in municipalities led by Republicans that gave police departments more money.\n\nAnd in some ways, the fact that 43 percent of people voted to dismantle and replace the police department is a sign of shifting attitudes. \"While this is not the result that we hoped for, the story of our movement must be told,\" Corenia Smith, who helps lead Yes 4 Minneapolis, a coalition of activists that canvassed in support of the Department of Public Safety, said in a statement. \"We changed the conversation about what public safety should look like...Now we will work to hold leaders and the system accountable. We will work to heal our city and create safer streets for all our communities.\"\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How the George Floyd Uprising Was Framed for White Eyes\n\nBill Hudson/AP\n\nRamenda Cyrus June 10, 2021\n\nIn 1963, Walter Gadsden, 15 years old, was attacked by a police dog during a protest on the streets of Birmingham, Alabama. The moment was captured by Bill Hudson of the Associated Press. His photograph was later said to have brought the world to the side of the civil rights movement-a grand claim but not an unreasonable one, given both the photo's mass circulation and the meanings ascribed to it by white audiences.\n\nGadsden was a \"frail Negro,\" in one description; full of \"saintly calm,\" in the words of Diane McWhorter, paraphrasing the photographer's editor. The writer Paul Hemphill, in his memoir of growing up in Birmingham , saw a \"thin well-dressed boy seeming to be leaning into the dog, his arms limp at his side, calmly staring straight ahead as though to say, 'Take me, here I am.'\" Hudson's photo offered a drama of wholesome nonresistance, with Gadsden in the role of a martyred innocent.\n\nBut something was obscured in that narrative, as Martin Berger argues in Seeing Through Race: A Reinterpretation of Civil Rights Photography . The white gaze skipped right over the signs of Gadsden's resistance-the hand on the cop's arm, the left knee thrust into the dog's chest. These details did not fit with the prevailing picture of the struggle for civil rights. What white people saw instead was Black passivity. In Gadsden they saw a vulnerable boy who, like Black people throughout the South, was in need of white help. The photo may have drawn sympathetic white liberals to the cause of racial justice, but it did so, Berger writes, on terms that allowed them to feel secure and magnanimous, as if they were \"bestowing rights\" on Black people.\n\nIn May 2020, people again took to the streets, this time in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. Many things had changed since the day Hudson trained his lens on Gadsden. The Black Lives Matter movement enjoyed broader support than the civil rights movement did in its time, and the media documenting the uprising was no longer so monochromatically white.\n\nBut were things really all that different? I looked at front pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post during the hectic early days of the protests and saw several familiar tropes, marshaled in familiar ways. The visual portrayal of the uprising was operating within the same boundaries established by well-meaning but ultimately self-interested white liberals during the civil rights era. Now as then, it seemed, the principal concern was to channel and validate white response to Black rebellion in the streets.\n\nA Black person at the mercy of a white person or the state was a familiar image during the civil rights movement. Think of the photos of lunch counter sit-ins where white people screamed Black people down, or the photos of water hoses turned on kids during the Children's Crusade in 1963. Today, \"passive\" Black people may have their hands in the air, or perhaps they are being carted away by police in riot gear. For white audiences, these photos stamp innocence onto Black people, thus translating the protest into an acceptable cause. In this image from the May 30 Washington Post , a Black man kneels with his fists raised. Black viewers have tended to read photographs like this one as \"images of power,\" Berger tells me in an email. \"After all, it takes strength to calmly confront militarized police to make one's principled point.\" On the front page of an establishment newspaper, however, different meanings more readily assert themselves. The man's hands in the air represent the compliance demanded by the state, as embodied by the indistinct armed figures in the distance. The primary colors lock in the gaze, and the longer you linger, the more you might feel as if he is offering up his body, just as Walter Gadsden seemed to. The viewer is invited to appreciate the man's ironclad will, his brave forbearance; the viewer is not implored to consider the desperation and anger it might have taken to put himself in that position in the first place. Front page photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters The Rioter Photos from the urban uprisings of the late 1960s presented a different image of Black protest. Black people were now \"forceful figures,\" Berger says. They were no longer protesters; they were rioters. Media coverage tended to focus on the aftermath of riots, reinforcing white discomfort and solidifying resistance to anything other than a \"peaceful\" protest. The person depicted here could be of any race; all the viewer registers is the dark figure-\"literally black,\" says Michael Shaw, publisher of Reading the Pictures , a website dedicated to analyzing the visual framing of social issues-silhouetted against a backdrop of destruction. \"You can see that this generation and so much of the images that come out of this are forceful, are pushing back upon that authority, where the images beforehand were pulling for that sympathy,\" says Brent Lewis, a Black photo editor at the New York Times and the co-founder of Diversify Photo , a site promoting the work of nonwhite photographers. Shaw was put in mind of \"war photography,\" calling it \"a very toxic photograph, very loaded.\" The accompanying headline, \"spreading unrest leaves a nation on edge,\" only furthers the sense of anxiety. Of course not everyone was on edge in that moment-what of the people who felt a sense of joy and liberation watching Minneapolis' Third Precinct burn down?-but the assumptions embedded in the presentation give a sense of the upper bound of the liberal establishment's sympathy with the cause. Yet, while the riot photos may have evoked the imagery of the late 1960s, Berger points out that they were not received in the same way: \"Millions of whites in the 21st century were able to look at these images of powerful Black actors without losing their sympathy or pulling back\" from the cause. Front page photo: Victor J. Blue/New York Times/Redux The Crowd Large, diverse crowds were irresistible subjects of last year's protest coverage. \"There's a kind of anonymity to them and a redundancy,\" Shaw says. The protesters are always squeezed into the frame, suggesting a crowd bursting at the edges, and signage is usually prominently featured. The mildness of these images reassures white viewers that the protests are peaceful while also communicating the scale of both the problem and the resistance to it. Berger notes the Black marchers holding up cell phones in the crowd shots-\"individuals who have taken charge of their self-representation...no longer reliant on the white press to get their stories out.\" Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP In this package from the June 16, 2020, Washington Post , Shaw sees \"an interesting juxtaposition where you get a dialogue between the photographs.\" The allusions to the civil rights era in the crowd shot-the \"I AM A MAN\" sign, with \"KING\" in the distance-are paired with the intimate portrait of Rayshard Brooks' family, as if history itself were beckoning the viewer to come to the rescue of Black humanity. Front page photo: Dustin Chambers/Getty Good Versus Evil These photos are from different protests, yet they were placed together on the New York Times' June 1 front page. Good vs. evil is the narrative. Note the ominous, depersonalized image of the police, portrayed like an alien invasion against the unarmed, white-presenting demonstrators in the streets of Brooklyn. As with the images from the 1960s, it's clear who the bad guys are supposed to be. White viewers are thus reassured that they are not complicit. The conflict, in the package's telling, is about the cops and the violence they inflict on Black people-true enough but only part of the story. \"Many millions of liberal whites have no problem seeing the problem of race as one of violent police,\" Berger says. \"That allows them to distance themselves from racism, since they can't imagine themselves perpetrating white-on-Black violence. White outrage at police conduct downplays their complicity in a racialized system that benefits whites.\" Until white people examine how they can be participants in a movement against police brutality and still receive racism's dividends, America will keep spinning in circles. In the early days of the uprising, the action in the streets challenged the white response. The front pages of the country's establishment newspapers seemed to coddle it. Front page photo: Victor J.

      "text": "An Inside Look at Weeks of Demonstrations Following the Killing of George Floyd\n\nKatie Orlinsky June 23, 2020\n\nKatie Orlinsky\n\nTo someone who grew up in New York City, the NYPD will always be synonymous with Amadou Diallo. One of the first protests I ever attended was at City Hall in 2000, after the police officers who shot at Diallo 41 times were acquitted and the city erupted in anger. His killing solidified and reaffirmed a generation of New Yorkers' understanding of who the police really were, who they served and protected, and who they did not.\n\nPeople called for change, and politicians promised that the police would be reformed. Instead billions of dollars flowed into the NYPD as they racially profiled countless youth through stop and frisk, shot at Sean Bell 50 times, choked Eric Garner to death, and denied justice to the family members of Delrawn Small, Elvin Diaz, Ramarley Graham, Jayson Tirado, Mohamed Bah, Shantel Davis, Iman Morales, Kimani Gray, Alberta Spruill, and Rexford Dasrath-all men and women who have been killed by the NYPD over the past 15 years. Year after year, from New York to Missouri, police continue to kill Black and Brown people with impunity, all while serving as the most powerful apparatus of racist violence in the United States.\n\nAfter the killing of George Floyd, 25 days (and counting) in New York City have been marked by hundreds of protests and marches that have spread out across so many neighborhoods it seems like they might reach every person in the city. Young people, around the same age Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown would have been if they were alive today, are leading marches with confidence and strength. Older residents and young children stand outside their stoops and windows cheering from a safe distance, thanking them for putting themselves on the line. Just a month ago, the hospitals were overflowing. So many lives were lost, and just as with police violence, the victims have been disproportionately Black and Brown.\n\nSome of the protests are enormous and others are small, some are joyful and others mournful, some are run like campaign events organized by local politicians and others more like DIY actions scraped together by high school kids. What they all have in common is their power-the way people are feeling it, and the way people are showing it. This is a movement, not a series of protests, and within weeks it has already put politicians on the defensive, pressuring them to enact reforms that have been long overdue. And still, the movement knows that this is not enough, and it is not backing down.\n\nFloyd's killing is infuriatingly nothing new or different. But the outrage, activism, and protest it has inspired, the Black Lives Matter movement's spread and influence, the calls to defund and abolish the police that are going beyond more of the same placating reforms, and the momentum of a movement that simply will not stop-all this is new. From my one small lens in this great big city, this time feels different.\n\nMothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers of men and women killed by the NYPD march past City Hall in Manhattan on June 9. In the corner of their banner it reads #repeal50a, something they have fought for over decades. New York Civil Rights Law section 50-A has kept police officers' disciplinary records secret for the past 44 years, hiding misconduct and excessive force complaints from the public, the press, and even attorneys, helping to ensure unfit officers would remain on the street. The New York legislature voted to repeal 50-A the day after this protest, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure two days later.\n\nA member of the activist collective Warriors in the Garden in Washington Square Park on June 4.\n\n\"I AM BLACK AND MY LIFE MATTERS\" is written on Precious Edwards' face shield at the June 13 Black Excellence March in Brooklyn.\n\nOfficers line up on the third day of protests in New York City, on May 30 in Flatbush, Brooklyn. That night saw some of the most intense encounters between police and protesters that have taken place in recent New York history, with officers spraying tear gas, arresting and beating demonstrators, while protesters threw bottles and set several NYPD vehicles on fire.\n\nProtesters fill the streets outside the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn on June 2.\n\nA rally in the Bronx, organized by the Bronx Justice Center and the party for Socialism and Liberation, on June 3.\n\nTiffany Tores, a dancer from the Bronx, is comforted by a friend during nine minutes of silence observed in honor of George Floyd and the many other Black men and women killed by police. (It signifies the approximate amount of time police officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck, resulting in Floyd's death.) This moment of quiet reflection marked the end of a joyful \"Dance for George\" protest in Harlem on June 7.\n\nProtesters in Flatbush, Brooklyn, embrace on May 30.\n\nA march in Brooklyn on May 31. This massive, peaceful protest was overshadowed by the destruction and looting of stores that took place later that evening in Manhattan.\n\nAs NYPD officers arrest a protester on May 31, the protest stops to surround the officers and demand their release, which was unsuccessful.\n\nMore of the intense scene on May 30, in Flatbush, Brooklyn.\n\nFirefighters work to put out a NYPD car that was lit on fire during protests on May 30 in Brooklyn.\n\nA candlelight vigil for George Floyd in Queens on June 1.\n\nProtesters stayed at a June 6 candlelight vigil after curfew at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn.\n\nOne demonstrator at the June 3 rally in the Bronx, organized by the Bronx Justice Center and the party for Socialism and Liberation.\n\nAs a march passes through Brooklyn on June 2, children stand on their vehicles to join the protest.\n\nProtesters in the street on May 30, in Flatbush, Brooklyn.\n\nA young girl holds a sign and cheers as the bikers pass along Eastern Parkway on June 12.\n\nAn onlooker joins in with the chant \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" as a march passes by in Brooklyn on June 2.\n\nDemonstrators in Brooklyn on May 31.\n\nA march in Bed Stuy stops outside the local NYPD precinct to make speeches on June 1.\n\nRoughly 10,000 people gathered in Brooklyn for the Black Trans Lives Matter rally on June 14, in the wake of the killings of Dominique \"Rem'mie\" Fells and Riah Milton, two Black trans women.\n\nA march makes its way through Bed Stuy on June 1.\n\nProtesters do the electric slide at the \"Dance for George\" protest in Harlem on June 7. The march and protest brought the New York City dance community together to demonstrate their support of the Black Lives Matter movement and to speak out against racism, police brutality, and the killing of George Floyd.\n\nA Khutbah prayer protest is held on June 5 outside the Barclay's Center.\n\nA candlelight vigil for George Floyd in Queens on June 1.\n\nThe aftermath of the June 3 rally organized by the Bronx Justice Center and the party for Socialism and Liberation.\n\nProtesters remain at the Barclay's Center after curfew on June 6 to take a knee for roughly 9 minutes.\n\nA man holds an image of George Floyd atop a statue in Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn during a Juneteenth rally.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Few Cops We Found Using Force on George Floyd Protesters Are Known to Have Faced Discipline\n\nJason Redmond / AFP/Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica , a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for the Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nLast summer, ProPublica compiled 68 videos that appeared to show police officers using disproportionate force against protesters during the nationwide events following George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\nWe had culled the videos from hundreds circulating on social media in the wake of the protests and highlighted the cases that seemed to clearly show officers using disproportionate force. We then reached out to dozens of law enforcement agencies whose officers are in the videos and asked some straightforward questions: Have the officers' police departments investigated the incidents? And what consequences, if any, have the officers in the videos faced?\n\nAs time passed, we've been checking in with the departments to get their answers.\n\nAfter a year, we wanted to give a final update on what we know: Departments have disclosed discipline for 10 officers.\n\nA Seattle Police Department officer received a written reprimand for striking a protester with \"six to eight punches over six seconds.\" In Grand Rapids, Michigan, an officer shot a man in the shoulder at close range with a long-range tear gas round. He received two days without pay. In Salt Lake City, an officer received \" coaching and counseling \" for using a shield to push an elderly man.\n\nSix officers were initially fired, though two got their jobs back after a review. Criminal charges are also pending against 11 officers, including some who have already faced internal discipline.\n\nIn 17 cases that we followed, the departments have decided not to discipline the officers or could not identify them.\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing in 25 of the cases. This includes a high-profile case in Buffalo, New York, where two officers pushed a man backward , causing him to hit his head on the pavement. A grand jury dismissed felony assault charges against the officers, but a decision on departmental discipline is still pending.\n\nFinally, in 18 instances, ProPublica could not determine the disciplinary outcome - either because the department did not respond or the department said it could not share the information.\n\nThe weaving journey of accountability has played out starkly around one of the cases in Atlanta.\n\nIn May 2020, the mayor announced the firing of two officers just a day after they were involved in the violent arrest of two college students who were pulled from a car.\n\nBut the officers quickly sued to get their jobs back, citing a lack of due process. In February, Atlanta's Civil Service Board agreed. The two officers are once again employed by the department but remain on administrative leave. The incident remains under investigation. Criminal charges have also been filed against the officers , including assault, though the district attorney who brought them has since been voted out of office.\n\nOne reason departments have declined to comment on the status of cases is that the incidents have been subject to litigation. But the back and forth on such suits can be illuminating.\n\nResponding to a lawsuit by a protester who was hit by a Los Angeles Police Department vehicle, the city wrote that the \"force used against plaintiff, if any, was caused and necessitated by the actions of plaintiff, and was reasonable and necessary for self-defense.\"\n\nIn about half of the cases we reviewed, including one resulting in discipline, the officer or officers involved have not been publicly identified. Sometimes, it's not even clear which law enforcement agency they worked for.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where Floyd's death occurred, sparking outrage across the world, a video captured the moment in May when officers patrolling a neighborhood fired paint rounds at a woman's home while enforcing a curfew.\n\nA Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told ProPublica the agency was \"not involved\" in the incident. The Minneapolis Police Department said the incident was \"not our agency.\" The Minnesota State Patrol said that it reviewed the video of the incident, and that \"the officer who fired the marking round was not a State Patrol trooper.\" When asked which agency the officers who fired the paint round were from, the spokesperson said it was \"unclear.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Police Unions Have Enormous War Chests to Defend Officers Like Derek Chauvin\n\nRichard Tsong-Taatarii/AP\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former officer who was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after he kneeled on George Floyd's neck last May, faces a criminal trial that's scheduled to begin this month. The city of Minneapolis won't be paying his legal fees: Cops accused of crimes are typically on the hook for their attorney costs and other related expenses.\n\nBut that's not a problem for Chauvin. He turned to the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, a statewide group with hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside in a legal defense fund to pay for cops' legal costs. It's available to more than 10,000 law enforcement officers around Minnesota, including the three other ex-officers involved in Floyd's death.\n\nPolice officers around the country can tap into similarly immense war chests to cover hefty expenses if they're prosecuted for killing or injuring someone-resources that critics say give them an unfair advantage and make it easier for them to avoid guilty verdicts. Officers typically receive the benefit as part of their membership in police unions. They pay monthly or annual fees and then have access to this club of sorts and its financial resources. If they kill someone on the job, they call up the association and get connected with defense attorneys who can give them advice and guide them through the courts if they're prosecuted.\n\n\"It's part of a broader system that shields officers who commit misconduct from accountability,\" says Samuel Sinyangwe, a data scientist who studies police unions for the nonprofit project Campaign Zero.\n\n\"These funds and the unions continue to push the narrative that law enforcement are the victims, not the perpetrators, no matter how much objective evidence you have,\" says Ben Crump, an attorney who represents Floyd's family and has worked on other high-profile cases alleging police brutality.\n\nMinnesota's police Legal Defense Fund is one of many such funds around the country. The biggest and oldest, under the Peace Officers Research Association of California , has tens of millions of dollars at its disposal that it offers to cops nationwide. More than 135,000 law enforcement officers in all 50 states are members of its Legal Defense Fund, which holds a whopping $39 million in reserves , up from $18 million in 2015, mostly accumulated from membership fees. And there's no cap on how much the association will pay in court-it has spent $170 million defending law enforcement officers since 2007.\n\n\"Whether the case costs $100,000 or $1,000,000 to defend, we keep our long-standing promise of never skimping when our members' lives and careers are on the line,\" the association's president, Brian Marvel, a police officer in San Diego, wrote in March. (As of December, the fund was assisting officers in 129 active criminal cases , many of them for on-duty shootings.)\n\nAnother national fund, the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, operates like a charity, which means officers don't need to be part of a union or pay fees to benefit from its financial assistance, which totaled $319,654 for legal cases in 2019. Several cops involved in high-profile killings have sought help from the LELDF, including the Baltimore officers who were acquitted after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray; the former Atlanta officer who killed Rayshard Brooks outside a Wendy's last summer, whose attorney has asked a court to dismiss the criminal case against him; the former Forth Worth officer who fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson in 2019 while she was at home with her eight-year-old nephew, whose trial is tentatively set for later this year; and the former officer in Maryland who received a pardon from Donald Trump in December after spending a decade in prison for a brutality case related to her K-9.\n\nAttorney costs can quickly rack up because some of these court cases drag on for years: With financial resources from LELDF, Joseph Weekley , the officer who fatally shot seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones while she slept on a couch in Detroit in 2010, survived two hung juries before a prosecutor ultimately dismissed the charges against him five years later.\n\nCivilians in other types of jobs, even if they're part of unions, might have access to arbitration if they're fired, but their labor associations typically won't cover their court expenses if they're accused of a crime. Some police officers say it makes sense for their unions to build up legal defense funds, even though other types of unions don't, because their profession requires them to enter situations where they may need to use force, putting them at greater risk of being sued or prosecuted. The goal, says Jason Johnson, a former deputy police commissioner in Baltimore who is now president of the LELDF, is to ensure everyone is afforded due process. \"All we're trying to do is to prevent law enforcement officers from having to choose between being able to feed their family and children and being able to be adequately represented in court,\" he says. \"It doesn't change the calculus on holding officers accountable.\"\n\nYet it's extremely rare for cops to be convicted of crimes after shooting or killing someone-in part because of lenient use-of-force laws , and in part because prosecutors and grand juries rarely indict them. Activists argue the legal defense funds tip the scale further in their favor. As Timothy Belcher, a labor attorney in Vermont, puts it: \"It adds another layer to the story of how these cops are basically untouchable legally.\"\n\nThis arrangement can be problematic for another reason: Some of the associations running the legal defense funds also donate heavily to district attorney candidates who are then tasked with deciding whether to bring charges against officers. \"There's a conflict of interest if prosecutors take money from police unions and then face off against police-union-funded [defense] advocates in court,\" says Maxwell Szabo, an attorney who formerly worked as a spokesperson in the San Francisco DA's office.\n\nThe Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC), which manages the country's biggest, multimillion-dollar defense fund for police, regularly spends money supporting prosecutor candidates in their elections across California. In 2013, it gave at least $3,000 to Sacramento DA Anne Marie Schubert, who six years later decided not to press charges against the officers who shot Stephon Clark while he was standing in his grandparents' backyard with a cellphone in his hand. Given that PORAC is based in Sacramento and has a board member who works for Sacramento's Police Officers Association, it's possible the group also helped the officers pay for their defense attorneys. PORAC declined an interview request from Mother Jones .\n\nJohnson , the former Baltimore deputy police commissioner who leads the charitable LELDF, which does not support political candidates, says police unions are entitled to get involved with political campaigns that will affect their members' professions. Other unions do that, too. \"I don't see a conflict of interest,\" he says.\n\nMore recently, PORAC gave at least $724,000 to try to defeat reformist Los Angeles DA George Gascón , who campaigned last year on a platform of holding cops accountable in a county that sees more law enforcement shootings than almost anywhere else in the country. \"Gascón and his ilk look at you as criminals and not the guardians you are,\" Marvel wrote to his police colleagues in a January newsletter , adding that he hoped the newly elected prosecutor would be recalled. Though Marvel's association lost that race, it has succeeded enormously at lobbying against police reforms at the California statehouse, working alongside other law enforcement unions and associations. \"We need to make 'defund the police' a toxic phrase for elected officials,\" Marvel added in the newsletter.\n\nHis organization has the money to do it. California police unions and associations spent $2 million for lobbyists to influence state legislation in 2017-nine times more than the NRA spent on lobbyists that year, according to an analysis by Sinyangwe's Campaign Zero. And of that, PORAC contributed nearly a quarter. It spent another $1.6 million on political campaign donations from 2011 to 2017. \"They are the single largest and most influential group within the police association orbit,\" says Sinyangwe. He adds that PORAC and police unions often donate heavily to state lawmakers who they hope will oppose or water down police-reform laws, including ones dealing with use of force.\n\nAt the federal level, Marvel testified in front of the nonpartisan commission established by Trump in 2019 to study ways of improving policing in America. (The commission was later found to have violated the law because it was composed solely of law enforcement representatives and no civil rights activists, academics, or defense attorneys.) \"[T]he issue of police reform is sure to remain salient under the Biden administration. As those conversations continue, PORAC will be there, ensuring that the voices of California law enforcement officers are at the table,\" legal analysts wrote in the association's January 2021 newsletter . They added that the association opposes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which Democrats in Congress are pushing as a way to reduce police violence.\n\nWhile members of PORAC and other police legal defense organizations are forthright about their disdain for the defund-police movement inspired by Floyd's death, most have condemned his killing. \"Officer Chauvin, he betrayed the badge,\" Brian Peters, executive director of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which is paying for Chauvin's defense, told CBS's Gayle King in a recent interview . (His association declined to speak with Mother Jones .)\n\n\"A vast majority of peace officers around the nation, including PORAC, were shocked and saddened by what we saw on that video,\" Marvel wrote in July 2020, referring to the video footage of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. PORAC's vice president wrote last summer that it was a \"gross exaggeration\" to suggest \"there is an epidemic of police brutality,\" but that \"it goes without saying that we as law enforcement officers condemn what occurred.\"\n\nBut that doesn't detract from their desire to provide a proper defense for the four officers now facing prosecution for Floyd's death. \"Every citizen has a right to due process, and it just has to play out,\" Peters told King. When asked what would be a fair outcome in Chauvin's case, he added, \"Is there a fair outcome? I don't think there is.\"\n\nChauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. His attorney, Eric Nelson, is expected to argue that Floyd died because of underlying health problems and drug use, though an autopsy report concluded Floyd died in a homicide; his heart failed after Chauvin restrained him on the ground. Last Friday, the city of Minneapolis announced it would pay Floyd's family $27 million after the family filed a civil lawsuit-one of the largest pretrial settlements in US history for an alleged wrongful death at the hands of police.\n\nOn Monday, Chauvin's attorney asked the judge overseeing the criminal case to delay the trial , because he argued the settlement could bias jury members. The judge began recalling previously selected jurors to question them about it. It's unclear how many weeks or months the jury selection and other court hearings will drag on. But one thing is certain: However long the trial lasts, Chauvin will likely be able to afford it.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin's Colleagues Found Guilty of Violating George Floyd's Civil Rights\n\nMinneapolis Police Officers Thomas Lane, left, and J. Alexander Kueng, right, escorting George Floyd, center, to a police vehicle in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Court TV via AP, Pool, File\n\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were convicted on Thursday of federal charges that they violated George Floyd's civil rights when they did not stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from murdering him.\n\nWhile Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for almost nine and a half minutes , J. Alexander Kueng, a rookie cop, knelt on Floyd's back. Another rookie, Thomas Lane, held Floyd's legs down. A third officer, Tou Thao, kept bystanders back as they expressed concern that Floyd could not breathe.\n\nDuring the roughly four-week trial, prosecutors accused two of the former officers, Kueng and Thao, of violating Floyd's civil rights by deliberately failing to intervene against Chauvin's violence. Prosecutors also accused all three former officers of violating Floyd's civil rights by failing to provide him with proper medical care, even after he lost consciousness. \"These defendants knew what was happening, and contrary to their training, contrary to common sense, contrary to basic human decency, they did nothing to stop Derek Chauvin, did nothing to help George Floyd,\" prosecutor Manda Sertich told jurors during closing arguments.\n\nAfter 13 hours of deliberation, a jury convicted the former officers on each count. The jury also found that the officers' actions-and lack of action-resulted in Floyd's death, a determination that could lead to higher prison sentences.\n\nPolicing experts said the jury's decision to convict could set a precedent involving the extent to which police must rein in the bad behavior of colleagues. \"This might be a rare occasion where a criminal prosecution will have an inordinate impact on how officers think about their jobs and how agencies think about their responsibilities,\" Georgetown Law Professor Christy Lopez, who spent years investigating police misconduct for the Department of Justice, told me last week .\n\n\"A guilty verdict could help spark a change in police culture and training,\" added Josh Parker, an attorney at the NYU School of Law's Policing Project.\n\nThe former Minneapolis officers each took the stand in their defense. They repeatedly blamed the Minneapolis Police Department for providing inadequate training, and for teaching them to follow orders from superiors like Chauvin, who was the most senior officer on the scene. \"I think I would trust a 19-year veteran to figure it out,\" Thao testified , explaining why he did not ask Chauvin to get off Floyd.\n\nKueng, who had been on the job only a few days, testified that field training officers like Chauvin served as a \"role model,\" and that his own training barely included any mention of a duty to intervene. (Policing experts Lopez and Parker said the trial was the first time they'd ever seen federal prosecutors charge lower-ranking officers of failing to intervene against a superior.)\n\nBecause the three former officers were found guilty of civil rights violations that resulted in Floyd's death, they could potentially face life in prison-or even the death penalty-although such severe sentences are exceedingly rare for these offenses.\n\nChauvin was convicted last April of murder and manslaughter in a state criminal trial and sentenced to about 22 years in prison. He pleaded guilty in December to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights. Kueng, Lane and Thao also face a June trial on state charges of aiding and abetting murder.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Elon Musk and Ben Shapiro want Trump to pardon George Floyd's murderer\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nShortly after the video of George Floyd's death went viral in May 2020, a popular conservative pundit released an online video in which he decried Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for kneeling on Floyd for \"four straight minutes,\" even though Floyd, bystanders and even other police officers told Chauvin that Floyd couldn't breathe.\n\nThis pundit pointed to video of the incident to dismiss the argument that Floyd was resisting arrest. It's \"really ugly and really bad,\" he said, adding that Chauvin should be prosecuted \"to the fullest extent of the law\" and should \"go to jail\" and that \"everyone should be on the same side of this.\" Several days later, the same pundit wrote in his syndicated column that Floyd's death at the hands of Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers should inspire Americans to \"rally\" against such \"obvious evil.\"\n\nThat pundit was the Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro. This week, Shapiro called on Donald Trump to pardon Chauvin on the federal charges he faced for causing Floyd's death.\n\nEven as he condemned Chauvin's brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters.\n\nAs you might have guessed, I've left out some important context to Shapiro's 2020 condemnation of Chauvin's brutality. The problem is that the context doesn't help - it makes it all a lot worse. Even as he condemned Chauvin's brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters for claiming that what Chauvin did was commonplace or racially motivated. He chastised critics who argued that police brutality is systemic. George Floyd's killer would be prosecuted, Shapiro promised, and that would prove the system works.\n\nShapiro seemed particularly offended at the very idea that other police officers or conservatives like him would defend Chauvin. Everyone condemned Chauvin's actions, he assured us - from him to police groups around the country to President Donald Trump. The mere fact that so many people on the right had condemned a white cop for killing a Black man was, he argued, in and of itself proof that systemic racism is a myth.\n\nWhat a difference five years makes. Now Shapiro claims that Chauvin's trial was a farce and that his \"conviction represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive, and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.\" Other conservative commentators and politicians have also come to Chauvin's defense , but Shapiro's plea achieved particular significance after it was amplified by Elon Musk , Trump's unofficial co-president and his largest campaign donor.\n\nThat conservative pundits like Shapiro now defend Chauvin isn't surprising. It follows a familiar pattern after high-profile incidents of police brutality spark large protests. Those protests are rarely only about the precipitating incident itself. They tend to happen in places with long-established police abuse and racism. And as the 2023 Justice Department report documented , there was plenty of both at the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nThe campaign to retroactively exonerate Chauvin and reverse the progress made by George Floyd protests began with a video produced and co-written by a former TV host who is married to the former head of the Minneapolis police union . It was then distributed by a far-right advocacy group that poses as a news organization. Among other risible claims, the documentary accuses the FBI of pressuring Minneapolis officials to manufacture evidence to implicate Chauvin. You know the FBI. Always looking for reasons to smear cops.\n\nNevertheless, the documentary slowly gained purchase in online right-wing culture, first with MAGA influencers on social media, then with far-right personalities like Megan Kelly and Tucker Carlson and finally with more mainstream, \"heterodox\" and right-of-center podcasts and publications .\n\nAs with most lies perpetuated by the far right, the truth is there for those who want it. In a long three-part series , I documented in detail how its producers duped gullible pundits and columnists into amplifying claims that were false, misleading or wholly made-up. But as is also the case with far-right mythology, the true believers aren't interested in reality. They want validation. So the \"documentary\" is now MAGA canon.\n\nShapiro's demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It's purely symbolic.\n\nThe video depicting George Floyd's murder hasn't changed in five years. It's as harrowing as ever. Bystanders, other police officers and Floyd himself plead with Chauvin. They tell him Floyd isn't breathing. They cry out to Chauvin that Floyd doesn't have a pulse. Chauvin callously ignores them. And George Floyd dies.\n\nWhat has changed is the right's posture toward racism and political violence. The gutter politics of people like Laura Loomer, Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Nick Fuentes is now part of the Republican Party's core. People who were too racist for the first Trump administration have been rehired or promoted in the second. It's now acceptable to tell vicious lies about immigrant groups like the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, to Venezuelans in Aurora, Colorado . Pizzagate propagator Jack Posobiec now advises Trump Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and accompanies them on official trips . The sitting vice president wrote the foreword to Posobiec's book - a book in which, right in the title, Posobiec declares his political enemies to be \"unhuman.\"\n\nDonald Trump has always valorized political violence. He has spent the last decade dehumanizing immigrants, defending police brutality, celebrating the violent suppression of dissent and boasting about the bikers, soldiers and cops waiting to spill blood on his behalf should he ever need them ( as they already have ).\n\nThe political right has now fully embraced that ethos. When Kyle Rittenhouse lugged his guns into a volatile protest zone and killed two people, those deaths were treated not as tragic but as legally justified. They were celebrated . A year after Daniel Perry was convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pardoned him at the urging of right-wing voices like Tucker Carlson. And when, in one of Trump's first acts after his inauguration, he granted clemency to the Jan. 6 rioters , including those who violently attacked Capitol Police officers, those on the right praised the pardons and commutations.\n\nShapiro himself acknowledges that Trump can pardon Chauvin only on the federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights. The more serious charges came in state court, where Trump has no clemency power.\n\nThis means Shapiro's demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It's purely symbolic: Shapiro wants validation for his argument that Chauvin was wrongly convicted. He wants the president to refute the notion that Shapiro himself advanced in 2020: that Chauvin's treatment of George Floyd was \"really ugly and really bad\" and \"obviously evil.\"\n\nWhen we contrast the two Ben Shapiros, five years apart, the right's grim trajectory over that time comes into focus. The 2020 Ben Shapiro argued that the right's near-universal condemnation of Chauvin was proof that his side takes police brutality seriously, that its support for the prosecution of a white cop for killing an unarmed Black man was proof that it isn't racist and that Chauvin's inevitable prosecution was proof of its belief that the criminal justice system is fair and just. The 2025 Ben Shapiro - along with much of the right - now says that Chauvin's killing of Floyd was justified, that his prosecution should never have happened and that his conviction was political and vindictive.\n\nHowever flawed his arguments, the 2020 Ben Shapiro was at least eager to defend the right from claims that it is racist, oblivious to injustice or eager to embrace violence. The 2025 Ben Shapiro seems hell-bent on proving him wrong.\n\nCORRECTION (March 26, 2025, 8:10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the first name of a podcast host.

Reflecting on George Floyd and Jordan Neely.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nThree years. Six minutes.\n\nThese are the numbers on my mind as I reflect on the killings of George Floyd and Jordan Neely , two distinct yet eerily similar instances of Black death that put Americans - particularly, white Americans - in focus.\n\nThree years have now passed since Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, in a filmed killing that ignited racial justice protests. The amount of time that police officer Derek Chauvin spent kneeling on Floyd's neck - around nine minutes - reflected the cruelty required for someone to commit such an act, as in: How could someone spend nine whole minutes crushing another being to death?\n\nAt the time, many thought that the gruesome nature of Floyd's death would spur white America into anti-racist action. But while important social justice gains have been made in Floyd's name in the three years since, the wave of white empathy seems to have hit a wall.\n\nCorporate leaders have been exposed for their empty promises of racial equity , federal legislation designed to prevent police misconduct has faltered , and, anecdotally speaking, a lot of white folks seem to have lost their capacity for anti-racist outrage.\n\nComplicity and complacency require much less effort.\n\nI think that's how we arrive at what I feel has been a rather muted reaction to the behavior of Daniel Penny, who is charged with manslaughter after holding another New York subway rider, Jordan Neely, in a chokehold that reportedly was about six minutes longer than Chauvin knelt on Floyd. Penny's lawyers claim he was acting in self-defense and never intended harm.\n\nAs I wrote earlier this month , many news outlets' framing of the incident seems to indicate a disturbing level of acceptance for the possibility that a white man could have reason to choke or crush a Black man until he dies.\n\nI don't think it's particularly useful to try to rank acts of violence by their grotesqueness. So I won't try to decide which is more galling - death by white officer or death by white civilian.\n\nBut I do think the three years separating the killings of George Floyd and Jordan Neely speak to an enduring belief that Black people must be policed in public. And, to me, the support for Penny just shows that people are willing to assign those responsibilities to everyday citizens, who may be even more brutal than officers themselves.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

People come from all directions: holding signs, wearing masks. It's quiet, considering the size of the crowd. The day after George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police, the space that will become George Floyd Square is blocked off by some kind of red ribbon, twisted through the doors and windows of a barricade of cars. Flowers mark the spot on the sidewalk where he died. In the days to come, the flowers multiply and other forms of memorial emerge: vigils, murals, billboards, portraits. In the 12 months since Floyd's murder, community members have continued to occupy and preserve George Floyd Square.

The trial has produced no made-for-television stunts or rhetorical flourishes. There's no bloody glove, no rhyming couplets. Chauvin's defense is so basic that an attorney straight out of law school could pull it off. His lawyers are simply arguing that cops have the right to kill people, if they think they need to. That strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye. After all, there is incontrovertible video evidence that Chauvin did not \"need\" to kill George Floyd. The video shows that Floyd posed no threat to the police or anybody else: He was prone and handcuffed while Chauvin slowly choked the life out of him over the course of eight minutes and 46 seconds. Any reasonable human being can see that Chauvin should have taken his knee off of Floyd's neck. But the defense lawyers know that the law does not require Chauvin to behave like a human being; it only requires him to behave like a cop. It doesn't hold cops to an objective standard of behavior. Instead, the law allows an individual cop's own frailties-their fears, their racist misconceptions, and even their own hysteria-to define the scope of acceptable cop behavior. If Chauvin's lawyers were better showmen, they'd be telling the jury, \"If Chauvin could imagine being hit, you must acquit.\" As it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nThat strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye.

Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nAs it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to.

The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies.

It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nI don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell noted that during the first four minutes and 45 seconds, Floyd shouted 27 times that he could not breathe; in the 53 seconds that followed, Floyd went \"completely silent and virtually motionless\" as he experienced seizures; and for three minutes and 51 seconds, despite one of his own officers informing him that Floyd had no pulse, Chauvin remained atop his unresponsive body. For the entirety of the nine minutes and 29 seconds that the defense and prosecution agree that Chauvin kept Floyd pinned beneath his knee, Floyd was not only unarmed but handcuffed. \"He was completely in the control of the police,\" Blackwell said in his opening statement. \"He was defenseless.\" Chauvin's defense team is, essentially, charged with making the unjustifiable seem justified. By convincing jurors that the near 10 minutes Chauvin spent leaning his full weight into Floyd's neck was a \"reasonable use of force\" applied by a \"reasonable police officer,\" it hopes to create reasonable doubt about his guilt. Defense attorney Eric Nelson and a dozen cocounsel are being paid more than $1 million by Minnesota's largest police union. (Chauvin was fired by the Minneapolis Police Department after footage of Floyd's killing spread across social media, and several officers are testifying on behalf of the prosecution.) Their apparent strategy? To put witnesses, first responders, and Floyd himself, rather than Chauvin, on trial. Nelson's case leans into the fallacy of superior Black strength and what the neuroscientist Carl L. Hart labels the \"drug-crazed Negro\" myth. In his opening statement, Nelson compared Floyd's 6-foot, 3-inch frame with Chauvin's \"5-foot-9\" height, a contrast meant to paint Chauvin as helplessly dwarfed by Floyd. Because of that discrepancy in size, in tandem with Floyd's \"ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl,\" Nelson claimed, \"three Minneapolis police officers could not overcome the strength of Mr. Floyd.\" Studies show that white people believe Black people are inherently more aggressive , larger, more threatening, and less susceptible to pain than white people, stereotypes that make victimhood off-limits to Black people. Researchers have found that white Americans believe Black folks are \"more likely to have skin thick enough to withstand the pain of burning hot coals, to be strong enough to lift up a tank, or to be capable of surviving a fall from an airplane without breaking a bone\" than white people-in other words, that we are quite literally superhuman. What choice did the Minneapolis Police Department have but to dispatch four officers with guns to arrest one man accused of paying for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill? What choice, we are supposed to ask ourselves, did Chauvin have but to apply the full weight of his body against Floyd?

Stacey C. Koon informed a jury, \"which I had come to associate with PCP.\" (A drug test later showed no signs of PCP in King's bloodstream.) Darren Wilson, the officer whom a jury declined to charge in the 2014 murder of Michael Brown, described himself as feeling \"like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan\" in his court testimony. \"That's just how big he felt and how small I felt.\" Betty Shelby, the ex-Oklahoma cop acquitted in 2017 after fatally shooting Terence Crutcher as he walked away from her with his hands up, focused on the PCP found in Crutcher's system and what she labeled his \"zombie-like\" state. \"In the end, he caused his own [death],\" she claimed in a TV interview. \"This is the exact same playbook they used in my brother's trial,\" Tiffany Crutcher recently told CNN about the Chauvin defense. \"You can have police killings on video and they still get away with it.\" Nelson is using other outlandish claims against those taking the stand for the prosecution. He suggested that the crowd of witnesses to Floyd's murder, who grew so \"upset\" and \"angry\" that they were \"screaming\" at the officers to release him, caused the police officer \"to divert the attention from the care of Mr. Floyd to the threat growing in front of him.\" He again evoked the image of the threatening Black man by implying that witness Donald Williams, a mixed-martial-arts fighter who told jurors he warned Chauvin that he was using a \"blood choke\" on Floyd, had contributed to Floyd's death by growing \"angrier and angrier\" at the incident unfolding before him. \"Police know what to say and what to tell a jury and what to tell a judge to make those folks believe that they were reasonably in fear,\" Kate Levine, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, told The New York Times last year. \"Even if there are other witnesses, those witnesses just don't get the same amount of credibility determination from prosecutors, judges, juries.\" The case being made is that the fault for Floyd's death lies anywhere but with his killers: Derek Chauvin and the three cops charged with aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder. The witnesses include four teenagers who testified that they felt guilty about being unable to stop Floyd's murder and a 9-year-old who described being \"sad and kinda mad\" at seeing cops \"hurting\" Floyd. But it is Chauvin and his seemingly remorseless codefendants alone who are culpable for ending Floyd's life. The defense is taking victim-blaming to literally unbelievable levels. And yet, if only one juror buys the defense's line, Chauvin and the other officers may walk. We've seen this before. And it rarely ends with justice. \"For most of American history, killing Black people was not considered a criminal act,\" Madiba K. Dennie, a racial and gender justice attorney, told me. \"Things get difficult when we ask the criminal legal system to do something it wasn't meant to do. Justice would require a fundamental transformation of that system.\"\n\nChauvin's defense team is, essentially, charged with making the unjustifiable seem justified.

He suggested that the crowd of witnesses to Floyd's murder, who grew so \"upset\" and \"angry\" that they were \"screaming\" at the officers to release him, caused the police officer \"to divert the attention from the care of Mr. Floyd to the threat growing in front of him.\" He again evoked the image of the threatening Black man by implying that witness Donald Williams, a mixed-martial-arts fighter who told jurors he warned Chauvin that he was using a \"blood choke\" on Floyd, had contributed to Floyd's death by growing \"angrier and angrier\" at the incident unfolding before him. \"Police know what to say and what to tell a jury and what to tell a judge to make those folks believe that they were reasonably in fear,\" Kate Levine, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, told The New York Times last year. \"Even if there are other witnesses, those witnesses just don't get the same amount of credibility determination from prosecutors, judges, juries.\" The case being made is that the fault for Floyd's death lies anywhere but with his killers: Derek Chauvin and the three cops charged with aiding and abetting in Floyd's murder. The witnesses include four teenagers who testified that they felt guilty about being unable to stop Floyd's murder and a 9-year-old who described being \"sad and kinda mad\" at seeing cops \"hurting\" Floyd. But it is Chauvin and his seemingly remorseless codefendants alone who are culpable for ending Floyd's life. The defense is taking victim-blaming to literally unbelievable levels. And yet, if only one juror buys the defense's line, Chauvin and the other officers may walk. We've seen this before. And it rarely ends with justice. \"For most of American history, killing Black people was not considered a criminal act,\" Madiba K.

Floyd was alive, and then, eight minutes and 46 seconds later, he was not, and the only intervening event that happened was Chauvin's knee on his neck. Chauvin's trial started this week, and soon a jury, comprised mainly of white people (of this we can be almost certain), will tell us whether they think killing a Black man should be a crime. In a reasonable world, this trial would be perfunctory. Hell, in a reasonable world, there wouldn't even be a trial: Chauvin would have accepted some kind of plea deal. That's what most people do when they are caught on camera killing someone. But we don't live in a reasonable world-we live in a white one. Chauvin is white, and he's a cop. And his victim was Black. In most situations, that's all you need to get away with murder. Chauvin's attorneys will likely argue that something else killed Floyd during the nearly nine minutes Chauvin was suffocating him. They will claim that Floyd had some underlying health problem that made him more vulnerable to vicious police brutality than the average Black man or that something happened before the video that justified the brutality caught on camera. They will declare that Floyd's death was \"tragic,\" but fundamentally Floyd's fault. Somehow. These arguments are ludicrous and should be treated as such. Floyd is dead because he was Black, and Chauvin figured it was okay to choke a Black person to death. But Chauvin will not be judged by anyone who understands such basic facts. He will not be judged by me or anybody like me. I'm not \"impartial\" about whether Black people should be treated with the same basic human dignity as white people. According to the white people who run this system, that makes me too \"biased\" to sit on Chauvin's jury. Instead, Chauvin will be tried in front of a jury composed predominately of white people who haven't yet made up their minds on the whole violent police brutality question. You know the people I'm talking about: the \"maybe all lives should matter?\" folks. The people who use \"urban\" when they mean \"Black\" and \"thug\" when they mean \"n*****r\" but can't say it because they're in public. The system will trot out 12 of the least-informed people it can find, people who didn't even bother to fully educate themselves on why there was a massive uprising of Black people throughout the country all summer. And then that system will call their judgment \"justice.\" Current Issue View our current issue The process of stacking the jury in Chauvin's favor started this week. For those new to the art of jury selection, it's a deeply flawed process. Citizens are summoned to the courthouse, via mail, and unless they can come up with a good excuse for why they can't show up, they have to appear, usually for a couple of days. If a trial starts during that period, some of them may be randomly selected to fill out a questionnaire. The answers to that questionnaire are given under penalty of perjury, but people rarely check. Then, these prospective jurors are questioned, one by one, by the attorneys in the case (and the judge if they choose to do so). After the questioning, called the \"voir dire,\" lawyers are given the option to exercise what's called a \"peremptory challenge.\" These challenges allow lawyers to strike potential jurors on the suspicion of bias, except that lawyers don't have to explain or prove why they think a particular juror is unfit to serve. Lawyers can strike jurors for any reason, or no reason at all.

Technically, for instance, you're not allowed to strike a juror just because of their race. But as long as the striking lawyer can give a facially race-neutral reason, the exclusion of that juror will stand. So, you couldn't strike a juror for being \"Black\" but you absolutely could strike a juror for listening to rap music. The jury questionnaire for the Chauvin trial is longer than normal, and full of questions cop lawyers can use to weed out anybody Black, without having to say so. Look at some of the questions in the \"Police Contacts\" section: Have you, or someone close to you, ever helped support or advocated in favor of or against police reform? If \"Yes,\" please explain Have you ever personally seen the police use more force than was needed? If \"Yes,\" please explain Other than what you have already described above, have you, or anyone close to you, participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Black Lives Matter? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Blue Lives Matter? If you've protested against police brutality, you're almost certainly out. If you've even seen police brutality, you're also, almost certainly, out. If you think the police brutality you've heard about is bad and should be reformed, you're still probably out. But if you're an adult who buys into the false equivalency between Black Lives Matter and the racist counter-trope, Blue Lives Matter, you're probably in. Only a few people have survived peremptory challenges in the Chauvin trial thus far, and it looks like the defense is getting exactly the kind of white people it wants. Here's a local report about one of the men chosen: The man, who prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same. The whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police. This man, apparently a chemist, reportedly told the court that he works to \"find facts\" and thinks \"analytically,\" yet he said he had never seen the video of Floyd's death. So, for those playing along at home, here's a guy who thinks he likes facts but couldn't be bothered to learn the facts behind why Black people all across this country were risking Covid-19 exposure and police brutality to protest all last summer. I've endeavored to learn more \"facts\" about the family drama of a sclerotic monarchy, in a country I'm not even from, than this man bothered to learn about the desperate cries of justice from people in the nation he lives in. But he is now a juror. More from Mystal People Can Only Bear So Much Injustice Before Lashing Out Elie Mystal There's Only One Possible Conclusion: White America Likes Its Killer Cops Elie Mystal In fact, his ignorance is probably why the prosecution didn't waste one of its peremptory challenges on him. He hasn't seen the video. The prosecution is counting on being able to show the jury eight minutes and 46 seconds of Chauvin's actions, and then have that shocking footage be enough. They're hoping that while the defense tries to put Floyd on trial instead of their client, that video will even convince other white people to punish a fellow white. Maybe it will. Maybe even Chemist Clouseau over here will have a normal human reaction once he finally gets around to watching the video. But prosecutors had video of Officer Betty Shelby shooting Terence Crutcher to death on a highway in Oklahoma in 2016, while surrounded by other police and helicopter support, and she was acquitted. They had video of NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo choking Eric Garner to death in broad daylight in 2014, and he wasn't even charged. They had video of LAPD officers beating the hell out of Rodney King. And those cops were acquitted by a jury of their \"peers.\" It only takes one white person who thinks the cops should be allowed to hunt and murder Black people to hang a jury. The jury system is set up by white people, and one of its primary functions is to let white people go free when they kill Black people. Maybe that system will fail this time, allowing justice to be done.

But as long as the striking lawyer can give a facially race-neutral reason, the exclusion of that juror will stand. So, you couldn't strike a juror for being \"Black\" but you absolutely could strike a juror for listening to rap music. The jury questionnaire for the Chauvin trial is longer than normal, and full of questions cop lawyers can use to weed out anybody Black, without having to say so. Look at some of the questions in the \"Police Contacts\" section: Have you, or someone close to you, ever helped support or advocated in favor of or against police reform? If \"Yes,\" please explain Have you ever personally seen the police use more force than was needed? If \"Yes,\" please explain Other than what you have already described above, have you, or anyone close to you, participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Black Lives Matter? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Blue Lives Matter? If you've protested against police brutality, you're almost certainly out. If you've even seen police brutality, you're also, almost certainly, out. If you think the police brutality you've heard about is bad and should be reformed, you're still probably out. But if you're an adult who buys into the false equivalency between Black Lives Matter and the racist counter-trope, Blue Lives Matter, you're probably in. Only a few people have survived peremptory challenges in the Chauvin trial thus far, and it looks like the defense is getting exactly the kind of white people it wants. Here's a local report about one of the men chosen: The man, who prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same. The whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police. This man, apparently a chemist, reportedly told the court that he works to \"find facts\" and thinks \"analytically,\" yet he said he had never seen the video of Floyd's death. So, for those playing along at home, here's a guy who thinks he likes facts but couldn't be bothered to learn the facts behind why Black people all across this country were risking Covid-19 exposure and police brutality to protest all last summer. I've endeavored to learn more \"facts\" about the family drama of a sclerotic monarchy, in a country I'm not even from, than this man bothered to learn about the desperate cries of justice from people in the nation he lives in. But he is now a juror. More from Mystal People Can Only Bear So Much Injustice Before Lashing Out Elie Mystal There's Only One Possible Conclusion: White America Likes Its Killer Cops Elie Mystal In fact, his ignorance is probably why the prosecution didn't waste one of its peremptory challenges on him. He hasn't seen the video. The prosecution is counting on being able to show the jury eight minutes and 46 seconds of Chauvin's actions, and then have that shocking footage be enough. They're hoping that while the defense tries to put Floyd on trial instead of their client, that video will even convince other white people to punish a fellow white. Maybe it will. Maybe even Chemist Clouseau over here will have a normal human reaction once he finally gets around to watching the video. But prosecutors had video of Officer Betty Shelby shooting Terence Crutcher to death on a highway in Oklahoma in 2016, while surrounded by other police and helicopter support, and she was acquitted. They had video of NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo choking Eric Garner to death in broad daylight in 2014, and he wasn't even charged. They had video of LAPD officers beating the hell out of Rodney King. And those cops were acquitted by a jury of their \"peers.\" It only takes one white person who thinks the cops should be allowed to hunt and murder Black people to hang a jury. The jury system is set up by white people, and one of its primary functions is to let white people go free when they kill Black people. Maybe that system will fail this time, allowing justice to be done. But I wouldn't count on it.\n\nChauvin's attorneys will likely argue that something else killed Floyd during the nearly nine minutes Chauvin was suffocating him. They will claim that Floyd had some underlying health problem that made him more vulnerable to vicious police brutality than the average Black man or that something happened before the video that justified the brutality caught on camera. They will declare that Floyd's death was \"tragic,\" but fundamentally Floyd's fault. Somehow. These arguments are ludicrous and should be treated as such. Floyd is dead because he was Black, and Chauvin figured it was okay to choke a Black person to death. But Chauvin will not be judged by anyone who understands such basic facts. He will not be judged by me or anybody like me. I'm not \"impartial\" about whether Black people should be treated with the same basic human dignity as white people. According to the white people who run this system, that makes me too \"biased\" to sit on Chauvin's jury. Instead, Chauvin will be tried in front of a jury composed predominately of white people who haven't yet made up their minds on the whole violent police brutality question. You know the people I'm talking about: the \"maybe all lives should matter?\" folks. The people who use \"urban\" when they mean \"Black\" and \"thug\" when they mean \"n*****r\" but can't say it because they're in public. The system will trot out 12 of the least-informed people it can find, people who didn't even bother to fully educate themselves on why there was a massive uprising of Black people throughout the country all summer. And then that system will call their judgment \"justice.\" Current Issue View our current issue The process of stacking the jury in Chauvin's favor started this week. For those new to the art of jury selection, it's a deeply flawed process. Citizens are summoned to the courthouse, via mail, and unless they can come up with a good excuse for why they can't show up, they have to appear, usually for a couple of days. If a trial starts during that period, some of them may be randomly selected to fill out a questionnaire. The answers to that questionnaire are given under penalty of perjury, but people rarely check. Then, these prospective jurors are questioned, one by one, by the attorneys in the case (and the judge if they choose to do so). After the questioning, called the \"voir dire,\" lawyers are given the option to exercise what's called a \"peremptory challenge.\" These challenges allow lawyers to strike potential jurors on the suspicion of bias, except that lawyers don't have to explain or prove why they think a particular juror is unfit to serve. Lawyers can strike jurors for any reason, or no reason at all.

Look at some of the questions in the \"Police Contacts\" section: Have you, or someone close to you, ever helped support or advocated in favor of or against police reform? If \"Yes,\" please explain Have you ever personally seen the police use more force than was needed? If \"Yes,\" please explain Other than what you have already described above, have you, or anyone close to you, participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Black Lives Matter? How favorable or unfavorable are you about Blue Lives Matter? If you've protested against police brutality, you're almost certainly out. If you've even seen police brutality, you're also, almost certainly, out. If you think the police brutality you've heard about is bad and should be reformed, you're still probably out. But if you're an adult who buys into the false equivalency between Black Lives Matter and the racist counter-trope, Blue Lives Matter, you're probably in. Only a few people have survived peremptory challenges in the Chauvin trial thus far, and it looks like the defense is getting exactly the kind of white people it wants. Here's a local report about one of the men chosen: The man, who prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same. The whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police. This man, apparently a chemist, reportedly told the court that he works to \"find facts\" and thinks \"analytically,\" yet he said he had never seen the video of Floyd's death. So, for those playing along at home, here's a guy who thinks he likes facts but couldn't be bothered to learn the facts behind why Black people all across this country were risking Covid-19 exposure and police brutality to protest all last summer. I've endeavored to learn more \"facts\" about the family drama of a sclerotic monarchy, in a country I'm not even from, than this man bothered to learn about the desperate cries of justice from people in the nation he lives in. But he is now a juror. More from Mystal People Can Only Bear So Much Injustice Before Lashing Out Elie Mystal There's Only One Possible Conclusion: White America Likes Its Killer Cops Elie Mystal In fact, his ignorance is probably why the prosecution didn't waste one of its peremptory challenges on him. He hasn't seen the video. The prosecution is counting on being able to show the jury eight minutes and 46 seconds of Chauvin's actions, and then have that shocking footage be enough. They're hoping that while the defense tries to put Floyd on trial instead of their client, that video will even convince other white people to punish a fellow white. Maybe it will. Maybe even Chemist Clouseau over here will have a normal human reaction once he finally gets around to watching the video. But prosecutors had video of Officer Betty Shelby shooting Terence Crutcher to death on a highway in Oklahoma in 2016, while surrounded by other police and helicopter support, and she was acquitted. They had video of NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo choking Eric Garner to death in broad daylight in 2014, and he wasn't even charged. They had video of LAPD officers beating the hell out of Rodney King. And those cops were acquitted by a jury of their \"peers.\" It only takes one white person who thinks the cops should be allowed to hunt and murder Black people to hang a jury. The jury system is set up by white people, and one of its primary functions is to let white people go free when they kill Black people. Maybe that system will fail this time, allowing justice to be done.

      "text": "How George Floyd Was Killed in Police Custody\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nVISUAL INVESTIGATIONS\n\nThe Times has reconstructed the death of George Floyd on May 25. Security footage, witness videos and official documents show how a series of actions by officers turned fatal.\n\ntranscript\n\nIt's a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: \"No justice, no peace.\" Floyd's death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver's seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is \"awfully drunk\" and \"not in control of himself.\" Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don't know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd's hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. \"All right, what's your name?\" From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can't breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It's carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don't know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That's when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It's the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd's voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. \"Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.\" The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd's mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can't see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: \"What do you want?\" Bystander: \"I've been -\" Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can't breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: \"You having fun?\" But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: \"Bro.\" According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They've kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd's neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, \"actively resisting.\" And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: \"Get back on the sidewalk.\" According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: \"Get off of his neck!\" Bystander: \"He's still on him?\" The E.M.T.s check Floyd's pulse. Bystander: \"Are you serious?\" Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd's neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, \"no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,\" according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He's pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd's family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don't paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: \"Floyd! Floyd!\" Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd's death has only spread further and further across the United States.\n\nBy Evan Hill Ainara Tiefenthäler Christiaan Triebert Drew Jordan Haley Willis and Robin Stein\n\n[Follow live coverage of the civil rights trial against three ex-police officers in the killing of George Floyd .]\n\nOn May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd , a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911 and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers, showing no signs of life.\n\nBy combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd's death . Our video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.\n\nThe day after Mr. Floyd's death , the Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges against Derek Chauvin , the officer seen most clearly in witness videos pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin , who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds, according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\n\nOn June 3, Hennepin County prosecutors added a more serious second-degree murder charge against Mr. Chauvin and also charged each of the three other former officers - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\n\nOn June 18, the Hennepin County attorney's office said that its criminal complaint misstated the amount of time Mr. Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck. The complaint originally said that Mr. Chauvin had done so for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a length of time that became a symbol and rallying cry for protesters . Responding to inquiries from journalists who noted a discrepancy with the durations listed in the complaint, the office said the actual time was seven minutes and 46 seconds. But The Times's own analysis of the video shows that this revised time is also incorrect .\n\n\"It makes no difference,\" said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families of crime victims in Minneapolis. \"The bottom line is, it was long enough to kill him, long enough to execute him.\"\n\nNicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.\n\nEvan Hill is a reporter on the Visual Investigations team.

      "text": "How George Floyd Was Killed in Police Custody\n\nnew video loaded: How George Floyd Was Killed in Police Custody\n\ntranscript\n\nIt's a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: \"No justice, no peace.\" Floyd's death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver's seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is \"awfully drunk\" and \"not in control of himself.\" Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don't know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd's hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. \"All right, what's your name?\" From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can't breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It's carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don't know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That's when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It's the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd's voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. \"Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.\" The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd's mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can't see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: \"What do you want?\" Bystander: \"I've been -\" Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can't breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: \"You having fun?\" But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: \"Bro.\" According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They've kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd's neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, \"actively resisting.\" And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: \"Get back on the sidewalk.\" According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: \"Get off of his neck!\" Bystander: \"He's still on him?\" The E.M.T.s check Floyd's pulse. Bystander: \"Are you serious?\" Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd's neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, \"no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,\" according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He's pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd's family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don't paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: \"Floyd! Floyd!\" Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd's death has only spread further and further across the United States.\n\n0:54\n\n0:40\n\n14:23\n\n1:14\n\n1:22\n\n1:16\n\n4:39\n\n1:10\n\n2:11\n\n1:13\n\n1:34\n\n1:12\n\nAdvertisement"

His death in police custody is powering a movement against police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nBy Manny Fernandez and Audra D. S. Burch\n\nHOUSTON - It was the last day of 11th grade at Jack Yates High School in Houston, nearly three decades ago.

To their 17-year-old minds, touching the world maybe meant the N.B.A. or the N.F.L.\n\n\"It was one of the first moments I remembered after learning what happened to him,\" Mr. Veal said. \"He could not have imagined that this is the tragic way people would know his name.\"\n\nThe world now knows George Perry Floyd Jr. through his final harrowing moments , as he begged for air, his face wedged for nearly nine minutes between a city street and a police officer's knee.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Death of George Floyd, in Context\n\nTwo incidents separated by twelve hours and twelve hundred miles have taken on the appearance of the control and the variable in a grotesque experiment about race in America. On Monday morning, in New York City's Central Park, a white woman named Amy Cooper called 911 and told the dispatcher that an African-American man was threatening her. The man she was talking about, Christian Cooper, who is no relation, filmed the call on his phone. They were in the Ramble, a part of the park favored by bird-watchers, including Christian Cooper, and he had simply requested that she leash her dog-something that is required in the area. In the video, before making the call, Ms. Cooper warns Mr. Cooper that she is \"going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.\" Her needless inclusion of the race of the man she fears serves only to summon the ancient impulse to protect white womanhood from the threats posed by black men. For anyone with a long enough memory or a recent enough viewing of the series \" When They See Us ,\" the locale of this altercation becomes part of the story: we know what happened to five young black and brown men who were falsely accused of attacking a white woman in Central Park.\n\nOn Monday evening, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a forty-six-year-old black man named George Floyd died in a way that highlighted the implications that calls such as the one Amy Cooper placed can have; George Floyd is who Christian Cooper might have been. (The police made no arrests and filed no summons in Central Park. Amy Cooper has apologized for her actions; she was also fired from her job.) Police responding to a call from a shopkeeper, about someone trying to pass a potentially counterfeit bill, arrested Floyd. Surveillance video shows a compliant man being led away in handcuffs. But cellphone video later shows a white police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for seven minutes, despite protests from onlookers that his life is in jeopardy. In an echo of the police killing of Eric Garner , in 2014, Floyd repeatedly says, \"I can't breathe,\" and then, \"I'm about to die.\" When the officer eventually removes his knee, Floyd's body is limp and unresponsive. A person nearby can be heard saying, \"They just killed him.\" Floyd was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A police statement said that Floyd appeared to be in \"medical distress,\" but made no mention of his being pinned to the ground with the weight of a police officer compressing his airway.\n\nThe video of Floyd's death is horrific but not surprising; terrible but not unusual, depicting a kind of incident that is periodically reënacted in the United States. It's both necessary and, at this point, pedestrian to observe that policing in this country is mediated by race. On Tuesday, in Minneapolis, hundreds of protesters, many wearing face masks to guard against COVID -19, braved the pandemic to protest at the spot where Floyd died. Outside a nearby precinct house, police cars were pelted with rocks, and officers responded by firing tear gas. But, within twenty-four hours of the video coming to light, the Minneapolis Police Department fired the officer who had knelt on Floyd and three others who had been at the scene. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that the firings were \"the right call,\" but here, too, context matters.\n\nIn November, 2015, police responding to calls of a dispute between a man and a woman in north Minneapolis fatally shot a twenty-four-year-old African-American man named Jamar Clark. Police and paramedics on the scene claimed that Clark had resisted arrest and had attempted to grab an officer's gun; bystanders claimed that he was handcuffed and on the ground when the shot was fired. Clark's death was followed by more than two weeks of demonstrations outside the Fourth Police Precinct in Minneapolis, led by Black Lives Matter; an attempt to disrupt holiday shopping at the Mall of America, in protest; and cascading contempt from black residents that, two years later, factored into Mayor Betsy Hodges losing her reëlection bid. In light of that history, Frey has been unequivocal about police culpability in Floyd's death. \"Being black in America should not be a death sentence,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nThe larger question, however, is whether the officers involved will face any legal consequences. The Twin Cities area has been an outsized part of the dialogue about the police use of force. The year after Clark's death, Philando Castile was fatally shot in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, by a police officer who was alarmed because Castile had a gun in his car, even though he had identified himself as a licensed gun owner. (Castile's girlfriend recorded the aftermath of the shooting on her phone.) In 2017, Justine Damond was fatally shot by a police officer who was responding to her own call about a possible assault taking place behind her Minneapolis home. No charges were brought against officers in Clark's death. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Castile, was fired from the department, but was acquitted of second-degree-manslaughter charges. Mohamed Noor, the officer who shot Damond, was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and was sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison. The Damond case was atypical, both in that it involved the fatal shooting of a white woman by a black officer of Somali descent, and that Damond was an Australian citizen, which generated international pressure for a conviction in the case. No charges were brought against Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, on Staten Island, whose arrest was also recorded on video by a bystander, and has been widely referenced since Floyd's death. (He was fired from the department in 2019.) By odd coincidence,\" American Trial ,\" a film that features a mock trial of Pantaleo for murder, was just released.\n\nThe investigation into Floyd's death also exists in the context of an ongoing investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery , a twenty-five-year-old African-American who was shot in southeast Georgia when two men attempted to enact a citizen's arrest while a third recorded a video of the incident. There is yet another investigation of fatal police force in Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor, a twenty-six-year-old African-American E.M.T., was shot to death in her apartment by officers who were conducting a drug raid at what her family said was the wrong address.\n\nThere is more to be said about the burgeoning genre of videos capturing the deaths of black Americans, and the complex combination of revulsion and compulsion that accompanies their viewing. They are the macabre documentary of current events, but the question remains about whether they do more to humanize or to objectify the unwilling figures at the center of their narratives. Death is too intimate a phenomenon to not be distorted by a mass audience. Yesterday, very few of us knew who George Floyd was, what he cared about, how he lived his life. Today, we know him no better save for the grim way in which that life met its end.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Shooting of Daunte Wright and the Meaning of George Floyd's Death\n\nGeorge Floyd Square, the intersection in Minneapolis where Floyd died , last May, features a mural that says \"You Changed the World, George.\" And, in the eleven months since Floyd's agonizing death, captured on video, we have seen changes ranging from mercenary corporate endorsements of the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" to personal reckonings with the role of race in American society as well as substantial legislative and policy changes regarding policing. But for Floyd's death, New York City would likely not have unsealed the disciplinary records of more than eighty thousand police officers earlier this year. The biggest question surrounding this raft of changes has been whether it will translate into a decreased likelihood of Black people dying during routine interactions with law enforcement. In Minneapolis, a city already on edge because the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of killing Floyd, is now in its third week there, the answer to that question, at least from the vantage point of the hundreds of people who have gathered outside the Brooklyn Center police station for the past two nights, is no.\n\nOn Sunday, a twenty-year-old named Daunte Wright was stopped near the intersection of Sixty-third and Lee Avenues in Brooklyn Center, an inner-ring suburb of Minneapolis. The reasons for the stop are in dispute: Wright's mother, Katie, told a rally on Sunday evening that Daunte had called her when he was pulled over and said that it was because he had an air-freshener hanging from his rearview mirror (which is prohibited in Minnesota). On Monday, the police department suggested that there had been an issue with his registration tags. (On Tuesday, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer now representing the Wright family, noted a pandemic-related backlog in processing paperwork for license plates.) A young woman sat in the front passenger seat. During the stop, the police reportedly found that there was a warrant against Wright for two misdemeanors-involving a weapons-possession charge-which were issued after he had missed a court date. What is not in dispute is that Kim Potter, a twenty-six-year veteran of the police force, shouted \"Taser!\" as Wright struggled with an officer who was trying to remove him from his car, but she was actually holding a gun instead of a Taser, and fired a single bullet. (The police department later said that she had drawn the gun in error.) Wright drove off before losing consciousness and crashing several blocks away. He died at the scene. The young woman in the car was treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital. Officer Potter resigned on Tuesday, as did Tim Gannon, the city's chief of police.\n\nOn Sunday, at the rally, Joanie Shafer, a local photographer, highlighting the connections between Floyd and Wright, pointed out that Wright had called his mother on the phone when the officers pulled him over, and that Floyd had called out to his deceased mother as he himself was dying. The implication was that interactions with the police had become so fraught that grown men were enlisting the aid of their mothers, on earth or in the hereafter.\n\nAmong the various perspectives in the Twin Cities regarding the Chauvin trial, the police, and the significance of all that happened last spring and summer after Floyd's death, there seems to be only one conclusion shared by residents across race, class, and social boundaries: that a failure to convict Derek Chauvin will lead to another eruption of violence in the area. On Sunday night, those predictions were turned on their heads, when it became clear that more violence was not contingent on a Chauvin acquittal.\n\nAbout four hundred people, most but far from all of them Black, gathered to protest Wright's death in front of the Humboldt Avenue police station, in Brooklyn Center. About sixty officers stood in formation outside the building, in riot gear. Around 11 P.M. , some people in the crowd began throwing bricks, rocks, and garbage in the direction of the officers, who responded with tear gas. The winds shifted, though, and the gas blew away from the demonstration and back toward the police station. The crowd, which had begun to scatter, realized this, and surged forward. More rocks were thrown, followed by flash grenades and more tear gas, in a cycle that repeated until the police began firing rubber bullets into the crowd.\n\n\"They couldn't even wait until the trial was over to kill somebody else,\" one man told me. Wright's death was not the only indictment of facile ideas of change. A video of Caron Nazario, a Black and Latino second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, showing him being pulled over by two police officers in Windsor, Virginia, last December, had surfaced a few days earlier. (There were no license plates on the new S.U.V. that Nazario was driving, but temporary ones were reportedly taped inside the rear window.) Nazario, who had placed his hands outside the window, to indicate that he had no weapon, told the officers, who had drawn their guns, that he was \" honestly afraid to get out of the car .\" In response, Nazario, who was in uniform, was pepper-sprayed and removed from his vehicle. (One of the officers involved, Joe Gutierrez, was fired on Sunday.) For all the anxiety about the Chauvin trial, it had almost become ambient noise in a tide of events that seemed to be a more accurate barometer of where things stand on matters of race and policing.\n\nOn Monday, the Twin Cities area imposed a curfew, from 7 P.M. to 6 A.M. A candlelight vigil for Wright, which had been scheduled for 7 P.M. , was pushed up an hour, so as to not be in conflict with the order. Hundreds gathered at Sixty-third and Lee, many of them carrying electric votive candles, because a cold rain had drizzled all evening. A shrine of flowers was created down the street, where Wright died. The Twin Cities Relief Initiative, which provides food and services to people in need-and which began as the group Twin Cities Stand Together , established after Floyd's death, to feed protesters and local families-set up a table and offered free hot dogs and bottled water. That gathering dispersed not long after the curfew took effect, but a young, more intransigent, portion of it reconvened at the Humboldt Avenue station house, where, about an hour later, clashes with the police erupted again. As this was happening, Crump, who now represents both the Wrights and the Floyds, was maneuvering to put the grieving families in contact. An emotional press conference with members of the two families-and of others, including Emmett Till's-was held outside the Hennepin County Government Center, on Tuesday afternoon. Katie Wright, wrapped in a blanket but shivering in thirty-four-degree weather and snow flurries, stared at the ground. At one point, Philonise Floyd, George's brother, leaned over and wrapped his arm around her, but the connections between their stories had already been secured in the public's mind: they represented two installments in a serial American tragedy that no one wishes to see but is set to be replayed for the foreseeable future.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Prophecies of George Floyd\n\nGeorge Floyd 's death may be the most consequential police killing to have occurred since smartphones gave us the ability to document the realities of police violence. The details, captured on recordings by passersby, are by now familiar. On May 25, 2020, Floyd, a forty-six-year-old former bouncer, was accused of passing off a fake twenty-dollar bill at a convenience store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Two police officers, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, arrived at the scene, and Lane quickly drew his weapon. Floyd was a large man: six feet six, two hundred and twenty-three pounds. Perhaps hoping to seem less threatening, he told the cops that he had been shot before and asked them not to shoot him. The officers cuffed him and tried to put him in their cruiser. He said that he was claustrophobic and resisted getting in the cramped car. To restrain him, the cops held him to the ground. Kueng placed his knees on Floyd's torso, and Lane placed his knees on Floyd's legs. Derek Chauvin, another officer who had arrived on the scene, dug his knee into Floyd's neck.\n\nAt this point, Floyd began foretelling his own death. \"Y'all, I'm going to die in here,\" he said. \"I'm going to die, man.\" He cried out that he couldn't breathe. \"Please, the knee in my neck . . . I'll probably die this way.\" As Floyd continued to plead for his life, Chauvin announced that he was under arrest. \"All right, all right. Oh, my God,\" Floyd said. Then, eerily, as if the deed had already been done, he said, \"Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\" He soon fell unconscious and was hustled into an ambulance and sent to the hospital. He died of cardiac arrest an hour later.\n\nIn 2008, while working on a book about Martin Luther King, Jr., I was struck by what I came to call King's \"automortology\"-the manner in which he seemed to prophesy his own death, at times even narrating it as if it had already happened. This rhetorical form dates back at least to the life of Jesus, who resisted Roman oppression, and knew that the state was mustering its forces against him. In Mark, the earliest Gospel, he begins predicting that his death is imminent, telling his followers that he will be \"killed and after three days rise again.\" He describes the particulars of his death, saying that he will be \"mocked and flogged and crucified.\" This prophetic mode gives him the rhetorical leverage to shape how his death should be understood: it will not, he insists, be a victory for the Romans and the end to his movement. Instead, it will form part of God's larger plan, which will lead to the salvation of humankind and the spread of Christianity around the world.\n\nLike Jesus, King did his work under the spectre of violence. Several of his colleagues were murdered for their agitation on behalf of Black emancipation: Medgar Evers was assassinated in 1963, and Malcolm X in 1965. When King was in his late twenties, his home in Montgomery, Alabama, was bombed by a white supremacist. In 1958, at a book signing in Harlem, a woman stabbed him with a letter opener. He soon began to speak as if his death were inevitable. In 1965, on a brief trek to the grave site of the martyred church deacon Jimmie Lee Jackson, with a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King said, \"This may be my last walk.\" When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, in Dallas, King insisted to his wife, Coretta, \"This is what is going to happen to me also.\" Coretta later said, \"I had no word to comfort my husband. I could not say, 'It won't happen to you.' I felt he was right.\" When a plane that King was on was targeted with a bomb threat, in 1964, King said to Coretta and his aide Dorothy Cotton, \"I've told you all that I don't expect to survive this revolution.\" Early on, King made clear that his death would not be a defeat for the project of civil rights. \"If I am stopped, our work will not stop,\" King said in 1956. He told the journalist Alex Haley, in 1965, that his martyrdom would propel the movement, saying, \"If I should lose my life, in some way it would aid the cause.\"\n\nIn 1968, he travelled to Memphis to speak on behalf of striking sanitation workers. \"Like anybody, I'd like to live a long life,\" he said. \"But I'm not concerned about that now. . . . I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land.\" The next evening, he was assassinated on his balcony at the Lorraine Motel. By this point, he had become a pariah within the country's political landscape: unpopular with white moderates because he criticized the Vietnam War, and upstaged within Black activist circles by younger Black Power advocates. But, in death, he became a martyr, the primary symbol of the fight for racial justice in America. As Jon Meacham and Vern E. Smith wrote, in Newsweek , while King \"lay dying, the popular beatification was already underway.\"\n\nIn hip-hop's golden era, the rapper Tupac Shakur became similarly obsessed with his own death. Tupac was born in 1971 to parents who were Black Panthers. Violence followed him. In 1991, two Oakland policemen slammed him to the ground in a chokehold and arrested him for jaywalking. In 1994, Tupac was shot five times during a robbery at Manhattan's Quad Studios. He came to believe that he wouldn't be around long. The director Vondie Curtis Hall, who directed Tupac in the film \"Gridlock'd,\" said that the rapper \"knew he was never going to hit thirty,\" and that this belief \"allows you to live with a certain level of abandonment\" and to \"accept destiny without fear.\" Maxine Waters, a Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles, who knew Tupac when he lived in her city, told me in 2001, for a book I was working on at the time, that Tupac was \"wild and unpredictable, and even troubled,\" but that he \"stared danger in the eye and didn't flinch one bit.\"\n\nIf King channeled the moral energy of Black resistance in the argot of the Black bourgeoisie, Tupac spoke for the masses of Black folk hustling in the underground economy and contending with the everyday realities of police violence. In \"Point the Finga,\" Tupac describes himself getting lynched by cops, who face no consequences and stay on the state's payroll. On \"Hellrazor,\" Tupac speaks of police officers who seek him for investigation, because, he says, \"I'm marked for death.\" On \"Only Fear of Death,\" Tupac confesses that \"I see visions of me dead.\" On \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" he says that \"I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt,\" and that all his people will \"be mournin'.\" He framed his death as one on behalf of poor, inner-city Black people around the country. \"Let me die in the line of duty, the duty of the 'hood,\" he told the reporter Veronica Chambers, in 1992. On his song \"Black Jesuz,\" one of Tupac's comrades prays for \"a Saint that we pray to in the ghetto.\" In 1996, Tupac was murdered in a drive-by shooting, in Las Vegas. \"He was a martyr before it even happened,\" Robin Kelley, a historian at U.C.L.A., told me, for the same book. \"So much of his music was about the inevitability of his demise, and at the same time he also had this almost Jesus-like voice, where he would preach and, in his own body and experience, would articulate all this pain and hope.\"\n\nMost Black folks are neither Nobel laureates nor internationally acclaimed hip-hop artists, but they still live under the threat of violence. Black people in America have a shorter lifespan than white people; in areas like Baltimore, the life-expectancy gap is twenty years. This is largely the result of the forces of systemic racism, which affects the economic circumstances, medical and behavioral forces, and geographic and environmental conditions that determine one's health. Black Americans are also six times more likely to be murdered than white Americans, and they are up to six times more likely than whites to be killed during a police encounter. In a further injustice, when Black people are killed by the police, they are often posthumously smeared, in an attempt to justify the killing. After Mike Brown was killed by a cop on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, a security video was released that appeared to show Brown stealing cigarillos from a convenience store moments before he was killed; a subsequent video of an earlier encounter suggests that, in fact, he may instead have been giving a small bag of marijuana to store employees and receiving the cigarillos in return. After Breonna Taylor was killed by police officers, in Louisville, Kentucky, she was falsely rumored to have been living with a drug dealer.\n\nAutomortology is Black obituary on the sly. It allows a person, living under a threat of violence, to acknowledge this sense of impending doom. And it allows the person, who has little control over the circumstances of the death, to exercise some control over the narrative that will attend her death. Floyd was an imposing Black man with a history of arrests for drug use, and his death might ordinarily have been cast as the necessary killing of a threatening suspect. But, because there was video footage of Floyd being docile and solicitous, asking the officers not to kill him, and repeatedly saying \"I can't breathe,\" it was clear that his death was unnecessary and unjust. And the fact that he could tell that his death was coming, almost from the moment the officers arrived on the scene, and that he repeatedly predicted its occurrence, underscored the inevitability of violence in encounters between police officers and Black suspects. It preëmptively framed Floyd's death as a police killing of an innocent Black man-one in a sordid series. Floyd became a global icon for social justice. Today, there are murals of Floyd's face on walls across the globe, and quilts bearing his image. More than sixty Confederate statues have been taken down in his name. His killing sparked the largest protests for racial justice in the history of the country. The same nation that couldn't keep him alive has been inspired by his death to confront our racial demons.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

If I had written these words a little more than a year ago, G.F. alive. In a year, he will not be alive, whether I write or don't write this story about him. Except perhaps alive in the way stories live , or alive as people say people are alive in stories. People saying that as if they do not understand: dead once, dead forever. As if they don't know that once is all the time a person ever gets to be alive. As if they don't know that G.F. doesn't hear, doesn't desire mourning, clamor, and cries. As if they do not comprehend that their millions of bodies piled up or kneeling in prayer or prostrate in the street next to G.F. all weigh less than this sheet of paper on which I scribble, and that the commotion, agitation, exercise of their millions upon millions of hearts and minds will not summon a single breath of air when G.F. needs it.\n\nI will not pretend to bring G.F. to life. Nor pretend to bring life to him. G.F. gone for good. Won't return. No place for G.F. except the past. And the past is not even past, a wise man once declared. Same abyss behind and in front of us is what the wisecracker writer signifying, I believe, and, if I truly believe what he believed, where would I situate G.F. if presented with an opportunity to put him somewhere alive? Not here. Not here in this story where I know better.\n\nBetter to forget G.F. Better to let go, or simply leave G.F. alone, thank you, than attempt to invent the point of view of a person not here, not where I am, a person who somehow possesses the power to see G.F. breathing, moving around, to hear G.F.'s thoughts. A person also able to observe me here, myself performing this grief, this terror and anger, this attempt to console myself and define and control and locate myself, establish myself as one who is offering a story about G.F., a true story confirming my suffering, my connection to him, a story about who he is, who I am, a story about myself, as if I am not here where I am and he is not where he is. As if the two of us not permanently separate as life from death. As dreams from objects dreamed.\n\nBetter to acknowledge impenetrable darkness surrounding G.F. and me, black darkness blinding me when I pretend I can speak with the authority of a being I imagine whose perspective absolutely reliable. Why write as if I can access the power such an angelic being might possess. As if I am able to employ that power to see, to enter G.F. Power to convince myself, or anybody who might be paying attention or reading or simply curious, that my feelings for G.F., my performance, my outrage, my rituals of claiming and disclaiming an unbreakable relationship to him are authentic. Serve some useful purpose. That my eyes, words reliable, convincing as words, eyes of that imaginary observer I proposed a few sentences ago. Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory. A kind of presumption. Wishful thinking at best. Guilt and avoidance at worst. Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven. Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I'm pretending I am.\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee ( I know him-know the motherfucker's name ) pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me. How long. How long. Hands cuffed behind back. Cop body sits on my body pressing it down in a city street. Many shoes, boots shuffling too close to eyes. Wonder if they will stomp my eyes. Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell. Not leave-taking, not goody, good, goodbye. But return to scene of crime. Recount each blow like a senator on the Senate floor who produces cinema verité for his colleagues-pounding rostrum POW-POW-POW-POW-POW-fifty-six times in eighty-one seconds-like cop fists, cop feet striking Rodney King's body fifty-six hard, loud times-for eighty-one seconds-ignite cities. Like the four hundred blows- les quatre cents coups , as the French saying goes- dirty tricks delivered blow after blow in a black-and-white movie for viewers to silently regard-four hundred uncountable blows beating a boy to his knees. Different strokes for different folks in different countries. Same pain always. Whose. Whose blows. In whose language did the recorder hear Truffaut saying: I demand that a film either express the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between.\n\nAs I read, I learn more about goodbyes, farewells to the dead, about narrative art, about protests, protesters, protestations, learn that the singer Esther Phillips, née Jones, born colored on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas-two days later and you could call her an Xmas present-learn she recorded \"No Headstone on My Grave,\" a Charlie Rich song, in 1962, eleven years before G.F. was born, with all his live years ahead of him before he's on his stomach on hard concrete or asphalt of a Minneapolis street begging for more breath, more life than he's going to get. Wondering how he hears, of all things, a blues/church-voiced woman singing words he can't quite make out, words gone quick as they come, quick as they go, but slow, too, and sad words, no doubt, very gotdamn sad brushing past, he whiffs thick sad on them, sad in a voice sad as blues and church, sad, slow, quick as a very last breath nobody ever hears anyway neck squeezed in a vise or not. . . . Oh, don't, don't, don't / Don't put no headstone on my grave / All my life I've been a slave. . . . Just put me down and let me be / Free from all this misery. . . . Tell my mother not to cry. . . . Tell her that I'm finally free. . . . Don't put no headstone. . . . Words passing, dangling, no place to go like the man seen dangling from a rope ain't going no place else but there where he sways in that old South story old people tell and some soul long ago snapped photos, scared the shit out him, but ain't him, ain't me, is it exactly that she sings to, sings for. Timing all wrong, and, anyway, another country, bro, and besides the wench dead (August 7, 1984). And we outlive King, too, don't we-drowned (June 17, 2012) in his own swimming pool.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Fury at America and Its Values Spreads Globally\n\nAmerica is on the defensive worldwide over the murder of George Floyd and all that the killing implies about race, values, and leadership-not to mention common decency-in the United States. On Sunday, thousands defied a government lockdown in Britain to march through the streets of London-from the famed Trafalgar Square, past the Houses of Parliament, along and across the River Thames, to the U.S. Embassy-to protest the murder of an unarmed black man by white police in Minneapolis, four thousand miles away. The coronavirus pandemic -and its risks-be damned. \"The death of George Floyd has rightly ignited fury and anguish not just in the USA but around the world,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted . \"No country, city, police force or institution can be complacent about racism and the impact this has.\" He also warned about the dangers of infection from COVID -19 at crowded protests. \"Lockdown has not been lifted,\" he tweeted. \"The virus is still out there.\" The protest nonetheless went on for hours, including a sit-in in front of the Embassy. Homemade cardboard signs read \"White silence is violence\" and \"Do I matter only after death? #GeorgeFloyd.\" Hundreds more turned out in northern Manchester, and more still in the Welsh capital of Cardiff, around its historic castle, to protest racism in America. Three more protests-in a country that is America's closest ally- are planned over the next week.\n\nAt Berlin's Mauerpark-situated where a section of the Wall separated East and West Germany, from 1961 to 1989-a mural of Floyd has been painted on a remnant of the Berlin Wall, alongside the words \"I can't breathe.\" Protesters showed up in Berlin both Saturday and Sunday to denounce death from discrimination in the United States. They marched to the U.S. Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate, another historic symbol of the Cold War era. Their focus was on a different kind of war. \"Stop killing us,\" one sign pleaded. In normally tranquil Copenhagen, two thousand showed up, on Saturday, at an angry demonstration at the U.S. Embassy. Thousands turned out in Toronto, too, over the weekend, to protest the deaths of Floyd and a black Canadian woman, who fell to her death from a twenty-fourth-floor apartment on Wednesday, while police were on the scene. And those countries are all our allies.\n\nThe fury at America-so deep that protesters risked infection by the deadly coronavirus pathogen-is partly a reaction to three years of pent-up frustration with the Trump Administration. Many in Britain and other allied nations \"are saddened by the damage which President Trump and his Republican supporters are doing to the values we share, to freedom of expression, to the rule of law,\" Sir Peter Westmacott, the former British Ambassador to the United States, told me. \"And even-if he means what he says-to democracy itself.\"\n\nBut the disillusionment goes deeper now. The demonstrations in London and elsewhere \"seem to be less about Donald Trump than about the continuing failure of society everywhere to end the scourge of racism,\" Westmacott said. \"Young people, black and white, are horrified by the video they have seen of a white policeman knowingly and illegally putting to death a black man detained for a possible minor offense-and suspect that, as usual, the policeman will get away with it. It happened in Minneapolis. But it might have happened somewhere else.\"\n\nOn Monday, the European Union issued a statement calling for the swift resolution of \"all the issues\" that have emerged during a week of unrest in a hundred and forty American cities, with \"full respect for the rule of law and human rights.\" It used the kind of language usually directed at dictatorial governments. \"We regret the loss of life, express our condolences to those affected and condemn violence and racism regardless of where it comes from,\" the E.U. added.\n\nThe outrage about the lack of decency and the American double standard has now gone global in everyday life, including sport. In Germany, where a soccer league recently became the first in Europe to resume play (albeit without fans), four players individually expressed their anger in matches over the weekend. After scoring his first career hat trick, Jadon Sancho, of Borussia Dortmund, pulled off his yellow shirt to reveal another shirt underneath, with a handwritten message in black letters: \"Justice for George Floyd.\" He was willing to take a yellow card for misconduct, for playing politics on the field. He later tweeted, about scoring, \"A bittersweet moment personally as there are more important things going on in the world today that we must address and help make a change.\" His teammate Achraf Hakimi followed suit after he scored, later in the game. In another match, a player took a knee after scoring, the same symbolic move made famous by the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. What is striking about the protest signs and the body language, whatever country they're in, is that they are almost all in English or use symbols from the American experience. The message in so many lands-that America has failed its people-is meant for American ears.\n\nThe protests reflect a broader global despair about the failure of the American experiment-and what that means for the rest of the world. \"People all over the world understand that their own fights for human rights, for equality and fairness, will become so much more difficult to win if we are going to lose America as the place where 'I have a dream' is a real and universal political program,\" Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German Ambassador to Washington and the current chairman of the Munich Security Conference, told me. \"Let's hope the demonstrations all over the world will help remind Washington that U.S. soft power is a unique asset, setting America apart from other great powers-from China, Russia, and even from Europe. It would be tragic if the Trump Administration turned a huge opportunity for the U.S. into a moral abdication.\"\n\nIn Africa, U.S. diplomats have scrambled to counter the damage to America's image over the past week. A prominent media entrepreneur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo directed a scathing tweet to Mike Hammer, the U.S. Ambassador: \"Dear ambassador, your country is shameful. Proud America, which went through everything from segregation to the election of Barack Obama, still hasn't conquered the demons of racism. How many black people must be killed by white police officers before authorities react seriously?\" Hammer responded on Twitter, in French, \"I am profoundly troubled by the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Justice Department is conducting a full criminal investigation as a top priority. Security forces around the world should be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"\n\nAmerica's rivals are exploiting the growing U.S. unrest for their own goals-and to justify their own policies. In China, the editor of the Global Times cynically tweeted , \"I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?\" Over the past week, Trump and Pompeo have issued sharp public condemnations of China for its new security law allowing crackdowns on months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. In Russia, Vladimir Putin's Foreign Ministry lambasted \"systemic problems in human rights\" in the United States. \"This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,\" the ministry said, in a statement. \"American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.\"\n\nIn Iran, which has faced two years of escalating pressure from the Trump Administration, the English-language account of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted , \"If you're dark-skinned walking in the US, you can't be sure you'll be alive in the next few minutes.\" The tweet added the hashtags \"#ICantBreathe\" and \"#BlackLivesMatter.\" It was accompanied by a short video chronicling slavery in the United States. In the holy city of Mashhad, a group of young people held a candlelight vigil for Floyd, complete with posters of him above the hashtag \"#JusticeforFloyd\" and a sign, in English, declaring, \"Black Lives Matter.\" The impact of Floyd's murder even consumed people facing far greater existential challenges. In Syria, where more than half a million people have died at the hands of a ruthless dictator during the country's nine-year civil war, local artists painted a mural of Floyd on the side of a destroyed building in Idlib Province. Above it, in big pink letters, they wrote, \"No to racism.\"\n\nThe United States has been struggling to counter China's deepening economic and diplomatic presence around the world by claiming that it offers a better model. It's an increasingly hard sell after the police killings of so many black Americans and a higher COVID -19 death rate among African-Americans. \"People are genuinely appalled that a police officer could treat an African-American man with such gratuitous and ultimately lethal violence,\" Ken Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, told me. The global protests are also \"a commentary on the perceived callousness of American society that has come to the fore during this pandemic, with African-Americans and other minorities disproportionately affected due to a constellation of factors that include the 'co-morbidities' of poverty,\" he said. \"That a wealthy nation could treat its minorities so shabbily fuels the outrage over George Floyd's death.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Sorrow and Relief in Minneapolis\n\nOn Monday morning, shortly after the final arguments in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd began, members of Floyd's family walked through the deserted streets of downtown Minneapolis toward the fortified entrance of the Hennepin County Government Center. Philonise Floyd, George's brother, was accompanied by his wife, Keeta Floyd; the Reverend Al Sharpton; Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; and a small swarm of photographers and cameramen. As they approached the fortified barricades of the courthouse, they held up their fists in the symbol of Black power, otherwise ignoring requests for comment. Three thousand members of the Minnesota National Guard have been activated this week, roughly the number of U.S. troops that are currently deployed in Afghanistan. As the family members made their way through a small gap in the wire-topped fence, a red van pulled up. Its passengers, perhaps recognizing Philonise Floyd or Sharpton from television, or simply seeing the upraised fists, slowed down to honk their horn and shout out \"Black Lives Matter.\" From another car, parked down the street and covered in spray-painted movement slogans, the broadcast of the trial could be heard through open windows.\n\n\"His name was George Perry Floyd, Jr., and he was born on October 14, 1973, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to his parents, George Floyd, Sr., and Larcenia Jones Floyd,\" Steve Schleicher, an attorney with the state, said, beginning his closing argument. In the next two hours, Schleicher repeated a version of the phrase \"nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds\" more than twenty times, referring to how long Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck. Schleicher urged the jury to set aside any difficulty they might have in conceiving that a police officer can also be a criminal, and reminded them that several bystanders, watching Chauvin kill Floyd, had called the police to try and stop it. \"It's exactly what you saw with your eyes,\" Schleicher said, in conclusion. \"It's exactly what you knew. It's what you felt in your gut. It's what you now know in your heart. This wasn't policing. This was murder.\"\n\nOutside, the city listened and waited. In the early afternoon, at the U.S. Bank Stadium, where the Vikings play, high-school students gathered on a swath of lawn, as part of a school walkout, and listened to speeches by their peers. At 1:47 P.M. , the time of day that Daunte Wright was shot and killed by the police officer Kim Potter in Brooklyn Center, a suburb north of Minneapolis, eight days before, they sat on the ground for three minutes of silence, representing the time that it took for a fatally injured Wright to drive several blocks before dying. The killing of Wright, a twenty-year-old father of one, seemed to indicate that little had changed in the past year; an overzealous response by law enforcement to the relatively small local protests that followed Wright's death suggested that the police would handle demonstrations no less brutally than they had last summer. In response to protesters who threw bottles and rocks, law enforcement fired pepper spray, tear gas, and rubber bullets, and arrested more than a hundred people. Nearby residents complained about the tear gas seeping into their apartments. A consortium of twenty news organizations wrote a letter of complaint to the governor, Tim Walz, about police attacks on journalists, including the instances of two Agence France-Presse reporters who were pepper-sprayed at close range, a Black photographer on assignment for the Times whom the police attacked with batons, and an Asian-American CNN producer, who, after being ordered to the ground and zip-tied, was asked whether she spoke English. At a press conference on Monday, Walz called the police attacks on journalists \"unacceptable.\" Asked by a reporter who was inciting more aggression, the protesters or the police, Walz said, \"I think it's a bit of a chicken and an egg.\"\n\nInside the courthouse, the defense, for its closing argument, offered confusion and ambiguity. \"I understand that superhuman strength is not a real phenomenon,\" Eric Nelson, Chauvin's attorney, said at one point. \"But officers are specifically trained that someone under the influence of certain types of controlled substances exhibit this behavior. They become stronger than they normally would. We've all heard the anecdotal stories of the pregnant mom lifting the car off of someone.\" He emphasized Floyd's drug use. He spoke for a long time-so long that, at the two-and-a-half hour mark, as the clock approached two in the afternoon, the judge interrupted him so that the jury could eat lunch. A rebuttal from the state followed, and then the members of the jury began their deliberations, before adjourning at 8 P.M. A few hundred people led a march through the streets of downtown. Jesse Jackson spoke. The police kept their distance.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but wait. Residents posted photographs on social media of military vehicles parked next to neighborhood eateries, or detailed their gnawing anxiety. Shortly before 2:30 p.m. , the court announced that a verdict had been reached, and there was a general exodus from the city center, as businesses closed and workers were sent home for the day. More camouflaged vehicles rolled into position, and soldiers carrying rifles materialized on the streets of downtown.\n\nAt Thirty-eighth Street and Chicago Avenue, next to a roadblock, a sign read \"You are now entering the free state of George Floyd.\" A perimeter of flowers, signs, and rope barriers covered in kente cloth surrounded the empty patch of street outside the Cup Foods grocery store, where Floyd was killed; an angel painted on the ground was outlined by votive candles in jars, with the words \"I can't breathe, I can't breathe\" written at its feet. The news that the verdict would soon be announced had arrived so suddenly that one person on the street stood dressed in a salon smock, her hair still in foils. Across the street from Cup Foods, under the awning of the former Speedway gas station, its sign now repainted \"People's Way,\" a black Jeep Wrangler had been left with the windows open, two dogs inside, and the news from the courtroom being played at high volume. A folding table was piled with cookies and other baked goods. Members of the media trained their cameras on a few people giving impromptu speeches as the rest of the crowd waited.\n\nA Black man wearing a Twins cap and a mask with \"#ICan'tBreathe\" written on it told me that his name was Gregory A. Lee and that he had lived three and a half blocks away since 1978. Racial profiling was at its worst in the nineteen-eighties, he said, and he had been pulled over dozens of times-in a baseball uniform after playing a game, in a suit coming from his job as a mortgage broker. Once, he said, he was driving with a white girlfriend and they were pulled over because of a crystal he had hung from his rearview mirror to reflect prisms of light. There were protests in the eighties and nineties, too, he said, but fewer white people came to them. \"We, as Black people, you know, we look at the police as basically a fraternity of racist white guys,\" he said.\n\nLee said that he probably frequented Cup Foods five times a week. \"For some reason, I've been beating myself up, because I didn't come to the store that day,\" he said, of the day Floyd was killed. He paused and put on a pair of sunglasses; he'd already said that he might get emotional. I asked whether he thought he might have done something. \"I would have,\" he said. \"I'm sixty-six and I live a good life; I've lived a great life. On that day, I would have felt I had nothing to lose.\"\n\nShouts began to ring out of \"Verdict! Verdict!\" and people gathered in clusters around phones, straining to hear over chants of \"Say his name!\" There was a moment of quiet, and then a voice shouted out \"guilty\"-no one knew which count, but the crowd erupted in screams. A woman next to me burst into tears as she held her phone to her ear, trying to listen. Lee raised his hands in the air in triumph. \"Guilty!\" the shouts continued, as the judge announced that the jury had convicted Chauvin on all three counts he faced. People hugged each other, and wept. It was not a joyful scene; it was something else. \"We shook up the world,\" a man in a maroon-and-gold University of Minnesota sweatshirt shouted, standing on a platform. On a changeable-letter sign that had once advertised gas-station prices, and that now read \" JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD ,\" a man began adding new letters, spelling out \"Justice served.\" After the cheer of the crowd died down, he added a question mark. Then there was a call: \"One down.\" And the response: \"Three to go!\" Three officers who were present when Chauvin murdered Floyd face charges of aiding and abetting.\n\nMore people from the neighborhood began to arrive, in couples and small groups, with children in tow. I ran into Lee again as he greeted some neighbors. \"I can't believe it's real,\" he said. He had spoken on the phone with a brother in Los Angeles, who asked him whether Minneapolis was going to burn. Lee said he didn't think so.\n\nWithin the hour, several hundred people gathered in downtown Minneapolis for a rally. It was a younger crowd, more eager to demonstrate. Some danced around a van with a loudspeaker playing Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright.\" A slow march past the plywood-covered storefronts began. The National Guard had dematerialized, and the police were nowhere to be seen, although helicopters hovered overhead. The crowd marched through the streets, chanting slogans that have become familiar. And they chanted the name of Daunte Wright, whose funeral will be held on Thursday, at the Shiloh Temple, in north Minneapolis.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Death of George Floyd, in Context\n\nTwo incidents separated by twelve hours and twelve hundred miles have taken on the appearance of the control and the variable in a grotesque experiment about race in America. On Monday morning, in New York City's Central Park, a white woman named Amy Cooper called 911 and told the dispatcher that an African-American man was threatening her. The man she was talking about, Christian Cooper, who is no relation, filmed the call on his phone. They were in the Ramble, a part of the park favored by bird-watchers, including Christian Cooper, and he had simply requested that she leash her dog-something that is required in the area. In the video, before making the call, Ms. Cooper warns Mr. Cooper that she is \"going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.\" Her needless inclusion of the race of the man she fears serves only to summon the ancient impulse to protect white womanhood from the threats posed by black men. For anyone with a long enough memory or a recent enough viewing of the series \" When They See Us ,\" the locale of this altercation becomes part of the story: we know what happened to five young black and brown men who were falsely accused of attacking a white woman in Central Park.\n\nOn Monday evening, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a forty-six-year-old black man named George Floyd died in a way that highlighted the implications that calls such as the one Amy Cooper placed can have; George Floyd is who Christian Cooper might have been. (The police made no arrests and filed no summons in Central Park. Amy Cooper has apologized for her actions; she was also fired from her job.) Police responding to a call from a shopkeeper, about someone trying to pass a potentially counterfeit bill, arrested Floyd. Surveillance video shows a compliant man being led away in handcuffs. But cellphone video later shows a white police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for seven minutes, despite protests from onlookers that his life is in jeopardy. In an echo of the police killing of Eric Garner , in 2014, Floyd repeatedly says, \"I can't breathe,\" and then, \"I'm about to die.\" When the officer eventually removes his knee, Floyd's body is limp and unresponsive. A person nearby can be heard saying, \"They just killed him.\" Floyd was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A police statement said that Floyd appeared to be in \"medical distress,\" but made no mention of his being pinned to the ground with the weight of a police officer compressing his airway.\n\nThe video of Floyd's death is horrific but not surprising; terrible but not unusual, depicting a kind of incident that is periodically reënacted in the United States. It's both necessary and, at this point, pedestrian to observe that policing in this country is mediated by race. On Tuesday, in Minneapolis, hundreds of protesters, many wearing face masks to guard against COVID -19, braved the pandemic to protest at the spot where Floyd died. Outside a nearby precinct house, police cars were pelted with rocks, and officers responded by firing tear gas. But, within twenty-four hours of the video coming to light, the Minneapolis Police Department fired the officer who had knelt on Floyd and three others who had been at the scene. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that the firings were \"the right call,\" but here, too, context matters.\n\nIn November, 2015, police responding to calls of a dispute between a man and a woman in north Minneapolis fatally shot a twenty-four-year-old African-American man named Jamar Clark. Police and paramedics on the scene claimed that Clark had resisted arrest and had attempted to grab an officer's gun; bystanders claimed that he was handcuffed and on the ground when the shot was fired. Clark's death was followed by more than two weeks of demonstrations outside the Fourth Police Precinct in Minneapolis, led by Black Lives Matter; an attempt to disrupt holiday shopping at the Mall of America, in protest; and cascading contempt from black residents that, two years later, factored into Mayor Betsy Hodges losing her reëlection bid. In light of that history, Frey has been unequivocal about police culpability in Floyd's death. \"Being black in America should not be a death sentence,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nThe larger question, however, is whether the officers involved will face any legal consequences. The Twin Cities area has been an outsized part of the dialogue about the police use of force. The year after Clark's death, Philando Castile was fatally shot in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, by a police officer who was alarmed because Castile had a gun in his car, even though he had identified himself as a licensed gun owner. (Castile's girlfriend recorded the aftermath of the shooting on her phone.) In 2017, Justine Damond was fatally shot by a police officer who was responding to her own call about a possible assault taking place behind her Minneapolis home. No charges were brought against officers in Clark's death. Jeronimo Yanez, the officer who killed Castile, was fired from the department, but was acquitted of second-degree-manslaughter charges. Mohamed Noor, the officer who shot Damond, was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and was sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison. The Damond case was atypical, both in that it involved the fatal shooting of a white woman by a black officer of Somali descent, and that Damond was an Australian citizen, which generated international pressure for a conviction in the case. No charges were brought against Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, on Staten Island, whose arrest was also recorded on video by a bystander, and has been widely referenced since Floyd's death. (He was fired from the department in 2019.) By odd coincidence,\" American Trial ,\" a film that features a mock trial of Pantaleo for murder, was just released.\n\nThe investigation into Floyd's death also exists in the context of an ongoing investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery , a twenty-five-year-old African-American who was shot in southeast Georgia when two men attempted to enact a citizen's arrest while a third recorded a video of the incident. There is yet another investigation of fatal police force in Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor, a twenty-six-year-old African-American E.M.T., was shot to death in her apartment by officers who were conducting a drug raid at what her family said was the wrong address.\n\nThere is more to be said about the burgeoning genre of videos capturing the deaths of black Americans, and the complex combination of revulsion and compulsion that accompanies their viewing. They are the macabre documentary of current events, but the question remains about whether they do more to humanize or to objectify the unwilling figures at the center of their narratives. Death is too intimate a phenomenon to not be distorted by a mass audience. Yesterday, very few of us knew who George Floyd was, what he cared about, how he lived his life. Today, we know him no better save for the grim way in which that life met its end.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "George Floyd, Houston's Protests, and Living Without the Benefit of the Doubt\n\nAbout a decade ago, I lived in Houston's Third Ward neighborhood, a few blocks away from Emancipation Park. It's the oldest park in Houston, and the oldest in Texas; during the Jim Crow era, as the Third Ward changed shape, it was the only park open to black city residents. There've been renovations to it in recent years-including the addition of a rec center with classrooms, a basketball court, and a cultural center-but it's one of the few spots in the area that's retained its autonomy in the midst of Houston's steadily advancing gentrification. On weekends, I'd bike down Elgin Street, hooking a right toward the park, before the shotgun houses and gas stations phase into town houses and skyscrapers; then I'd eat whatever sandwich I'd packed in my bag on one of the curbs at the park's edge. It usually wasn't very busy, but sometimes it was. It was mostly local folks, and mostly black and brown, but sometimes not. People congregated by the pool, or on the baseball field. Families played music and ate sitting on their cars just beside the fields of grass.\n\nLast week, a few hundred people gathered in the park to hold a vigil for George Floyd , the black man who was killed, in Minneapolis, on May 25th, when a police officer knelt on his neck-as he lay pinned face down, in handcuffs-for nearly nine minutes. Floyd grew up in the Third Ward. His family moved to Houston from North Carolina when he was a child, and lived in Cuney Homes, a housing project not too far from the park. Floyd came of age in the neighborhood; one of his teachers from elementary school, whom David Remnick spoke to over the weekend, saved an essay that Floyd wrote in the second grade about how he wanted to become a Supreme Court justice. He attended Jack Yates High School, where he played basketball and football-one year, he helped his team make it to the state championship, although they lost-before receiving a scholarship to play basketball in Florida. He returned to Texas to enroll at Texas A. & M-Kingsville, a few hours outside the city, where he also played. But, before the end of his sophomore year, Floyd made his way back to Houston.\n\nAt some point, back in the city, he fell in with the local rap scene. This would've been the early nineties, as Houston's oozing, lurching, chopped-and-screwed sound was expanding and distorting, molding the city's residents and reshaping our sense of Houston's cultural imprint. There's even a cameo from Floyd, under the name Big Floyd, on a DJ Screw mixtape, \"Sittin' on Top of the World\"; growing up, I heard the freestyles at least a handful of times floating from speakers in Alief, at parties or in the barbershop, or just out in the world, which was an achievement that any number of the city's burgeoning rap stars would've dreamed of. Floyd didn't ultimately seek out a music career, but in this quiet way he made himself inextricable from the neighborhood; he inhabited several realities simultaneously, in the way that the benefit of the doubt, when you're given it, can allow you to do. Ideally, Floyd would've been given the privilege, like so many in this country, of continuing that way.\n\nIn Houston, this past Friday, as protests swelled around the country, the police set up a cordon around the city, and occasionally a handful of squad cars blared down one road or another. By the time I arrived downtown, late in the afternoon, protesters had formed a wall between themselves and policemen on horseback. Helicopters flew above us, a handful of cops peered from the corners of nearby buildings, and a contingent of skateboarders who frequent the area circled both groups. The horses were a familiar sight: at a Houston protest for incarcerated undocumented children last year, seemingly a lifetime ago, police rode the animals, flanking protesters as we made our way through the city.\n\nBut the air felt palpably charged this time around: you could reach out and grab the anger. Nearly every protester wore a mask, or a scarf, or a sort of home-fashioned facial covering, which made an already balmy evening a little less tolerable-a reminder that our hands had been forced in the middle of a pandemic . Organizers maneuvered the crowd from one block to another, imploring people to allow cars to make their way through. The rap that blasted from car speakers mingled with the tinkling melody of an ice-cream truck, which drew a respectable line. Most of the protesters looked to be in their twenties and thirties. I passed a black couple walking their dogs alongside the protest's route, just across the street, who nodded; an older white couple holding signs; a gaggle of Latinx teens distributing water bottles. A handful of medical staff leaned against a building, smoking and raising their fists. Other passersby stood for a moment, watching the crowd progress along its path, before they returned to their own.\n\nBut the relative calm I witnessed was a product of my position and timing: later, I'd find out that an upswell I'd seen from the other end of the street was a young woman being trampled by a horse. Later in the evening, an hour or so after I'd made it out of downtown, the police department shut roadways in and out of the area, gridlocking the folks who hadn't yet left. Friday night, windows at the Bravery Chef Hall food court were smashed and items inside were looted, but the damage downtown was minimal . Still, more than a hundred protesters were arrested on Friday night, and a similar number on Saturday night. Another march downtown, toward City Hall, is planned for Tuesday afternoon.\n\nNaturally, the public conversation has begun to drift toward the question of what this moment means, and where we will go from here, and what this solidarity pledged en masse will tangibly yield. Over the weekend, friends of mine living abroad-veterans of their own protests-sent screenshots of tips for navigating riots. Other figures and entities, some of whom have profited off the amplification of diverse voices, remained silent. Some have taken pains to note the infiltration of the protests by \"outside agitators,\" while others have argued that the damage done to cities and businesses is a natural by-product of grief and exasperation. As ever, many things can be true simultaneously. But, at the end of the day, a man is dead. He was suffocated in the street, with a knee on his neck, under the guise of the law, and now he is gone.\n\nNot very long ago, a well-meaning white acquaintance asked me how it felt to incessantly think about living, in the United States, in the shadow of total police impunity. I answered, after blinking at him, by saying that I didn't incessantly think about it. Nor did I not incessantly think about it. It's just the same way that you (and you know who you are) don't think about putting one foot in front of the other. We have to go about our lives; at the same time, there is this thing right here, which is to say everywhere in this country, that might end it at any time. We still play in the park, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still snack in our living rooms, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still read in our cars, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still blast our favorite music, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still pull into the grocery-store parking lot, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still babysit, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still ring in the New Year, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still drive home from dinner with our partners, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still go out and about only to find ourselves misidentified, owing to an administrative error in an office somewhere, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still go for walks in the neighborhood, and we might be shot and killed for that. We still take naps at home, and we might be shot and killed for that. We can be killed for any of these things-or anything else, really-with total impunity for the killers.\n\nMaybe someone will record it. Maybe we'll become a hashtag, our existence flattened into the virtual universe of typed sentiments, joining a list that's only multiplied in the course of my adult life. Maybe not. Who knows. But it's enough to make us upset. Surely you can understand.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "George Floyd, the Tulsa Massacre, and Memorial Days\n\nThis year, Memorial Day, the national holiday on which we commemorate the men and women of the American military who died in the course of war, falls on May 31st, a date that marks the centennial anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, a racial pogrom in which the Black population of the prosperous Greenwood District of that city was attacked, murdered, and terrorized, leaving as many as three hundred dead. Last year, Memorial Day fell on May 25th, the day that George Floyd died, in the custody of a white Minneapolis police officer; the ineffable terribleness of the video depicting his death soon launched a wave of chaos and fury that swept across the nation. The massacre in Greenwood was just one outrage among a cluster of racially motivated eruptions that began in the aftermath of the First World War-the bloodletting in mid-1919 was so commonplace that the period came to be known as the Red Summer. The protracted brutality of Floyd's death sparked protests and uprisings in more than three hundred and fifty cities in the United States. These two Memorial Days point inescapably not only to those who have died on battlefields abroad but to the theatres of conflict at home and the freighted politics of race, grief, and culpability.\n\nThe Tulsa massacre erupted in response to rumors that a nineteen-year-old Black shoeshiner named Dick Rowland had assaulted a seventeen-year-old white elevator operator named Sarah Page. Rowland was arrested and held in the local jail, as armed white men began gathering outside. Armed Black men, many of them war veterans, fearing that Rowland would be lynched, also began arriving at the site. After the two groups exchanged gunfire, a mob of whites, many of them deputized by the local sheriff, poured into the Greenwood District, setting fires and waging indiscriminate warfare against the Black population. Private planes flew low over the destruction, and some witness accounts claimed that incendiaries were dropped onto the community below. By the end, roughly thirty blocks had been levelled, more than twelve hundred homes destroyed, and hundreds of people killed. The campaign left virtually the entire Black community homeless.\n\nThe immediate aftermath was marked by a different kind of campaign-one of erasure. Official documents disappeared, some victims were buried in unmarked graves, and accounts of the violence were excised from newspaper archives. As the Times has noted , \"City officials cleansed the history books so thoroughly that when Nancy Feldman, a lawyer from Illinois, started teaching at the University of Tulsa about the massacre in the late 1940s, they didn't believe her.\" So successful were these efforts that, seventy-four years later, when Timothy McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing a hundred and sixty-eight people, it was referred to as the first terrorist attack in the state's history. Last week, Lessie Benningfield Randle, who, at the age of a hundred and six, is one of the three oldest known witnesses to the massacre, told a congressional committee , \"I was so scared. I didn't think we could make it out alive.\"\n\nNinety-nine years separate the tragedy that took place in Tulsa from the one that occurred last May in Minneapolis, two very different incidents in very different times. Yet they share commonalities. The violence in Tulsa was orchestrated by mobs but also overseen by law enforcement and deputized civilians. The erasure in Floyd's case began immediately after he died, with a police report stating that he had expired as the result of a \"medical incident during police interaction,\" while making no mention of the fact that an officer had held his knee on Floyd's neck. But for a cell-phone video shot by a seventeen-year-old, Darnella Frazier, the official-and false-account of Floyd's death might have held. It's possible to compare the wake of Tulsa with the aftermath of Floyd's death and find a narrative of progress. In 2001, a bipartisan commission in Oklahoma issued a report on the origins, scope, and impact of the Tulsa massacre. But, despite the report's evidence of the culpability of government actors, the state of Oklahoma has yet to compensate the survivors of the attack or the descendants of the victims. By contrast, the city of Minneapolis agreed to a twenty-seven-million-dollar settlement with Floyd's family. The perpetrators of the Tulsa massacre were allowed to live out their remaining years untroubled by legal inquiry; the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on three counts in Floyd's death, and the prosecution has argued that there are aggravating factors which could prolong any sentence he receives. The moral indictment that Tulsa represented vanished seemingly as soon as the smoke from the smoldering homes had dissipated. But the shock at the brutality captured on video last year prompted a national reckoning with race, and spurred an outpouring of condemnation and of mercenary, albeit important, endorsements of the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" from the staid corners of the corporate world.\n\nGeorge Floyd's family members visited President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House on Tuesday. Biden set this date, the actual anniversary of Floyd's death, as a deadline for introducing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a reform package which passed the House and whose particulars are now being hammered out by Senators Cory Booker, Tim Scott, and others. (Scott has indicated that they are close to a deal that could receive enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate.) Yet the question remains of whether Floyd's case will represent any substantive change in how police killings of unarmed citizens will be handled. His death occurred in broad daylight, under unambiguous circumstances witnessed by multiple people, and was video-recorded from multiple angles. Amid the national push to make Floyd's murder a national learning moment, it has become apparent that not all learning can be equated with progress.\n\nOn April 21st, police in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, fired fourteen rounds at the forty-two-year-old Andrew Brown, Jr., striking him once fatally in the back of the head, while serving drug-related arrest warrants. Police stonewalled in response to public demands that body-cam footage of the incident be released. On May 18th, the district attorney R. Andrew Womble announced that the shooting was \"justified,\" given that Brown, who was attempting to drive away, was in possession of a potentially deadly weapon-his car. (Parts of the video, which the Times reviewed , reportedly show the cluster of bullets that likely killed Brown being fired when the car is moving away from the officers.) It's not difficult to imagine that police in Elizabeth City recognized the importance of preventing the public from seeing the video before Womble announced the decision, having seen the centrality of video evidence to outrage in the Floyd case. Floyd's death has been to one community an object lesson in what police should not do, and to another a lesson in how police might be shielded from consequences for their actions. Time will tell which has the greater impact.\n\nThere's another connection between what happened in May, 1921, and in May, 2020. Viola Ford Fletcher, who is a hundred and seven, also testified before Congress about Tulsa last week, and said that she could still see \"Black bodies lying in the street.\" She added, \"I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day.\" Witness testimony in Derek Chauvin's trial yielded a view into the ongoing trauma of those who watched George Floyd die as they pleaded for him to be spared. Charles McMillian, who testified for the prosecution, sobbed so uncontrollably on the stand that the judge had to call a recess. In the days after Floyd's death, McMillian confessed to a journalist that he woke up each morning hearing Floyd's anguished cries for his mother. The fact that these events have fallen on Memorial Day make for easy inferences about the importance of commemoration. But this is not how trauma works, particularly for those who are closest to the calamity. It's not the necessity of remembrance that serves as a burden. It's the inability to forget, even if you want to.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Bears Responsibility for George Floyd's Death\n\nThe murder of George Floyd one year ago by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin once again exposed the gaping chasm between our Constitution's promises and the reality of policing in America. While the criminal conviction of Derek Chauvin by a Minneapolis jury provides some accountability for Floyd's murder, our current system has done little to stanch the flood of police violence that took Floyd's life-and the lives of so many others-because the Supreme Court has repeatedly gutted one of our most important federal civil rights laws.\n\nCongress must begin the work of repairing our system of constitutional accountability by undoing the court's decimation of one key law. Known as Section 1983, the law allows individuals to go to court to redress violations of constitutional rights by state and local governments and their agents. The Supreme Court, though, over the years has eviscerated it by inventing doctrines found nowhere in the text or history of the law.\n\nIn order to enforce the 14 th Amendment, Section 1983 provides that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\" subjects any person \"to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured\" in a court of law. Enacted in 1871 against the backdrop of horrific state and Ku Klux Klan violence aimed at undoing Reconstruction's promises of racial justice, Section 1983 gave those victimized by official abuse of power a critically important tool to hold governments and their agents accountable in a court of law. The law aimed to stop state actors and others from killing, brutalizing, and terrorizing Black people with impunity.\n\nTo this end, the text of Section 1983 does not recognize any immunities from accountability.\n\nCongress made a conscious choice not to provide any official immunities because it sought to hold state officials accountable for violating constitutional rights, not to permit such officials to flout the law with impunity.\n\nWhat is less well-known is that Congress explicitly rejected the idea that persons should be exempt from responsibility simply because they held a position of power. Congress modeled Section 1983's design of constitutional accountability on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which contained criminal penalties against state officials that violated the law's prohibitions on racial discrimination. In debates over this precursor to Section 1983, the law's supporters insisted that official immunities are akin to the idea that \" the King can do no wrong \" and wrongfully \" places officials above the law .\" Section 1983 incorporated an identical remedial framework. Section 1983, like the 1866 Act, did not provide any immunities because Congress refused to place officials \"above the law.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly insisted that the court's role in statutory interpretation is to enforce the plain meaning of the words chosen by Congress. But it has repeatedly ignored the text, context, and history of Section 1983, doing violence to the language chosen by Congress. By gutting Section 1983 through judicial fiat, the Supreme Court has let state and local governments and their agents violate our most cherished constitutional rights with impunity and left those victimized by abuse of power without any remedy.\n\nIn its cases interpreting-or rather rewriting-Section 1983, the Supreme Court has made the words \"clearly established\" and \"policy\" paramount. Let's start with \"clearly established.\" Under the judicially created doctrine of qualified immunity , a suit against a government officer must be dismissed unless the state or local officer violated clearly established constitutional rights. In practice, unless the plaintiff can point to a prior precedent with essentially identical facts, courts insist that the law is not clearly established. That means that much of the time, constitutional violations go unremedied and justice is denied to those victimized by abuse of power . Moreover, because a court can dismiss a case without ruling on whether the official violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights, the contours of constitutional rights may remain frozen in place, preventing rights from ever becoming clearly established and bolting the courthouse doors firmly shut to those aggrieved by official abuse of power.\n\nThe word \"policy\" is equally important to the story of how the Supreme Court has gutted Section 1983. Employers in the private sector are liable for the legal wrongs committed by their employees and agents , but the Supreme Court has refused to apply this longstanding principle of accountability to municipalities. Instead, local governments, with few exceptions, cannot be held liable for constitutional violations committed by their officers and agents within the scope of their duties. As a result, one of the most powerful tools for systemic reform -holding the government itself liable-is off the table.\n\nIn the 1978 case of Monell v. Department of Social Services , the Supreme Court held in essence that a city can only be held liable if a municipal \"policy\" caused the constitutional deprivation. (A municipal custom will count as well, but the court has basically ignored that category entirely.) The \"policy\" requirement for local governmental liability, like qualified immunity's \"clearly established\" law requirement, is a dead end for accountability. The last time the Supreme Court held that a municipal \"policy\" caused a constitutional violation was in 1986, more than three decades ago.\n\nRead the text of Section 1983. You will not find \"clearly established\" or \"policy\" in the language enacted into law by Congress. The Supreme Court simply made these words up to allow the government and its agents to evade accountability. As Justice John Paul Stevens put it in denouncing the policy requirement for governmental liability, it is \" judicial legislation of the most blatant kind .\"\n\nBy creating a nearly insurmountable barrier to suing the officer who violated someone's constitutional rights and the government that made the officer's abuse of power possible, the Supreme Court's judicially-created doctrines operate synergistically to allow constitutional rights to be violated with impunity. Together they form a system of government unaccountability. As a result, the cycle of racialized policing and racial violence that took George Floyd's life continues unchecked. And policing is just one small slice of the abuses Section 1983 concerns. By gutting Section 1983 in a myriad of ways, the court has sanctioned deprivations of free speech , allowed prosecutors to destroy innocent lives , and let abuse of power in prison flourish . Rather than giving full effect to a law designed to enforce the 14 th Amendment, the Supreme Court has gutted it to protect governments and their agents and legitimize violations of constitutional rights.\n\nCongress can change this. One year after the killing of George Floyd, Congress has the opportunity and the responsibility to begin repairing our system of constitutional accountability and to ensure that our most cherished constitutional guarantees do not exist merely on paper. The only way to fix the long line of immunity doctrines devised by the court is to end them and ensure that those victimized by the government can seek justice in the courts.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin Convicted of Murdering George Floyd\n\nDerek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was convicted on all counts on Tuesday. Chauvin faced charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter in Floyd's death, which helped set off mass protests around the world. Sentencing will occur in eight weeks.\n\nDuring the trial,  the two sides argued over what exactly caused Floyd's death and whether Chauvin was justified in his use of force. The prosecution called to the stand bystanders who relayed the horror of witnessing Floyd's death and at times broke down in tears. Paramedics testified that they could find no signs of life upon their arrival. One of Chauvin's fellow officers decried his actions as excessive. And prosecutors repeatedly played the surveillance video, which gave the public a disturbing and uninterrupted view of Floyd's desperate pleas and Chauvin's indifference. The prosecutors urged the jurors to \"trust their eyes.\"\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThe defense, meanwhile, argued that Floyd had died not from a lack of oxygen but from a cardiac arrhythmia, possibly caused by drug use, heart disease, or even carbon monoxide from the exhaust of the police car. The defense also argued that the prone position that Floyd was forced into-one that has become increasingly criticized as dangerous-was not an excessive use of force. The prosecution countered both of these claims with experts of its own.\n\nChauvin declined to testify in his own defense.\n\nOn May 25, Floyd stopped to buy cigarettes from a convenience store and returned to his car. An employee at that store believed that the $20 bill he used was counterfeit and called the police . Chauvin and three other members of the Minneapolis Police Department arrived and accosted Floyd, claiming in a statement that they believed he was \"under the influence.\" Floyd opened his car door, and one of the officers yelled at Floyd and forcefully pulled him out of the car. The officers handcuffed Floyd and marched him to their police car. Floyd objected and tried to exit from the other side of the car, saying he wanted to lie on the ground. The officers then pinned Floyd to the ground, and Chauvin pressed his knee to Floyd's neck.\n\nFloyd told the officers, repeatedly, that he could not breathe. Bystanders began shouting at the officers, and after six minutes, one of the officers checked Floyd's pulse. He couldn't find it; two minutes later, paramedics arrived. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck after Floyd lost consciousness, and for more than a minute after paramedics arrived. Floyd was pronounced dead that evening.\n\nAll four of the officers involved were fired the next day.  The other officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao, were also charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\n\nOn April 11, as Chauvin's trial was underway, yet another Black man in the community was killed by the police-this time, after a traffic stop and by an officer who claimed she mixed up a gun and a Taser . The shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, led to unrest and days of protests. Some of Floyd's family members joined Wright's relatives at their first public press conference to call for consequences for the police officer. \"Police officers are killing us,\" said Floyd's brother Philonese. \"We're here and we will fight for justice for this family, just like we're fighting for our brother.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Media Is Finally Addressing Its Police Report Problem\n\nThe original press release from the Minneapolis Police Department about George Floyd's murder was a lie.\n\nBy the police account, the murder was not even an act of killing. Under the title \"Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction,\" the release claimed that Floyd had resisted arrest and then suffered \"medical distress\" after being cuffed. That is a drastically reduced description of what actually occurred when Derek Chauvin murdered Floyd. Nowhere does the release mention that the medical distress was brought on by Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds -as Floyd experienced seizures and cried out for help, in front of multiple eyewitnesses. In video footage of the arrest, Floyd's only visible resistance to the officers is his falling to his knees and saying he's claustrophobic.\n\nThe press release resurfaced following Chauvin's conviction, and it renewed a conversation about how, exactly, news outlets should report information that comes from law enforcement officials when the police have killed or injured a civilian. Historically, journalists have tended to defer to police reports as the default narratives around crime and violence; the police are, after all, consistently there as sources at otherwise confusing and unpredictable scenes, and their accounts have the authority of the government behind them. But Floyd's murder presents another challenge to that long-held standard, especially when the police are active participants in the stories they tell.\n\nAs witnesses' cellphone footage has captured more acts of police violence, and as officers' body cameras have kept contradicting their own accounts of events, news outlets have begun couching their coverage of police reports in more skeptical terms. Again and again, law enforcement officials themselves end up revising or retracting essential parts of their stories of what happened. But the old habit remains a powerful one.\n\nKat Stafford, an investigative reporter for the Associated Press, explained in a Twitter thread it's vital that journalists not act as stenographers for the police but instead investigate their account as thoroughly as we would any civilian's.\n\nJournalists will ask people they interview to produce documents and all sorts of proof to make sure that their stories are solid, right? Fact check and verification, line by line in some cases. Why does that level of skepticism not translate to law enforcement agencies?\n\nHow will this knowledge translate into policy for journalists? I asked a number of major news organizations if they planned to change their newsroom standards or guidelines about how to report on information provided by police officers and departments. CBS News said it has been \"reporting on this issue on and off air.\" A spokesperson for the Associated Press said: \"AP's guidance is to treat police statements, like any source of official information, with due skepticism, and question it closely, speak to all parties involved in a particular situation and do our own due diligence. Police information should be attributed properly and not stated as fact.\" The AP spokesperson also pointed to this story addressing the topic following Floyd's murder.\n\nThe Washington Post said its policy is to \"disclose to readers the sources of information in our stories, to the maximum possible extent. When we find that individuals or institutions have misled the public or The Post, we cover that failing, as our reporting on the death of George Floyd demonstrates.\"\n\n(Slate's own official statement on the subject was: \"We don't have a police-specific policy, but our editorial approach is, and will continue to be, to use discretion, fact-check and properly contextualize and frame information provided by police officers and departments. Statements from law enforcement officials can be important and newsworthy developments in a story, but we believe it is our job as a news organization to verify and hold those officials, and the information they provide, to account, just as we strive to do with every source.\")\n\nIn an interview with Slate, two officials for the Gannett newspaper chain described an ongoing set of coverage reforms that are starting within the company's Atlantic region and are meant to be rolled out companywide-part of what they said was a larger reckoning with how to cover policing and crime. As they talked to the public about the company's journalism, Michael Kilian, Gannett's New York state editor, said, \"it became quickly clear that public safety coverage was the big impediment to trust.\"\n\nThe revised approach includes a policy of not writing about a crime or arrest unless the underlying case would be in the public's interest and would merit continued coverage as it passes through the court system. Gannett also avoids publishing police mug shots except in special circumstances-such as if the person is a prominent figure or poses a significant danger to the public-and emphasizes the need for reporters to speak to other people at the scene and in the surrounding community rather than directly publishing the police narrative.\n\n\"I read the police report from Minneapolis, and it took a leave from reality,\" said Hollis R. Towns, the vice president of local news initiatives at Gannett. \"There were a lot of omissions in that police report and a characterization in that police report that was not reflective of what was actually happening on the ground or what happened when George Floyd was taken into custody.\"\n\n\"For many, many years, we've accepted the gospel from police as [the] true religion, and we haven't pushed back,\" Towns said. \"We've accepted it as it is. And I think what this approach does is to look at that differently. That the police are offering one viewpoint on what may have happened.\"\n\nKilian noted that even referring to police as \"the authorities\" in a news story was being discussed, since it further reinforces a historical lack of scrutiny given to law enforcement.\n\n\"We don't call the mayor 'the authority' or President Biden or anybody else,\" he said. \"It puts us in a position of being almost subservient, or subordinate, to the police information. And that is something that's so built in. If we go back and read police news from a year ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago, we can see that.\"\n\n\"We have to cure ourselves of that and treat them as one more source that we should be skeptical of,\" he added, \"and find what the full story is.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin Goes on Trial\n\nSubscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts for the full episode.\n\nLast May, the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a global movement against racism and police brutality. The city of Minneapolis is gearing up again for potential unrest as prosecutors move ahead this week with the trail for that police officer, Derek Chauvin. On Monday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Minnesota Public Radio senior report Jon Collins about how that pursuit of legal accountability is taking shape in Minneapolis and why the path forward is anything but guaranteed. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Part of the reason I wanted to talk to you about the trial is that you've covered criminal justice issues in and around Minneapolis for a long time. And so you see this case a s not just one case but part of a larger pattern in the state. C an explain that a bit ?\n\nJon Collins: So in Minnesota, like many other places, we've had high-profile killings of civilians by police officers for decades and decades. The relationship specifically between the Black community in Minneapolis and police has never been good. Police misconduct has been at the root of a lot of tensions. We could go all the way back to 1966, 1967, when there were riots in the north part of the city; it was police misconduct that sparked those. And we've had so many high-profile shooting deaths, mostly of Black men by police officers, that people I talk to say that every time something happens, whether it's in Minneapolis or in the suburbs or St. Paul, that the trauma that they feel builds. So the reaction has also built into pressure that was put on prosecutors to have accountability.\n\nYou've talked about this snowballing effect, but I was struck that your attorney general, Keith Ellison , has been pretty honest that prosecuting police officers is hard. And he's pointed out that the county attorney for Hennepin County involved in this case is the only prosecutor in the state who successfully prosecuted a police officer for murder, which is pretty remarkable.\n\nWe've only had one police officer who's been convicted in the state for killing someone on duty. We've had three trials so far, and the other two have been exonerated. In Minnesota, like in many other states, because of the protections that police officers are given under the law-because the law does acknowledge that their jobs are hard, that they're dangerous, that they do have authority to use force-it can be really difficult to get successful charges. And traditionally, jurors are sympathetic to police because they understand that it can be a tough and dangerous job.\n\nAnd this isn't a shooting death. It's a death where Derek Chauvin put his knee on George Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes. And that kind of restraint , I've read, has never led to serious charges like this before.\n\nNormally when we cover these trials-this will be the fourth trial of a police officer in Minnesota for killing someone-one thing that's at the heart of arguments from the defense is that you can't legally use 20/20 hindsight and say, \"Hey, I knew that Philando Castile was not up to any trouble\" or whatever. The jury has to consider what a reasonable police officer would do at the time, knowing what they knew and having to make a split-second decision. So that has given officers a lot of leeway. But this case involves, as you said, an officer who didn't make a split-second decision; he made a decision for nine minutes to kneel on George Floyd's neck, so that changes this case and makes it different than any other case that we've had with police officers in Minnesota.\n\nYou've got a city where everyone has seen what's happened over the past year- the protests -b ut we also have this pandemic going on. And tha t's a really dicey circumstance to be choosing a jury in because everyone probably has an opinion on what took place, and no one really wants to be in the same room together. H ow's that moving forward?\n\nProsecutors really wanted to push the trial back. Their argument was that holding a trial during a pandemic before many people are vaccinated in the state presents not only a danger to the people who have to be in the courtroom but to the public if there are protests or large gatherings. And the judge declined to move Chauvin's trial. Because there are such restrictions on who can gather in the courtroom proper, we're not going to have much media presence or any members of the public, really, that are allowed in the courtroom. There's just not space to keep it safe. And so what they're doing is allowing the media to livestream from different cameras in the courtroom to our organizations.\n\nAnd typically, there aren't cameras in the courtroom\n\nYeah, Minnesota never allows cameras in the courtroom. You can't have a recording, and you certainly can't take pictures or anything. It's one of the more restrictive court systems in the country.\n\nI read that the jurors are being mailed , like , 14 pages of questions about all kinds of things, about how they feel about the police and conspiracy theories and the media.\n\nYeah, and Black Lives Matter and what their experiences are with the court system, with police officers. They really want to give these attorneys what these people's backgrounds are and beliefs and see if they can fairly assess whether an officer did commit a crime or not.\n\nAs of the time that we're recording this, what Derek Chauvin is being charged with is actually still being decided. That's because prosecutors want to charge him with second-degree unintentional murder, second-degree manslaughter, and third-degree murder. In Minnesota, third - degree murder has typically been reserved for a case in which more than one person has been put at risk-say, if someone shoots into a crowd. But the state attorney general would like to expand this definition.\n\nProsecutors are pushing yet again to get third-degree murder reinstated. And we still don't know exactly how that is going to pan out, but it would make it way more difficult for Derek Chauvin and his attorney to defend him against three separate charges.\n\nWhy is that harder?\n\nIt restricts the arguments that he can make to say that it's not his fault or to say that it was self-defense, because he now has to avoid implicating himself for third-degree murder. So it's more challenging legally, and it restricts the arguments that he can make to defend himself.\n\nDo you look at this changing interpretation of what third-degree murder is in Minnesota as meaningful in terms of what prosecutors are now willing to do? How aggressively they want to pursue charges against police officers?\n\nSomeone I was talking to the other day-an attorney-was arguing that maybe the changing case law, the way the appeals court interpreted third-degree murder, means that that is a charge that can be successfully prosecuted against police officers if they have this broader definition of that. If it is upheld by the state Supreme Court, where it's headed now, that could potentially be one more and maybe a more solid tool for prosecutors in future prosecutions if they do have incidents where police kill someone.\n\nLet's turn to Derek Chauvin, who is accused of killing George Floyd. I should say police encountered George Floyd after an employee of a corner store, a place called CUP Foods , alleged he might have been trying to use counterfeit money. So what do we know about Chauvin? What have we learned about him in the p ast few months?\n\nDerek Chauvin is a veteran police officer. He was the senior officer. He's been essentially the trainer-think of him as the mentor for younger officers, showing them the ropes. We do know that he has a pretty extensive number of complaints about him, most of which were not substantiated. And we don't know what they were exactly, but some of that will come up at trial.\n\nI think you said 22 complaints in 19 years.\n\nIt's hard to tell with Minneapolis police because if they're not substantiated, we don't know what they are. And in many cases, there's not any sort of punishment or discipline that's meted out. In Minneapolis, police have a history of doing this thing where they essentially coach the officer who did something, and they don't consider discipline. So it often doesn't become public.\n\nSo if someone does something wrong, instead of referring it as a complaint, they gently correct an officer.\n\nYeah, exactly. It's something that critics will argue makes it difficult to keep officers who are abusive or overstep their authority accountable.\n\nI know your colleagues have spoken to some people who complained about Derek Chauvin and were even choked before George Floyd died. I wonder what you learned from those cases.\n\nSome of them look really similar to other cases that we've seen in the city. It points to how entrenched Minneapolis police culture is. Chauvin's attorney will make the argument at trial that using that sort of hold on George Floyd was not something they were taught not to do. And it's something that maybe even came up using during some trainings.\n\nAnother defense that I've heard in this case is that George Floyd died with drugs in his system, and he had underlying health problems, and that those weren't due to anything Derek Chauvin did. Do you think we'll be hearing about that as well?\n\nThat's really at the heart of the case. What Chauvin's attorneys are going to be arguing is that George Floyd died not because of a knee on his neck, but because he had methamphetamines and fentanyl in his system and he had heart problems or long-term health problems that contributed. The prosecutors will argue that the knee is the most important factor in why he died, because without it, he still would have had these underlying health problems, he still would have had drugs in his system, but he would have been alive.\n\nIt strikes me that these trials aren't the only way to hold the police accountable for what happened with George Floyd. There was so much conversation months ago about defunding the police in Minneapolis. What happened with that?\n\nMinneapolis contributed to the national dialogue with vows from the majority of our City Council to essentially defund the police. It turned out that that was more complicated than they thought. Their vision is still in process. Essentially, Minneapolis is required to maintain a certain level of police from our city charter. And City Council members have been trying to change that wording to make it so that Minneapolis doesn't have to maintain a certain number of Minneapolis police officers and can create a new Department of Public Safety. But as of now, the council has slightly cut the Minneapolis Police Department's budget. They took more than a million dollars and moved it over to the Office of Violence Prevention. And then there have been quite a few policy changes as well, both at the city level and then state mandates.\n\nLike what?\n\nMayor Jacob Frey has announced policies like changing the times when officers are given the authority to use force, changing how they report when they do use force, restricting things like no-knock warrants\n\nWhat's changed at the state level since May?\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered the city to ban the use of chokeholds by Minneapolis police and to require officers to intervene if they see a colleague of theirs using force that's not authorized.\n\nAnd the state Legislature also passed legislation. Lots of activists said it didn't go far enough, but it did include a ban on the so-called warrior training , this very aggressive militaristic training. And then, some sorts of trainings that teach officers how to deal with people who have autism.\n\nIs there anyone out there talking explicitly about ways to change the culture of the Minneapolis police? Because it seems like such a tricky thing to do but also so vital.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey has said that's one of his priorities. But do we know that it's making any impact or difference? The daily lived experience of people is going to tell us that.\n\nYou've covered a lot of trials like this one in the Minneapolis area. Are there particular signs you're looking for as this trial plays out that will indicate what's going on behind the scenes?\n\nOne thing that will be very interesting is how other officers, not even folks who are charged, will testify. Say, folks who were called to the protest right after George Floyd was killed. What were they saying on their body cameras to other officers? And what does that tell us about how they view the public and how they viewed this incident from the very beginning? There is famously a phrase that law enforcement will often use when on-duty killings are talked about, and they will say, \"It's lawful, but it's awful,\" essentially meaning it doesn't look good, but it's not illegal. I'm curious to see how officers talked to each other in the minutes after this happened and whether they knew that potentially this was going to be a bigger issue than even a typical high-profile police killing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "When the Verdict Came Down\n\nAbout 30 minutes before the verdict against Derek Chauvin was announced, I stood steps from where George Floyd was murdered. I looked at the ground. I was with Marcia Howard, the unofficial guardian of the square that now bears Floyd's name. \"Today we get to see whether or not the people of Minneapolis can look at something with their bare eyes and not get gaslit into thinking that they didn't see what they saw,\" she said.\n\nI had never seen Howard, a former Marine who lives a couple hundred steps from this spot, very excited before. But she was now. This was the most crowded the intersection has been since last summer. The crowd swelled to hundreds gathered to listen to the verdict together. There were the usual chants: \"Say his name! George Floyd!\" But others, I noticed, stood silently. The events of the past year here were slowly coming to a head. One woman nearby simply sobbed. The anticipation overwhelmed her with anxiety. \"I want to be hopeful. It's got to be justice this time because I can't take another one,\" she said. She said she'd been coming to the square to share hope, but in that moment, she was the one who needed consoling. \"My heart can't take it,\" she said. \"I need justice.\"\n\nAs the time inched closer to the planned announcement for the verdict, the square got busier and louder. A car parked in the abandoned Speedway station at the intersection streamed the audio from the courtroom loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\nThen the judge began reading the verdict. It was sudden. I could barely hear it over the shrieks and cheers coming from all around me: Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts. In a space where I've come to witness so much pain , it was overcome with bliss. It was a mass wave of catharsis. The woman I had been speaking to burst into tears again, this time of joy. \"We matter!\" she shouted over and over in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"This is the first deep breath I've been able to take in months,\" said Anthony Galloway, who grew up in the Twin Cities and was there as a chaplain. \"Time to take care of all these folks who have been holding their breath all this time, too,\" he said as he walked off.\n\nCup Foods, where a teenage clerk called 911 after an encounter with Floyd before his murder, shut down for a few hours today to give visitors space to witness the verdict. Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, one of the co-owners of Cup, told me he was overjoyed. \"We can finally say that justice has been served. George Floyd and his family can now have peace of mind,\" he said.\n\nAlicia Smith, a community organizer who lives near the intersection, was also in an exalted mood, but seemed less certain what the moment meant. \"I'm still unsure of what to make of it,\" she told me. \"It's a hydration break, that's what I'm going to call it.\" The last time we spoke , she told me she had little faith the verdict would come back guilty. \"This is something we've never seen in the history of this state,\" she said. \"Today, I feel optimistic about the future of our quest for justice.\"\n\nNearby, Howard began to lead a chant, referring to the three other officers who will be tried this summer : \"One down! Three to go!\"\n\nIn one of the more surreal sights of the afternoon, someone brought stacks of cash and made it rain on the people gathered: first $20s, then $1s. Bills were everywhere. I asked the woman with the tote bag of money what she was doing. She told me she worked for Sabri Properties, a property management group in Minneapolis, and she called it a \"gift to the community.\"\n\nThe stewards of the square were not pleased. One activist who's lived in Minneapolis since the '90s yelled for it to stop. \"Donate this money to the family,\" he shouted. People started to gather the cash and stack it together near the memorial.\n\nAs the time passed, more sobriety set in. \"There's the illusion that George Floyd got justice,\" said Link, an organizer who has been in the intersection since the Floyd died. He didn't begrudge the infectious joy spreading in the square: \"I like to see everybody happy out here and whatnot,\" he said, but \"I just hope people don't get complacent. We got a guilty verdict of Derek Chauvin, but there's still so much stuff left to do. It's a battle won in the war.\"\n\nHoward held back some joy too. She tried to stay composed for the community she'd help foster over the last year. \"There's so much work that we've done, but there's so much work that's left to do. It is only a first step,\" she said.\n\nShe stood and watched as someone changed the marquee on the abandoned Speedway.

      "text": "The Store That Called the Cops on George Floyd\n\nShortly after 8 p.m. on Memorial Day, May 25, Mahmoud \"Mike\" Abumayyaleh got a panicked phone call from a teenage employee at the store he owns with his three brothers. \"Mike! Mike! They're killing him,\" she said. \"My heart dropped. Like, it fell to the ground,\" Mahmoud told me. He had no clue what she was talking about. At first, he assumed a customer was accosting a worker.\n\nFrantically, his employee explained what was happening: A police officer had pinned a customer to the ground outside the store, and that man was saying he couldn't breathe. Mahmoud manages the day shift at CUP Foods at the corner of 38 th Street and Chicago Avenue in southern Minneapolis, but that night, young employees were working the store alone. There'd been a brief confrontation with a man accused of passing a fake bill. Then an 18-year-old clerk dialed 911. The man was named George Floyd, and minutes later, a cop was kneeling on his neck.\n\nBy the afternoon after Floyd's killing, CUP Foods' voicemail box was full. As the day wore on, a devastated and furious group began to gather at the intersection. They chanted, prayed, and consoled one another. Outside the shop, numbers swelled into the thousands.\n\nIn the months that followed, the intersection would become a fortress of grief and protest with sculptures, murals, and constant visitors. Armed groups would patrol the area, and police would stay on the other side of barricades. The store would be vandalized repeatedly, with \"FUCK CUP FOODS\" spray-painted on the exterior. Even longtime customers would question whether it ever deserved to reopen. The Abumayyaleh brothers would fret over lowball offers to buy them out after Friday prayers at the mosque in the store's basement and struggle to imagine a future for a family business with a complicated past.\n\nBut in those first days, they were only sure of one thing. \"Between the phone calls, threats, the protesters outside,\" Mahmoud said, he and his brothers decided they had to temporarily shut down. He said he believed that most of the threats CUP Foods was getting were a form of grief, expressions of outrage from people who felt powerless after watching another Black man get killed by police. But he still didn't know what might happen. When the brothers closed the doors, they had no idea if they'd ever reopen at all.\n\nMore than 30 years ago, Samir Abumayyaleh had a choice to make. Born in Palestine, he was the oldest son of a family that arrived to the United States when he was a child. The family moved to North Minneapolis to open a small convenience store. When Samir graduated high school in 1989, he could either go to college or start his own shop like his father, Hamadeh, had and help stabilize the finances for his parents and their 10 kids. He found an opportunity to lease a promising space on the other side of town, in South Minneapolis. The property had once been a drugstore and sat at the intersection of four neighborhoods. Samir went for it. He called his tiny corner store Chicago Unbeatable Prices, later shortened to just CUP. Over time, it expanded to include a deli, a cellphone repair shop, a notary public, and MoneyGram services.\n\nIn its early years, only Samir and his parents worked in the store. They would sit outside, sipping coffee and tea, handling sporadic customers, while the kids ran around playing inside. As soon as his younger brothers were old enough-maybe before they were-they started to take shifts at the store too.\n\nSix years ago, Samir passed off responsibility for managing the store to three of his siblings, Mahmoud, Nabil, and Ahmad, though he's still a familiar figure there, known to most people as \"Sam.\" Samir is now 49 years old, and his hair is white and thick. He assertively leans forward when talking, but his voice is soft. He is eager to see business return to normal, but, he told me, as a native Palestinian, he understands the frustration coming from the protesters outside. \"God made this happen for a reason,\" he said in Arabic. \"It started a real reckoning that was needed. The way these cops treat Black people here can never be justified.\"\n\nSamir's younger brothers have spent their entire lives on this corner. \"I started working when I was like 12, 11,\" said Mahmoud, who is now 36, and only agreed to be interviewed inside the shop if he could keep working and answering calls while we talked. \"I started working full time when I was 15, seven days a week, during school, no breaks. And by the time I was 17, I was holding a shift by myself. And by the time I got to 21, 22, I got married, and by 25, I was holding the store down by myself.\" Mahmoud now has four kids, one of whom, at 13, already works at the store.\n\nSamir's youngest brother, Ahmad, 32, manages the night shift. There are enough years between Ahmad and Samir to make him Samir's child. He was only 1 year old when CUP Foods opened. \"A lot of customers remember me in diapers. I swear, I have pictures with them,\" he said. In college, he imagined a career outside of his family's business. He studied computer engineering and even got a corporate job after he graduated, still taking occasional shifts at CUP. But now, he's invested in keeping the store running and in the family.\n\nNabil, 46, once managed the store but now looks after some of the 15 or so other properties the brothers own. Their buildings house a laundromat, a barber shop, and other businesses in neighborhoods around Minneapolis and St. Paul. Nabil has three sons who take regular shifts behind the counter at CUP Foods, and the brothers hope they will become the next generation of managers. \"I'm trying to pass it on to them,\" he said. \"They won't have to work for somebody else.\"\n\nThe four Abumayyaleh brothers now co-own the shop together. There are reminders of their parents everywhere. A portrait of Hamadeh, who died in 2012, hangs on the wall behind the register. A recorded recitation of the Quran plays on repeat off one of the computers, just like it did when their parents ran CUP Foods. The mosque in the basement, used by Muslims who work at local stores, auto shops, and restaurants, is dedicated to their mother's memory: It's called Masjid Ni'mat ul -Islaam . Her name was Ni'mat. \"Our Mama, God rest her soul, when she was alive, she made me promise,\" Mahmoud said, \" 'Don't ever sell this business.' \"\n\nDuring the first week after Floyd's killing, someone threw a rock through CUP Foods' window. When I first visited in late July, the brothers still hadn't fixed it. A large wooden board covered part of the storefront. As I toured the shop, a neighbor was helping with the cleanup, sweeping broken glass from the floor.\n\nThe early aftermath had been hard to fathom. As the protests went national, they intensified around Minneapolis. Two miles northeast, the 3 rd Precinct police station was set ablaze. The authorities fired tear gas at protesters and journalists. The governor called in the National Guard. The governor and mayor also put a curfew into effect. Within the week, Derek Chauvin, the officer filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck, had been charged with murder.\n\nMourners brought flowers and balloons to place where Floyd died near CUP Foods' doorstep. Organizers brought markers and card stock for protesters to make their own signs. In the week after the killing, many left their signs on the ground or taped to the walls, blending in with the spray-painted graffiti that read \"I Can't Breathe\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" While other areas of Minneapolis saw looting, locals and protesters wanted to preserve the area as a place of protest, especially the space immediately in front of CUP Foods. They established a perimeter around the intersection with barricades and declared it beyond the jurisdiction of the police.\n\nOn June 15, Mahmoud and his brothers tried to open the store back up. That didn't last long. Many protesters who were holding the area down, including residents and activists from Chicago, viewed the reopening as an insult to Floyd's memory and their cause. People who were organizing around the store told the owners it wasn't safe to open-according to Mahmoud, they told the brothers, \"Guys, there's too much animosity. There's too much pressure. It's not safe\"-and they promptly closed back down.\n\nAmong those who warned the brothers to keep the store closed was a group called the Agape Movement, co-founded by a former gang member, who appointed themselves to keep the intersection safe. The name refers to a theological term for Christian love. When I was there, several of them were armed. I spoke with one of the Agape leaders, Steve Floyd, who said he was a distant relative of George's. (\"We're from the same plantation,\" he told me.) Some people-Floyd described them as an angry group separate from the main protesters-\"were ready to bomb that store and burn it up,\" he said. He'd lived in the neighborhood some 40 years, a decade longer than CUP Foods had been there.\n\nSteve Floyd doesn't blame CUP Foods directly for George's killing, but he wouldn't call the store's owners blameless. \"They did what people typically don't do: pointing somebody out for something you don't even get arrested for,\" he said, referring to the neighborhood reluctance to call the police for nonviolent crimes.\n\nAnother local, Carmen Means, who is the executive director of a Minneapolis urban development group, told me that she believed the store should close \"right now, because of the role they played-and to be clear, they did not kill George Floyd, but they did play a meaningful role in the lynching of George Floyd-that speaks to the culture of the store,\" she told me. \"My personal experience inside the store, I didn't have any issues. I won't lie and say that I did,\" she said. \"The challenge,\" she said, \"is what the store represents.\"\n\nEvery time I asked the Abumayyalehs if I could meet the clerk who called 911, they said it wasn't going to happen. He's remained hidden from public view, his identity shielded by the rest of CUP Foods' staff. But on one of my trips to Minneapolis, someone close to the store put us in touch. When we finally talked, he told me I was the first reporter he'd spoken to.\n\nMalik, who agreed to speak if I used a pseudonym, had arrived from West Africa last year to join relatives who were living in Minnesota. Malik is a U.S. citizen but had lived abroad since he was a baby. English is his second language, and even as a tall Black teenager himself, he told me that he wasn't especially aware of the dynamic between Black Americans and the police. When he dialed 911, he said he had no idea what could happen. The transcript of the call shows someone not quite used to calling the police:\n\nOperator: Is he white, Black, Native, Hispanic, Asian?\n\nCaller: Something like that.\n\nOperator: Which one? White, Black, Native, Hispanic, Asian?\n\nCaller: No, he's a Black guy.\n\nOperator: All right. ( sigh )\n\nCaller: How is your day going?\n\nOperator: Not too bad.\n\nCaller: Had a long day, huh?\n\n\"The first week that he died, I was disturbed a lot. I couldn't sleep,\" Malik told me when we met in the city. \"I've been thinking about it every day. Every night. Sleeping, dreaming, sitting, doing nothing.\"\n\nMalik said he had barely interacted with Floyd the night he was killed. \"He just came in, said, 'What's up?' to me, before everything happened. He came to all the employees, was saying 'hi' to everybody,\" he said. \"CUP Foods is usually like that.\"\n\nAfter Floyd paid and left, a clerk passed the bill he used through a machine that identified it as fake. Another teenage employee confronted Floyd outside the store. According to Malik, Floyd refused to return the items he had purchased and cursed them out-\"basically trying to be extra on them,\" as Malik put it. As the other teenager returned to the store, Malik said the employee told him to call 911. So Malik did. \"He [Floyd] is sitting on his car cause he's awfully drunk. He's not in control of himself,\" Malik told the 911 operator.\n\nWhen Mahmoud got the desperate call from his employee, the police were there, and Floyd was pinned down outside. Mahmoud said he told the employee to call the police again. Specifically, he said, \"call the police on the police-and make sure you record it.\" Mahmoud said he had been through this before. He said a police officer used to harass CUP Foods' customers around the store, so he called the cops on the cop. \"It worked,\" he said, and the harassment stopped.\n\nIt wouldn't work this time. A 911 dispatcher who was watching a live feed of the interaction had also reported the officers' actions, to no avail. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes while onlookers pleaded with him to stop. Surveillance video I later reviewed showed one of Nabil's sons, who was at the store, trying to intervene, and the police shoving him away. An hour later, Floyd was pronounced dead. \"I was in shock,\" Mahmoud said.\n\nMalik slid into despair after Floyd's killing. \"I was feeling that I'm done with life, and stuff. Like, why am I even living? I don't deserve to be breathing, stuff like that,\" he said. Malik can't take time off, because he supports himself. \"I have to work because everything I'm doing in life, bills and everything, I have to pay by myself. I have to pay my own rent, take care of myself, and my family,\" he told me.\n\nThings have gotten a bit easier since the early days but not by much: \"I'm still working on it, but at least I sleep now three to four hours a day.\" The killing doesn't just follow him around in his head: \"Sometimes I answer random calls from people I don't know, and they say some bad stuff, like, 'You guys killed George Floyd.' \"\n\nThe Abumayyaleh brothers are worried about Malik, particularly Mahmoud. He's in regular contact with the teen's family and told me he's concerned that he's entered a deep depression.\n\nWhen I talked to Malik, that concern felt warranted. \"At least back home, I know how the stuff works better than the United States,\" he told me. \"Now, if it were up to me, I'd rather live in my mom's country. It's better than the United States. I'm not having any happiness. Only darkness.\"\n\nThe brothers can't help but feel that if only one of them had been there that night, things might have turned out differently. \"We would have just taken the fake money and [banned] him like we do all the time,\" Nabil said. \"That's what we do. Take the fake money and tell them you can't come back in here for two years.\" But the teens manning the store thought they were doing the right thing. \"They got fake money; they called the cops,\" Nabil said. \"It was escalated by a piece-of-shit cop. He had no remorse for human life. None.\"\n\n\"We've kept CUP Foods from burning, that I know of personally, three times,\" Marcia Howard told me the first time we spoke. She's been living exactly 260 steps away from CUP Foods since 1998 and helps maintain the perimeter around the intersection. Howard calls herself the \"community liaison for security.\" She has a roll of other members on her walkie-talkie, and she wears a GoPro on her chest. (\"Pics or it didn't happen,\" she tells me when I ask her why.)\n\nShe's an English teacher at the local high school and has summers off, but she cites her years as a Marine as her primary qualification for this role. \"As the city burned, 38 th and Chicago took care of 38 th and Chicago,\" she told me-she handled breaches and threats of violence to her neighborhood from rioters, some of whom she said were from out of town. (A Black family who lives above the store would have been one unwitting target.)\n\nHoward has an eagle-eyed view of the area. \"I call it the 'five C's of the four corners,' \" she said. \"We've got the community, we've got the churches, we've got CUP, we've got the crooks in the alley, and we've got the cops. And if you want to know the story of 38 th and Chicago Avenue, you have to know those five C's and how they work in concert with and opposition to each other.\"\n\nWith one of her C's, Howard mentioned something I'd heard a lot in the area: that CUP Foods has sometimes been a hangout for people who deal drugs on the corner. Indeed, many protesters who want CUP Foods to stay closed told me they are convinced the neighborhood would be better off without it.\n\nThe brothers don't deny that the intersection sees plenty of criminal activity, but they said that was an issue long before CUP Foods opened up. \"This community right here, where we're at, it's Blood territory,\" Nabil said, referring to the Bloods gang. \"We can't stop that. Let's see the police take that away from them. We're in their neighborhood.\"\n\nCUP Foods' history with the police goes back almost to its opening. According to the brothers, in 1991, just two years after becoming a licensed grocer, the family began making formal complaints to the police about the \"loitering\" problem. They said they were advised to place \"no trespassing\" signs outside their store. In 1993, they said the city conditioned their license renewal on reducing store hours, reporting drug activity to the police, removing signs from their windows that obstruct the view from the outside, and employing off-duty police officers for security.\n\nThe corner got worse . In 1995, the murder rate in Minneapolis peaked. Reports from that year noted that the Bloods gang had taken control of South Minneapolis, and gun battles had become commonplace. (Minneapolis today is safer-the homicide rate in recent years has been less than half what it once was.)\n\nIn 1998, according to court records, the police opened a file on CUP Foods in what it said at the time was a response to complaints about the store. The force surveilled the area and reported it saw people engaging in \"hand-to-hand exchanges\"-possible drug deals-in and around the store. An undercover cop purchased apparent crack cocaine from dealers, in what are known as \"controlled buys,\" inside the shop. But in that investigation, none of the brothers was ever convicted on drug charges. The state charged Nabil with unlawful possession of a firearm, but that charge was later dismissed.\n\nAhmad said that there was a time when Nabil \"got caught up in the street activities himself.\" Nabil told me, \"I was born in the streets. I was a hustler, basically. ... I ran the streets for many years not knowing what I was doing.\" He specifically said he got in trouble for buying and selling electronics that he'd been told were stolen. \"I was buying from this guy who worked for the federal authorities,\" Nabil said. \"He set me up.\" The police got a search warrant based on that investigation, which ultimately led to a conviction for a separate instance of unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\nAfter the 1998 drug investigation, police continued to coordinate controlled buys in the store, and on several occasions, drugs were allegedly purchased from dealers inside CUP Foods. According to an archived city document , in 1999 the Hennepin County Attorney's Office commenced a nuisance-abatement proceeding against CUP Foods, which resulted in the city requiring CUP Foods employees to call the police on all illegal activities, or risk losing their license.\n\n\"We did make a deal with the city because we got many citations for people loitering outside,\" Ahmad said. \"They said that if we don't call them, we get the ticket. So we had to call the police minimum 10 times a week to not get fined. We had a quota.\" (The Minneapolis police said it had \"no knowledge\" of this quota and did not respond to follow-up requests.) \"If we didn't call, we get in trouble,\" he said. \"And if we did call, we get in trouble.\"\n\nThe corner where CUP Foods sits has now been dubbed George Floyd Square. The space outside the shop, where Floyd was killed, has become a sprawling memorial. On the ground where he was pinned by Chauvin, someone painted a silhouette with angel wings. It's now a landmark, with people coming from around the world, some fresh off the plane with suitcases in tow, to see it for themselves. \"Welcome to George Floyd Square,\" volunteers say with a smile, offering up a spritz of hand sanitizer and a mask.\n\nFlowers, trinkets, and signs with handwritten slogans are scattered everywhere, with protest graffiti on every conceivable surface. Tourists take photos with the large raised-fist sculpture at the center of the intersection and with the wooden fist that activists bolted onto the bus stop across the street.\n\nOver the past few months, the brothers have made several attempts to repair their relationship with the community, which are also attempts to save their business. In the immediate aftermath of Floyd's killing, they publicly offered to pay for the funeral and announced that there were going to be significant policy changes on the subject of when employees should call the police (only in cases of violence). Mahmoud told me he has met privately with different members of Floyd's family. He said the meetings included Floyd's children's mother, his brothers, cousin, and uncle. \"The conversation was pleasant,\" he said. \"No animosity at all.\" (I reached out to ask Floyd's family about the meetings and what they think should happen to the store several times through their lawyer but didn't hear back.)\n\nThe brothers also hired Jamar Nelson, a childhood friend, to work as a public relations liaison. (He also does consulting for local political campaigns.) Nelson has had a few ideas about how the store could reopen, including a second mural on the Chicago Avenue-facing façade of a big heart, filled with the names of the many local victims of gun violence in the area who've died before, and after, Floyd. When I met Nelson, he showed me a scar on his head he said came from his own interaction with the police.\n\nNelson told me he believes CUP Foods has been unfairly vilified. \"You can get angry at the Beckys or the Karens of the world because those are malicious, spiteful calls to the police,\" he said. \"This was not that. This is a business that takes extreme caution with calling the police, period. They got raided for not calling the cops. This is a community store,\" he told me.\n\nThe generic Arab store owner has become a cliché in many Black neighborhoods. In my experience, interactions at stores like this tend to be short, and bulletproof glass between clerks and customers creates a barrier both real and psychic. I've heard customers call Arab clerks \"ock,\" an affectionate term short for \"akhi,\" the Arabic word for brother. But Arab clerks are often viewed as racist, or at the very least hostile, toward the Black communities they serve. I have seen the hostility myself, growing up in Newark, New Jersey, a majority-Black city where many corner stores are operated by Arabs.\n\nThat's not what it looks like at CUP-the store has photos of generations of customers on the wall. But I asked Mahmoud if he recognized that dynamic. He knew what I was getting at. \"A lot of Arabs are racist, and it shows. They go in Black communities and open stores, and they don't respect [the community],\" he said. \"But,\" he insisted, \"that's the opposite of us. I have confidence in our community. We're going to open, inshallah. It's just a matter of time.\"\n\nNelson also rejected the idea that this dynamic might have played a part in Floyd's death. \"It's hard for me to say that someone brown is racist, especially immigrants that come from war-torn countries. Because they battle white folks, they know how the white man exerts power. It's a prejudice more than racism, because prejudice comes from ignorance. A brown man who knows what being oppressed means-c'mon, I can't call that person racist.\"\n\nOutside of CUP Foods, Nelson showed me where the brothers were thinking of putting in a permanent rose garden to memorialize Floyd and victims of gun violence. \"I'm fed up because so many people are misinformed,\" he said. \"CUP didn't kill Floyd.\" Nelson wishes that people would focus less on blaming the store and more on \"trying to worry about a kid that is forever traumatized. Because this will never go away.\" The community, he said, is trying to heal. And \"if healing doesn't involve CUP Foods,\" he asserted, \"then that's not real healing.\"\n\nOne Friday in late July, the brothers gathered in the store's basement mosque to talk over an informal offer to buy the store. \"They're trying to strong-arm us,\" Nabil said. \"Let them know this is not a serious offer,\" Mahmoud said.\n\nThey walked and talked, up the stairs and into the store. Their plan had been to wait out the protests, but with the lights off and the door still locked, they knew that was a gamble. On the façade of their building, the words \"FUCK CUP FOODS\" were scribbled. The offers-from where, the brothers didn't say-weren't close to the store's appraised value. But even if they had been, they would have been tough to swallow. Ahmad told me, \"It was never for sale anyways.\"\n\nAfter more than two months mostly dark, CUP Foods finally reopened on Aug. 3 to a very different neighborhood. Protesters tried to force it to close again, barricading the entrance with large trash receptacles. But this time, the Abumayyalehs decided to forge ahead. The business is now bringing in around 70 percent of the revenue it did before Floyd's killing. The streets around the store are still closed off to vehicular traffic, so the people who shop there now only buy what they can easily carry on foot, usually chips, cigarettes, or water.\n\nNot long after the store reopened, I stood outside taking notes. A woman walked past the door and, seeing CUP Foods open for business, exploded with emotion. \"There are people shopping in that store!?\" she exclaimed. \"Ha! That store won't last.\" She kept shouting as she walked down the street. \"This is the motherfucker that should have burned down,\" she said. \"Bitch-ass A-rabs.\"\n\nMinneapolis announced plans to reopen George Floyd Square to street traffic the week of Aug. 17. (The Minneapolis Police say they would not have forcibly removed the barricades.) About 100 people lay down on the street that Monday to show their dissent. The barricades remained.\n\nThe protesters' goal is to have the city agree to what Marcia Howard calls Resolution 001, a list of 24 demands designed to improve the lives of everyone in the neighborhood. (Howard also acts as an unofficial representative of the protesters in the square to the City Council.) They're seeking local government investment in job initiatives, a \"contingency fund\" for small-business owners of color, and work training for the next generation.\n\nHoward said her wishes for the store are tricky. \"They are in this community, and their shoppers are in this community. You cannot protest CUP Foods without protesting the people who patronize them. That's the sticky part,\" she said. \"And so there's work to be done with the people who find it necessary to shop there, and there's work to be done for the family of owners in this neighborhood who monopolize a great deal of businesses. Everybody is trying to be on the right side of history, and that is going to take community building and conversations.\"\n\nToussaint Morrison, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Minneapolis, said he doesn't actually see any problem with CUP Foods reopening. But he doesn't necessarily think anyone should shop there. We met in a local coffee shop a short drive away from George Floyd Square. \"The first Black-owned bookstore just opened. That shows you how far behind Minneapolis is,\" he told me.\n\nMorrison envisioned turning the corner of 38 th and Chicago into a new Black Wall Street, where Black residents can get special business loans so Black Americans can be the ones earning family wealth in their own communities. \"People are ready to ride for 38 th and George Floyd, and people will fight for it,\" he said. \"But the people have to vote with their dollars, and in the Black community, we're not used to that because historically [the ability to do that has] been stripped away from us.\" On CUP Foods reopening, he said, \"I say get a Black-owned corner store near there, and say shop here. We'll beat all of their prices. Even if we lose money, whatever.\" The point, he said, is to keep Black money in the Black community: \"Whether they open or not, it's on us as a community to not buy their shit. It's that simple.\"\n\nAsked about it later, Nabil called that idea ridiculous: \"What's the difference between having a Black corner store and an Arab corner store? If this was a white corner store, I'd say, OK, I see his point. But Arabs, we struggle just like everybody else.\" He added, \"You're asking the only brother that has Black kids. My kids are Black.\" His sons are expected to take over management of the store to keep it within the family. \"By them opening their own store, what do you think my kids are going to do? It makes no sense to me,\" he said.\n\nAcross from CUP Foods one afternoon, I met Tahasha Harpole, a graphic designer selling T-shirts from her local shop with Black Lives Matter slogans printed on them. Harpole doesn't think the Abumayyaleh family has done enough to make things right. She knows them well. Her grandmother's house, where she lives now, is one block away. When she was younger, she recalls that the owners would hang bounced checks on the wall behind the register as a scam deterrent. One of the checks had her last name on it-it was a relative's-so she gave Hamadeh the money for the check, and he took it down from the wall. The next day, she asked him for a job, and he gave her one. \"I was the first girl to work there,\" she told me.\n\n\"Nobody saw this coming,\" said Harpole, who is Black. She said she could attest to the store's relationship with customers but also said it isn't enough. She suggests that the brothers could work with entrepreneurs in their vicinity, sharing space inside the store to open stalls for Black-owned businesses, and maybe even offer managerial roles.\n\nAlthough tension between the protesters and CUP Foods is still evident, Howard recently found reason to go inside-after a white vandal sprayed black paint over a mural on the store memorializing George Floyd. \"We got together to capture Daniel the Defacer,\" she told me. \"I got him on the phone, I said, 'Mike, do y'all have a security camera out there?' He said, 'Yeah I'll see you in the morning.' So I went back into his little security office behind the counter of CUP Foods, and I recorded while he was playing it. That's me and him on the video that just went viral.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/rV6evyve2n\n\nAlthough they have been here for more than 30 years, Howard believes things can never return to normal for the brothers. \"They have been gentrified by history,\" she said. \"This is now, including CUP, a national historic site. How they handle that as a family, and as a corporate entity, is going to either redeem their legacy or further tarnish it. And that is still yet to come.\"\n\nWhen I first met Mahmoud, I asked him if he could ever imagine doing anything else but running CUP Foods. \"Absolutely not,\" he told me. \"Never in a million years.\" But day by day, the idea didn't seem so foreign. Mahmoud recently laughed about the rumors that celebrities like Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder wanted to buy CUP from the family. He told me he's waiting on those offers.\n\nSome have called for the store to become a community center. Mahmoud and his brothers aren't against the idea of turning the space into a permanent memorial for Floyd, but they say that idea doesn't require them to pack up and leave. \"What we want to do is a joint venture, so we're part of the movement, not to just sell it and move on,\" Mahmoud said.\n\nOne of the last days I was there, Mahmoud's 13-year-old son was working a shift in the cellphone repair section. With business a little slow, he was mostly walking back and forth, swinging a keychain, killing time. \"I want to be an architect,\" he told me. I asked him if that means he'd move on from the store. \"No, I can do both. I can work at the store and be an architect. I'd make mad money that way,\" he said.\n\nThe family remains in close touch with Malik. The last time I talked to him, he said his father kicked him out of his house in the months after the 911 call, because of what he described as a \"problem between me and my parents.\" But he sounded slightly more upbeat and said he was managing to support himself. \"Thank God-that God is helping me to not do that bad stuff that I'd regret,\" he told me.\n\nBack at the store recently, one of the customers, Sal, a tall Black man with a voice so quiet it's close to a whisper, was teasing Mahmoud's son, joking that he's gotten taller but not any stronger. He told me he's been coming in since he was a kid. \"I grew up around here,\" he said. \"It's where we can get together, conversate, run into people.\" I asked him what he made of the protesters outside who think the store ought to be replaced with a community center. \"It already is a community center,\" he said.\n\nIn the basement mosque that August weekend, the imam was late, so a worshipper stepped in to give the sermon in his stead. It was focused on George Floyd. \"He was a Black man, but you don't have to be Black to feel like that was you,\" he told the group gathered beneath CUP Foods. \"He was a human being first and no human ever should die the way they killed him. No one. Not Black. Not white. Not Muslim. Not Christian. Not Jewish. Nobody.\" It's \"terrorism,\" the worshipper said-\"what they did to him, and to all of us.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What the George Floyd Protests Have Already Changed\n\nAfter two weeks of largely peaceful protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, it is becoming clearer that the Black Lives Matter movement is upending the way many white Americans view policing in this country.\n\nOn Monday, CNN released a poll showing that 84 percent of respondents-including 88 percent of white respondents-viewed the peaceful protests as justified.* In contrast, 67 percent of respondents overall and 67 percent of white respondents answered the question similarly during a 2016 Black Lives Matter protest. Also on Monday, conservative-leaning polling outlet Rasmussen released numbers showing that \"belief that blacks are treated unfairly by police and that police discrimination is a bigger issue than inner city crime have jumped to new highs.\" As Politico's Tim Alberta noted on Sunday, there has been an enormous jump in the number of poll respondents-and particularly white poll respondents-who believe that black people are more likely to be victims of excessive police force in this country, from 33 percent overall and 26 percent among white respondents in 2014 to 57 percent overall and 49 percent among white Americans in a survey taken last week.\n\n\"In my 35 years of polling, I've never seen opinion shift this fast or deeply,\" wrote conservative pollster Frank Luntz in response to the numbers. \"We are a different country today than just 30 days ago.\"\n\nThe outrage in the streets is not just leading to shifting public opinions. It's also producing tangible results. While the goals of protesters calling for widespread defunding of police departments across the country have obviously not been entirely met, it's worth discussing some of what the protests have already achieved. Here is a brief list of some of the reforms that have resulted directly or in part from the protests.\n\nOne of the principal battle cries of the protesters demands that cities \"defund the police\" or replace their current police forces with more community-oriented services like social workers, educators, and violence intervention programs. After Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey faced a stinging chorus of boos for declining to embrace the abolition movement in his city, the Minneapolis City Council announced Sunday that it had a veto-proof majority in support of dismantling the police department as it currently exists. Commissioner members made clear on Monday that the process of disbanding and replacing the department still needs to be hashed out between the commission and the community in the months ahead. The promise itself, though, is a tremendous win for the protesters in the city where the latest iteration of the movement began after former MPD officer Derek Chauvin was recorded kneeling on George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes until he died.\n\nThe calls for cuts to police budgets have spread to the two largest cities in the country. Last week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged to cut upward of $150 million from the proposed LAPD budget after a violent police crackdown on weekend protests and outrage over remarks by police Chief Michael Moore comparing people in the streets to Floyd's killer.* As recently as Friday, meanwhile, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested he was not in favor of budget cuts to the NYPD. On Sunday, though he announced-without offering specifics-that he would support some cuts to the NYPD's $6 billion budget.\n\nWithin days of Floyd's death, the Minneapolis Public Schools board voted unanimously to end a $1 million contract for school security with the MPD. Like the broader push to cut police department budgets generally, the move to end school contracts with police departments has also gone nationwide . Last week's, the Denver Public Schools Board of Education director announced that his board had the votes to remove Denver police officers from security positions in city schools. Similarly, the Portland Public Schools superintendent announced last week that his city's schools would be \"discontinuing the regular presence of school resource officers.\"\n\nThe protests have also zeroed in on the political power of police unions as one reason police are so rarely held accountable for misconduct. Public officials are now being pressured to renounce campaign contributions from organizations representing police officers, particularly district attorneys who might have the responsibility of prosecuting officers in excessive force cases. In New York, more than a dozen public officials promised to donate contributions from law enforcement-affiliated political groups. In California, Bay Area district attorneys called on the state bar to ban political contributions from law enforcement organizations, and a number of elected officials promised to donate any past contributions from law enforcement. (Notably, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who has received $2.2 million in contributions from law enforcement, said that she opposed any state bar prohibition on such contribution.)\n\nAfter police crackdowns on protesters across the country, multiple district attorneys have actually sought to prosecute police officers caught on tape using excessive force on protesters, while also opting not to press charges against those protesters for alleged curfew and unlawful assembly violations. In Los Angeles, Lacey said on Monday she would not prosecute these cases . In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said on Friday that he would not prosecute those low-level arrests. On the flip side, district attorneys in multiple jurisdictions have pledged to prosecute police officers caught on tape abusing protesters. In Buffalo, New York, two officers were charged with second-degree assault after pushing over a 75-year-old man and leaving him to bleed from his ear in the street. In Philadelphia, one officer was charged with aggravated assault after beating a protester with a baton during a protest last week. In Fairfax County, Virginia, an officer was charged with three counts of assault and battery after using a stun gun on a peaceful black protester, who was saying \"I can't breathe\" in an echo of Floyd's last words. In Atlanta, six officers were charged with aggravated assault, simple battery, and damage of property after breaking into a car and stunning two black college students in the middle of a protest. There are hundreds of more similar cases that need to be investigated from last week, but at least some district attorneys have begun to take action.\n\nThe police officers who took part in the killing of Floyd are facing prosecution for second-degree murder and aiding and abetting murder . The upgraded charges for Derek Chauvin and the charges for three other officers by the Minnesota attorney general only happened after days of protest following Floyd's death and Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman's initial reluctance to prosecute the men and decision to file lesser charges against Chauvin. The delay in holding these officers accountable for their alleged criminal actions was one of the major galvanizing forces for the current movement.\n\nWhile the protests did not explicitly address this goal, they have forced multiple prominent news organizations to undergo consequential public reckonings over coverage of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement as well as general treatment of staff members of color. Most notably, James Bennet, once considered a top candidate to be the next editor of the New York Times, resigned from his position as the Times' editorial page editor after failing to properly vet an editorial by Sen. Tom Cotton that called on the U.S. military to violently confront the public assemblies in cities and towns across the country. Similarly, on Monday, Refinery29 co-founder and editor Christene Barberich stepped down following public criticisms by former employees of color who said that they experienced discrimination on the job. These high-profile resignations were preceded by the ousting of the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who resigned after an uproar over a front-page headline in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that read \"Buildings Matter, Too.\" While the public reckoning over the media's treatment of the protest movement and police brutality has not necessarily been one of the larger public goals of the movement, that reckoning is still one profound consequence of these protests. Even with all that it has accomplished thus far, it's clear that the efforts of these protesters are nowhere near finished.\n\nCorrection, June 8, 2020: This piece originally misstated the percentage of people who responded to a CNN poll saying the recent peaceful protests were justified.

      "text": "The Media Is Finally Addressing Its Police Report Problem\n\nThe original press release from the Minneapolis Police Department about George Floyd's murder was a lie.\n\nBy the police account, the murder was not even an act of killing. Under the title \"Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction,\" the release claimed that Floyd had resisted arrest and then suffered \"medical distress\" after being cuffed. That is a drastically reduced description of what actually occurred when Derek Chauvin murdered Floyd. Nowhere does the release mention that the medical distress was brought on by Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds -as Floyd experienced seizures and cried out for help, in front of multiple eyewitnesses. In video footage of the arrest, Floyd's only visible resistance to the officers is his falling to his knees and saying he's claustrophobic.\n\nThe press release resurfaced following Chauvin's conviction, and it renewed a conversation about how, exactly, news outlets should report information that comes from law enforcement officials when the police have killed or injured a civilian. Historically, journalists have tended to defer to police reports as the default narratives around crime and violence; the police are, after all, consistently there as sources at otherwise confusing and unpredictable scenes, and their accounts have the authority of the government behind them. But Floyd's murder presents another challenge to that long-held standard, especially when the police are active participants in the stories they tell.\n\nAs witnesses' cellphone footage has captured more acts of police violence, and as officers' body cameras have kept contradicting their own accounts of events, news outlets have begun couching their coverage of police reports in more skeptical terms. Again and again, law enforcement officials themselves end up revising or retracting essential parts of their stories of what happened. But the old habit remains a powerful one.\n\nKat Stafford, an investigative reporter for the Associated Press, explained in a Twitter thread it's vital that journalists not act as stenographers for the police but instead investigate their account as thoroughly as we would any civilian's.\n\nJournalists will ask people they interview to produce documents and all sorts of proof to make sure that their stories are solid, right? Fact check and verification, line by line in some cases. Why does that level of skepticism not translate to law enforcement agencies?\n\nHow will this knowledge translate into policy for journalists? I asked a number of major news organizations if they planned to change their newsroom standards or guidelines about how to report on information provided by police officers and departments. CBS News said it has been \"reporting on this issue on and off air.\" A spokesperson for the Associated Press said: \"AP's guidance is to treat police statements, like any source of official information, with due skepticism, and question it closely, speak to all parties involved in a particular situation and do our own due diligence. Police information should be attributed properly and not stated as fact.\" The AP spokesperson also pointed to this story addressing the topic following Floyd's murder.\n\nThe Washington Post said its policy is to \"disclose to readers the sources of information in our stories, to the maximum possible extent. When we find that individuals or institutions have misled the public or The Post, we cover that failing, as our reporting on the death of George Floyd demonstrates.\"\n\n(Slate's own official statement on the subject was: \"We don't have a police-specific policy, but our editorial approach is, and will continue to be, to use discretion, fact-check and properly contextualize and frame information provided by police officers and departments. Statements from law enforcement officials can be important and newsworthy developments in a story, but we believe it is our job as a news organization to verify and hold those officials, and the information they provide, to account, just as we strive to do with every source.\")\n\nIn an interview with Slate, two officials for the Gannett newspaper chain described an ongoing set of coverage reforms that are starting within the company's Atlantic region and are meant to be rolled out companywide-part of what they said was a larger reckoning with how to cover policing and crime. As they talked to the public about the company's journalism, Michael Kilian, Gannett's New York state editor, said, \"it became quickly clear that public safety coverage was the big impediment to trust.\"\n\nThe revised approach includes a policy of not writing about a crime or arrest unless the underlying case would be in the public's interest and would merit continued coverage as it passes through the court system. Gannett also avoids publishing police mug shots except in special circumstances-such as if the person is a prominent figure or poses a significant danger to the public-and emphasizes the need for reporters to speak to other people at the scene and in the surrounding community rather than directly publishing the police narrative.\n\n\"I read the police report from Minneapolis, and it took a leave from reality,\" said Hollis R. Towns, the vice president of local news initiatives at Gannett. \"There were a lot of omissions in that police report and a characterization in that police report that was not reflective of what was actually happening on the ground or what happened when George Floyd was taken into custody.\"\n\n\"For many, many years, we've accepted the gospel from police as [the] true religion, and we haven't pushed back,\" Towns said. \"We've accepted it as it is. And I think what this approach does is to look at that differently. That the police are offering one viewpoint on what may have happened.\"\n\nKilian noted that even referring to police as \"the authorities\" in a news story was being discussed, since it further reinforces a historical lack of scrutiny given to law enforcement.\n\n\"We don't call the mayor 'the authority' or President Biden or anybody else,\" he said. \"It puts us in a position of being almost subservient, or subordinate, to the police information. And that is something that's so built in. If we go back and read police news from a year ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago, we can see that.\"\n\n\"We have to cure ourselves of that and treat them as one more source that we should be skeptical of,\" he added, \"and find what the full story is.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

In the footage, an officer pins Floyd's neck to the ground as Floyd is begging, \"Please, I can't breathe\" - a moment that closely resembles the pleas of Eric Garner , a black man who died from an officer's chokehold in 2014. Another police officer watches the scene unfold as bystanders voice their concerns for Floyd. One person comments that Floyd has a bloody nose while another yells, \"Bro, you've got him down, let him breathe at least, man.\"\n\nToward the end of the video, Floyd turns silent and is motionless as his head remains shoved against the pavement. Shortly after, he was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center, according to the New York Times .\n\n\"They treated him worse than they treat animals,\" Philonise Floyd, George's brother, told the Times . \"They took a life - they deserve life.\"\n\nAlthough the video doesn't capture the moments leading to the arrest, the Minneapolis Police Department said they were responding to a call that a man was trying to use a $20 counterfeit bill, according to the Star Tribune . In a statement , the police department said officers arrived at the scene to find Floyd - who matched the description of the suspect - sitting on a car and appearing to be intoxicated. They added that Floyd physically resisted the police and seemed to be \"suffering medical distress,\" which is why they had called for an ambulance.\n\nThe police's excessive use of force seemingly has no excuse: The department does not permit the technique that was used to pin Floyd's head to the ground, according to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey . Four officers involved in the case were fired by Tuesday afternoon, and the FBI has now opened a civil rights investigation on the incident.\n\nIn response to Floyd's death, hundreds of protesters poured into the streets on Tuesday. As they walked about 2 miles to a Minneapolis police precinct, they held signs such as \"I can't breathe\" and \"Jail killer KKKops,\" according to the Associated Press . Police dressed in riot gear clashed with the protesters and fired tear gas - a stark contrast to the stay-at-home protests in the state last month where police presence was minimal.\n\n\"Being black in America should not be a death sentence,\" Frey told the Star Tribune . \"For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man's neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense.\"\n\nThe black community is far too familiar with the police brutality that led to Floyd's death; there is no shortage of stories about law enforcement killing black people who are often unarmed. Although they make up about 13 percent of the population, black people accounted for 23 percent of the people killed by law enforcement in 2019, according to a Washington Post database .\n\nOver the past seven years, there has been growing attention paid to police brutality, due to several high-profile cases: Trayvon Martin , 17, was unarmed when he was shot in 2013 after being reported as \"suspicious\" for simply visiting his dad's fiancee, who lived in a gated community. In the wake of his death came Black Lives Matter, a movement against the systematic violence and discrimination against the black population.\n\nProtests continued as more black men continued to die at the hands of the police in 2014. Eric Garner - whose case closely resembles that of Floyd - said \"I can't breathe\" 11 times as NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold after a confrontation over untaxed cigarettes. A month later, the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown sparked mass protests in Ferguson. And in November, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was playing with his toy pellet gun when he was shot dead seconds after officer Timothy Loehmann stepped out of his squad car.\n\nEven in the past month, the black community has mourned the death of two people killed by both former and current law enforcement officials. In February, Ahmaud Arbery was chased and killed in Georgia by a former police detective and his son; it wasn't until after a graphic video documenting the shooting went viral this month that the men were arrested. And in March, Breonna Taylor, an EMT in Kentucky, was fatally shot in her own apartment by police officers for an investigation that she wasn't even involved in. Like Arbery, her case didn't gain national recognition until recently.\n\nIn the Floyd case, the officers were promptly fired, which is rare in police-involved shootings. Repercussions were swift partially because of a 2016 \"duty to intervene\" policy , which was implemented about nine months after the shooting of Jamar Clark , an unarmed black man. The rule requires officers to stop their colleagues from excessive use of force if they are present at the scene; failure to do so could lead to serious repercussions.\n\nAnd yet Floyd's death shows how black people are subjected to excessive violence even when such laws exist. The countless deaths of black men and women is a form of \" genocide ,\" according to Benjamin Crump - a civil rights lawyer who has taken on the cases of Martin, Brown, Rice, Arbery, and Taylor and will now represent Floyd's family as well - and the killing of Floyd follows the same pattern of systematic racism.\n\n\"How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?\" Crump wrote in a statement on Floyd's death.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Vox Staff\n\nOn May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned George Floyd , a 46-year-old Black man, by the neck with his knee for nine minutes and 29 seconds after responding to a call that Floyd allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy a pack of cigarettes at a local convenience store.\n\nAfter struggling under Chauvin's weight (and that of two other officers) and yelling that he couldn't breathe, Floyd died. Bystanders, who pleaded with the officers to release their restraint of Floyd, recorded the fatal incident on cellphone video that has been viewed across the world, igniting ongoing global protests for police reform and abolition, the protection of Black lives, and the dismantling of racism and white supremacy.\n\nChauvin was fired from the Minneapolis police force after the deadly encounter and faced three charges in a criminal trial that began on March 29: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, Chauvin was found guilty of all three charges , meaning the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a main cause of Floyd's death when he pressed his knee to Floyd's neck. It's a highly rare verdict in a justice system that has historically favored police.\n\nConstance Grady and Anna North\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice released a detailed report on civil rights abuses by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD).\n\nThe report, which was spurred by the 2020 police murder of George Floyd and released just days before Juneteenth , finds that there is \"reasonable cause\" to believe that the MPD and the City of Minneapolis engaged in a \"pattern or practice of conduct that deprives people of their rights under the Constitution and federal law.\" That includes the use of excessive force and discrimination against Black and Native American people.\n\nGregory Svirnovskiy\n\nFrom 16-year-old Ma'khia Bryant in Columbus to 13-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago to 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, it is clear that the systemic problems with policing are widespread.\n\nAnd the problems don't just include shootings. Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd not with his gun but with his knee - and reportedly had seriously injured one other Black person using similar tactics previously .\n\nSean Collins\n\nBroadly, the reaction to the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for George Floyd's murder was one of relief.\n\n\"There's a saying among Black folks,\" Veela Ammons, a business consultant and coach based outside Chicago, told me. \"It says, 'It's not justice, it's just us.' And so we thought it was going to be that kind of situation again where even though it was so plain to see, we thought, from anybody's perspective that this man committed murder, we didn't think that we would actually get that verdict.\"\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nAfter a year of protests, anguish, and a weekslong trial, former police officer Derek Chauvin has been found guilty of murdering George Floyd .\n\nThe jury found that, by kneeling on Floyd's neck until Floyd died, the disgraced ex-cop committed second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter - although, for reasons explained below, he's likely to only face prison time for the first of these three charges.\n\nJerusalem Demsas\n\nWhile Americans waited Tuesday for the verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd , Fordham Law professor and prominent criminologist John Pfaff tweeted something grim.\n\nHe wondered: Would a conviction, \"however much justice demands it,\" actually be a step forward?\n\nKainaz Amaria and Fabiola Cineas\n\nRelief is perhaps the best word to describe what many people felt when they heard Judge Peter Cahill announce the jury's monumental decision to convict former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murder on Tuesday.\n\nMillions of people viewed the cellphone video of Chauvin pinning George Floyd by the neck with his knee last May. Many Americans had previously seen police bludgeon, brutalize, and kill Black people on video (the police assault of Rodney King made its way to TV in 1991), but the murder of Floyd, amid a pandemic that was already ravaging Black communities, became a breaking point in the long history of police claiming the lives of countless Black Americans.\n\nElla Nilsen\n\nAfter the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, President Joe Biden pleaded with the nation - and Congress - not to look away.\n\n\"This can be a moment of significant change,\" Biden said on Tuesday. \"We can't leave this moment thinking our work is done. We have to look at those 9 minutes and 29 seconds; we have to listen.\"\n\nFabiola Cineas and Sean Collins\n\nThe Derek Chauvin verdict has been nearly a year in the making. Footage of the murder of George Floyd last May has been viewed by millions worldwide, sparking ongoing international protests against police brutality and igniting policy changes to reform and reimagine the role of police. Though the amount of video footage of the killing was unprecedented and the momentum for justice was undeniable, history did not necessarily point to an easy conviction.\n\nThe former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty of all three charges - second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. That's rare in a system where it's uncommon to prosecute police for killing someone, let alone convict them. For example, only seven police officers have been convicted of murder for police shootings since 2005. The law favors police - giving them latitude to use force - plus, Americans, including jurors, tend to trust police officers .\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nClosing arguments in Derek Chauvin's trial for the murder of George Floyd wrapped up Monday, and after the jury was excused to begin deliberations, Judge Peter Cahill had some tough words - for Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA).\n\nWhile attending a protest in Minneapolis on Saturday, the longtime Congress member and chair of the House Committee on Financial Services said she thought Chauvin needed to be convicted of murder and urged protesters to \"get more confrontational.\"\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nOn Thursday, the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering George Floyd, adjourned for the week. Jurors will hear closing arguments and begin deliberating on Monday.\n\nFor more than two weeks, the prosecution, a team of four lawyers, presented 38 witnesses to show that Floyd died as a result of Chauvin's knee. They put on the stand bystanders who cried recalling the moment they saw Floyd die under Chauvin's restraint. They brought in 10 local officers , including the Minneapolis police chief, who said the use of force was unreasonable and against protocol. Medical experts testified that a lack of oxygen due to Chauvin's knee caused Floyd's heart to stop. In sum, the prosecution brought out witness after witness who supported that Chauvin's knee was a significant contributing factor in Floyd's death.\n\nSean Collins\n\nThe police killing of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, following a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, came as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is on trial for the killing of George Floyd, roughly 10 miles away.\n\nWright was shot by 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center police force - and former police union president - Kim Potter. Potter, along with the city's police chief, resigned from the force on Tuesday. And Wednesday, with a state investigation into Wright's death underway, a county official announced Potter will face second-degree manslaughter charges .\n\nSean Collins\n\nIf the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering George Floyd, feels momentous, it's because it is.\n\nIt's been nearly a year in the making, ushered into being by nearly 365 days of activism and anger, and by the millions who chanted Floyd's name while vowing to honor his memory.\n\nZeeshan Aleem\n\nSNL's cold open this week featured a fictitious morning news show in Minnesota in which uncomfortable disagreements between anchors highlighted differences in how white and Black Americans perceive the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd, and the state of racial progress.\n\nAfter an initial series of agreements between the white anchors, played by Kate McKinnon and Alex Moffat, and the Black anchors, played by Ego Nwodim and Kenan Thompson, about how damning the evidence against Chauvin is, they run into trouble.\n\nRachel Ramirez and Fabiola Cineas\n\nOn May 25, 2020, the world witnessed the final moments leading up to George Floyd's death: Police officer Derek Chauvin pinned a handcuffed Floyd to the ground with his knee for more than nine minutes until he became unresponsive. The bystander video of the incident, with Floyd muttering his last words, \"I can't breathe,\" sparked racial justice protests around the globe. Now, nearly a year later, Chauvin is on trial facing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nBut despite what people saw, both virtually and in person last May, at the center of the trial is the question: What ultimately killed Floyd? The prosecution has argued that it was Chauvin's knee, constricting Floyd's neck and airway, that ultimately led to his death. Meanwhile, the defense has argued that it was Floyd's history of drug use and underlying conditions that caused his death.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nRoughly a year after the start of a national reckoning over police violence and racism toward Black Americans, support for reforms remains strong - as does broad trust in police, according to a new poll from Vox and Data for Progress .\n\nThe data comes as the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with murder in the death of George Floyd , has prompted renewed discussions about how policing still needs to change.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nOn Monday, prosecutor Steve Schleicher led a line of questioning that perhaps stands as his team's strongest case against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin so far - not because the witness's testimony was especially riveting but because it was coming from Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo.\n\nThat the department's highest-ranking officer was testifying against a team member immediately set the trial apart. In fact, nine other officers from the Minneapolis Police Department have testified against Chauvin in the past week. While Arradondo, the department's first Black chief, has testified against an officer before (as assistant chief in a highly publicized 2019 case that involved the shooting of an unarmed woman), it's rare for so many officers to take the stand against a onetime colleague.\n\nCarl L. Hart\n\nMy emotions teeter between exasperation and outrage each day I read the trial recap of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd.\n\nI'm not naïve. I know how these killer cop trials go. The defense drags the deceased victim's reputation through the mud - \"he was a big Black man prone to violence\" or \"he was under the influence of a drug\" - to create a smoke screen, to generate empathy for the cop. From Michael Brown to Philando Castile, too many judges and juries have fallen victim to this tired ploy - the \"drug-crazed Negro\" script -when a white police officer kills a Black person.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin wasn't going to be broadcast. Minnesota trials never are. It took a pandemic and a decision by Judge Peter Cahill to change that over the objections of the prosecution. Attorney General Keith Ellison's office argued that televising the hearings live might intimidate the witnesses, making them hesitant to testify. A coalition of news outlets, the defense, and, ultimately, Cahill disagreed .\n\nMembers of the public usually have the right to observe courtroom proceedings. It's typically also safe for a crowd to gather peacefully in a courtroom, or in an overflow room with closed-circuit TVs. But we're not living in normal times, and this is not a normal trial.\n\nSean Collins\n\nFor weeks, the site of the Derek Chauvin trial, where the former police officer faces murder and manslaughter charges for the death of George Floyd, has been fortified.\n\nThe Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis is surrounded by concrete barriers, chain-link fencing, and barbed wire. Nearby buildings have boarded up their storefront windows. Members of the National Guard have been patrolling the area, and Minneapolis's mayor and police chief said the law enforcement presence at the site of Floyd's death - as well as throughout the city - will only increase as the trial continues.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nIt's been more than 300 days since Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned down George Floyd's neck - but time hasn't dampened the mental anguish of seeing a Black man die under the weight of a white man sworn to protect the public.\n\nInstead, Chauvin's criminal trial, which began on March 29 and is expected to continue for weeks, has only heightened the emotional toll of the disturbing event.\n\nGerman Lopez\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, is on trial right now. But Chauvin is a major outlier in a system that very rarely imposes serious criminal charges against cops for an on-duty shooting or killing.\n\nTake shootings, for which Chauvin is not accused of, but for which we have the best data: Since 2005, 139 police officers have been arrested for murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, according to data from Philip Matthew Stinson, a criminal justice expert at Bowling Green State University who has been tracking the data for years. That amounts to fewer than nine prosecutions a year.\n\nRachel Ramirez\n\nThe first week of the murder trial of Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd, has been an emotional one. Witnesses who watched Chauvin pin the 46-year-old Black man by the neck with his knee described the trauma they had to live with afterward. They said they were upset and desperate to save Floyd's life; several testified to calling the police on the police. Four of the witnesses on Tuesday were under 18 at the time of Floyd's death - the youngest is now 9 - and testified with the cameras off, their voices wavering and sobbing as they narrated the nine minutes and 29 seconds they saw Floyd \"fighting to breathe.\"\n\nSome of the most affecting testimonies came from 61-year-old bystander Charles McMillian, who broke down in tears after watching a replay of the body camera video of Floyd calling for his mom during the arrest, and Darnella Frazier, who recorded Floyd's fatal arrest in a video that sparked a rallying cry on the streets.\n\nRachel Ramirez\n\nThe quest to seat the jury in the high-profile murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has reached its end.\n\nIn the last two weeks of the televised jury selection process, viewers got a sense of how the judge, defense attorney, prosecutors, and jury would perform when the trial starts Monday.\n\nRachel Ramirez\n\nThe trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the murder of George Floyd, has been delayed for at least a day. The district court judge is awaiting an appeals decision about adding a third-degree murder charge, on top of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Chauvin was caught on video last May kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis, sparking worldwide protests against police violence.\n\nThe third-degree murder charge , under Minnesota law, means the perpetrator acted in a way that was reckless at the risk of causing death and carries a sentence of no more than 25 years. Prosecutors are arguing for the charge because it is easier to prove than second-degree unintentional felony murder. The pending charge would also provide options for jurors about how to convict, since police killings have historically gone unpunished. Police kill about 1,000 people in the line of duty every year.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe defense hopes to raise doubts about how George Floyd died.\n\nby Rachel Ramirez and Fabiola Cineas\n\nOn May 25, 2020, the world witnessed the final moments leading up to George Floyd's death: Police officer Derek Chauvin pinned a handcuffed Floyd to the ground with his knee for more than nine minutes until he became unresponsive. The bystander video of the incident, with Floyd muttering his last words, \"I can't breathe,\" sparked racial justice protests around the globe. Now, nearly a year later, Chauvin is on trial facing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nBut despite what people saw, both virtually and in person last May, at the center of the trial is the question: What ultimately killed Floyd? The prosecution has argued that it was Chauvin's knee, constricting Floyd's neck and airway, that ultimately led to his death. Meanwhile, the defense has argued that it was Floyd's history of drug use and underlying conditions that caused his death.\n\nTwo autopsy reports - one by a private medical examiner commissioned by Floyd's family and another by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner - reached the same conclusion: that Floyd died of homicide, meaning death at the hands of someone else. But the medical examiner report also highlighted that Floyd suffered from other \"significant conditions,\" such as fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. These latter conditions are what the defense is using to argue that Chauvin is not responsible for Floyd's death.\n\nOn Friday, Hennepin County chief medical examiner Andrew Baker, who performed the county autopsy, took the stand. In documents last year, Baker described the \" fatal level of fentanyl \" in Floyd's system and told federal investigators that if the victim was \"found dead at home alone and no other apparent causes, this could be an acceptable overdose.\" Baker also cautioned, \"I am not saying this killed him.\"\n\nDuring cross examination, Baker clarified further. When the defense asked Baker whether fentanyl could have caused the abrasions on Floyd's lung that were revealed during the autopsy, Baker said that underlying health conditions were \"contributing\" and not \"direct causes\" of Floyd's death.\n\n\"In my opinion, the law enforcement, subdual restraint, and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions,\" Baker said.\n\nFloyd's history of drug use is expected to be the most contentious part of the trial. So far, the prosecution had Floyd's girlfriend take the stand to preemptively humanize his addiction. \"Our story is a classic story of how many people get addicted to opioids,\" Courtney Ross said during her testimony. \"We both had prescriptions but ... we got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times.\"\n\nThe prosecution also brought in witnesses, such as the paramedics and the doctor who treated Floyd as well as a police surgeon and national breathing expert, who have said Floyd died due to a lack of oxygen. Even Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, the city's first Black chief, testified that Chauvin pinned Floyd for too long and that restraints should have stopped \"once Mr. Floyd stopped resisting.\"\n\nTo get a conviction, prosecutors don't have to prove that Chauvin's actions were the sole cause of Floyd's death, according to the state's jury instruction guidelines . \"The fact that other causes contribute to the death does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability,\" the guidelines note. By emphasizing Floyd's drug use, the defense is just trying to muddy the waters, john powell, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and civil rights scholar, told Vox.\n\n\"The prosecutors shouldn't have to make the case that Floyd didn't have drugs in his body or that drugs were a contributing factor,\" powell said. \"All they have to do is make the case that Chauvin's knee on the neck for nine minutes and 20 seconds substantially contributed to Floyd's death.\"\n\nDespite similar conclusions ruling Floyd's death a homicide, there is a key difference in accounts of what caused it. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office states that the cause of death was a \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\" - which means physical restraint (handcuffs and Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck) was a significant factor in Floyd's cardiac arrest. But the private autopsy report found the cause was actually \"mechanical asphyxia\" that made Floyd's heart stop, implying that there were no underlying conditions that may have played a role.\n\nIn their opening statement, prosecutors said they would make the case that Floyd died of asphyxia, or insufficient oxygen, which was not mentioned in the county report. On Monday, the prosecution brought to the stand Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld, a senior resident at the Hennepin County Medical Center who worked to recover Floyd but eventually pronounced him dead. Langenfeld said that based on the information he had, asphyxia was \"more likely than other possibilities\" to have caused Floyd's cardiac arrest. But under cross-examination by the defense, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson stuck with questioning Floyd's use of drugs and asked if high levels of fentanyl and methamphetamine could also cause insufficient oxygen. The doctor agreed.\n\nMartin J. Tobin, a pulmonologist and breathing expert, offered perhaps the most striking medical testimony in the prosecution's case. On Thursday, Tobin took the stand and provided a detailed account of how Floyd died - including that Chauvin had placed more than 90 pounds on Floyd's neck and that 85 percent of Floyd's airways were restricted. Ultimately, Tobin said, Floyd died from \"a low level of oxygen\" caused by police restraint. \"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,\" he said.\n\nTobin pushed back against Nelson's questioning about Floyd's drug use, saying he saw no evidence of an overdose in the footage, as Floyd seemed to be breathing fine before police restrained him. Seven medical experts who spoke to the Washington Post last month also warned against calling the situation an overdose, arguing that Floyd wouldn't have had the same energy or behavior interacting with the police as he did if he were on his way to an overdose.\n\nIn his testimony Friday, Baker clarified why he ruled Floyd's death a homicide. According to Baker, Floyd had severe underlying heart disease and hypertensive heart disease, meaning his heart weighed more than it should. But these conditions didn't cause Floyd's death. What caused Floyd's death were conditions created by Chauvin and other officers that caused Floyd's heart to work harder to provide oxygen during the encounter. He also explained the language he used on Floyd's death certificate - \"complicating\" means \"in the setting of.\" In other words, Floyd's heart stopped because of Chauvin's neck restraint.\n\nSo far, the defense's argument has relied largely on Floyd's history of drug use and the result of the Hennepin County toxicology report. But Baker's testimony - that drugs were \"not a direct cause\" - has hindered this argument.\n\nThe defense's strategy of focusing on Floyd's drug use has drawn parallels to a long history of painting Black men killed by police as criminals and drug addicts . \"Part of the [defense's] argument is really just saying Floyd is not worthy of our concern and respect, and you saw this on Fox News like 'why are people so upset this guy has a criminal record, he was on drugs, he was trying to pass off a fake dollar bill, he's not a hero,'\" powell said. \"It's like immediately Floyd became on trial. It's not the police on trial; it's the person who has been killed who is on trial. It's Michael Brown. It's Eric Garner. ... It's Rodney King.\"\n\nWhile the prosecution has called a handful of medical experts to the stand so far, the defense has 15 medical experts queued up as potential witnesses when it presents its case next week - though it is unknown how many will testify. Multiple medical testimonies, notes powell, may confuse and overwhelm the jury.\n\n\"The defense has to prove that there's reasonable or some doubt,\" powell said. \"Sometimes, what lawyers do is that if you have good facts, you try to confuse people, so any contradiction or anything to make the jury question like, 'When you look at all these things are you sure this is what caused his death?'\"\n\nThe trial's outcome may hinge on whether the prosecution has built a strong enough case with medical and police testimony to erase doubt that Chauvin played \"a substantial causal factor in causing\" Floyd's death.

      "text": "The power of televising Derek Chauvin's trial\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe saw George Floyd die onscreen. We need to see this too.\n\nby Alissa Wilkinson\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin wasn't going to be broadcast. Minnesota trials never are. It took a pandemic and a decision by Judge Peter Cahill to change that over the objections of the prosecution. Attorney General Keith Ellison's office argued that televising the hearings live might intimidate the witnesses, making them hesitant to testify. A coalition of news outlets, the defense, and, ultimately, Cahill disagreed .\n\nMembers of the public usually have the right to observe courtroom proceedings. It's typically also safe for a crowd to gather peacefully in a courtroom, or in an overflow room with closed-circuit TVs. But we're not living in normal times, and this is not a normal trial.\n\nIn requesting the change to the Minnesota court system's standard procedures, news outlets argued that \"given the enormous public interest in this trial, the limitations imposed by the pandemic, and the options created by modern technology, meaningful access equates to remote access.\" Essentially, they said Chauvin's trial is not just about what happened in Minnesota. It's about what is happening across America.\n\nChauvin, a former officer in the Minnesota Police Department, is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd.\n\nFloyd's death ignited months of protests and unrest across the country and around the world, and for some, it marked the first time they were moved to take to the streets . The footage that emerged was damning. It was devastating. And it evoked an emotional response in a way that news reports, no matter how hard-hitting or well-edited, sometimes can't: Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds . We know because we saw it happen. We saw the video.\n\nOr did we? The footage we saw showed Chauvin pinning down Floyd for eight minutes, 46 seconds. That precise span of time, established by a widely circulated video a bystander shot with their phone, has become such a symbol - of the horrors of police brutality in general and of Floyd's death in particular - that it has its own Wikipedia page filled with examples of politicians, corporations, activists, and entire cities using the number to commemorate Floyd and raise the alarm.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange paused trading for eight minutes, 46 seconds. Google held an eight minute and 46 second \"moment\" of silence for its employees. Music streaming services paused special programming . Legislators took a knee.\n\nLong stretches of silence are uncomfortable; they spur people into a contemplative state. And while eight minutes and 46 seconds can be a short time, it's an eternity if you're staring mortality and brutality in the face.\n\nBut it turns out Chauvin forcibly restrained Floyd even longer than most people thought. Prosecutors revealed the full extent of their encounter during the first week of the trial - nine minutes and 29 seconds of Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck - and the revelation was shocking . Reality was worse than the footage.\n\nIt is a succinct embodiment of this moment in history that a number drawn from a video - shot on a phone, uploaded to the internet, and seen all over the world by viewers frozen in place by a virus - became such a profound symbol.\n\nBefore Cahill's decision allowed TV cameras into the courtroom for Chauvin's trial, the situation was already mediated to us through phone cameras and Twitter, through videos of protests and unrest, each one putting a frame around Floyd's death and the events that followed, each one with a narrative in mind. Every video told a particular part of a story - some spotlighting the size and passion of peaceful crowds, others zooming in on property damage - and as the protests raged on, sometimes those stories conflicted.\n\nBut sometimes the stories harmonized. As other video emerged (from nearby security cameras, for instance), journalists worked to widen the frame, to fill in the picture of what happened to Floyd. New angles and voices entered the story; the meaning of the events on May 25 became clearer. We can now witness bystanders screaming, hear what they said, understand their helplessness, and see more clearly how Floyd was treated at the hands of police.\n\nThe result is that, while almost none of us were there, it may feel as though we were. That's not new. We have seen videos of police brutality before, as far back as the beating of Rodney King in 1991. With time and technological advances, such videos have picked up force and clarity. Reading about beatings and brutality is one thing - seeing them happen is something entirely different.\n\nSmartphones have turned citizens into reluctant documentarians. Major catastrophic or violent events are increasingly caught on camera. There's almost always one snapping nearby, on someone's phone or within a surveillance system, and from there it's just one click to virality. Floyd's death was recorded, but so are those of many others , and they have been for a long time. We're all everywhere now, seeing everything. And what we're seeing adds to an increased awareness of systemic racism and injustice.\n\nSo it's a little jarring what we don't see while watching news footage of Chauvin's trial. In his ruling that the trial should be televised, Cahill gave strict instructions: Floyd's family and any witnesses who are minors could not be filmed without their consent. The cameras are not permitted to zoom in on the tables where counsel is seated, meaning no one can shoot close-ups of Chauvin or either set of attorneys. No cameraperson can create meaning by capturing reaction shots during testimony, the way you would in a cinematic courtroom drama.\n\nCahill's rules seem designed to not only protect people in the room but also to buck the genre conventions of courtroom shows and movies. This is not fiction. This is not an action movie or a drama about characters based vaguely on real-life figures. It is not a political battle, and it is not a triumphant story of a scrappy lawyer taking on the establishment. It's actually happening. Real lives remain at stake; actual justice is in process. Few people are in the room, but we should act like we are.\n\nThere's one more rule: Jurors must be kept off camera completely. This is so important that Cahill ordered a plexiglass partition removed during jury selection because a potential juror's face was partially reflected in it.\n\nIn doing so, Cahill was nodding to the same sentiment the prosecutors expressed in their case against a televised trial: that broadcasting the proceedings to the whole world would not just give access to the public, it would also encourage the kind of harassment that virtually anyone whose face appears on the internet can experience. In a highly politicized and volatile case such as this one - even with the rise in support for Black Lives Matter and a distrust of police that happened in the wake of Floyd's death - that's a real, frightening possibility.\n\nHaving to balance those objectives - transparency in courtroom proceedings and privacy for those who participate - reflects with crystal clarity the quandary both journalists and the justice system face today. When we've all seen the footage and feel like we were there, how do you select an impartial jury ? And when the audience isn't limited to those in the room but expands to include everyone watching the live broadcast - when the whole world can tune in - does that affect the outcome?\n\nHigh-profile trials have been televised for decades, and many have drawn considerable public interest. Chauvin's is hardly the first to become a broadcast event. And yet it feels different. Some of that feeling is due to the inextricable link between the public interest in this case and smartphones and the internet.\n\nAnd some may be due to audio of the eyewitnesses' testimony and the footage emerging from the courtroom. There's power to those images that isn't captured in text. We have a new framework for listening to these eyewitnesses tell the story, one that has moved away from seeing victims as criminals receiving their just deserts and toward focusing on the injustice of the system around them. This trial proves something simple: No matter how viral a video of police brutality becomes, its power and pain are not diminished.\n\nThe most striking images in the first days of the trial came from witnesses who testified and sobbed in court, testifying to feeling guilty that they couldn't do more to stop the police who held Floyd down. Watching video footage of the arrest and listening as Floyd cried out for his mother in his last moments of life, bystander Charles McMillian broke down in tears on the witness stand.\n\n\"I feel helpless,\" McMillian told the court, explaining why he was crying. \"I don't have a mama either. I understand him.\"\n\nThe jury watched the footage, and several were similarly moved. On March 31, the proceedings were halted when one member of the jury, a white woman in her 50s, stood up and left. She felt ill - or had a \"stress-related reaction,\" as Cahill put it - and later returned.\n\nWhile it all happened (or hours or days later, on YouTube), we watched. We, the public, could watch the jury watch the videos and break down. Just as we did last summer, we have the opportunity to form opinions about what we're seeing, based on images and framed by our TVs, phones, and laptops. The televised trial gives us another chance to participate, to fill in our mental pictures of what happened. To decide that we're part of this story, too.\n\nChauvin's trial is airing on TV, but it isn't acting like television. It has no intentional entertainment value. This isn't the trial of O.J. Simpson or Casey Anthony. At every turn so far, Chauvin's time in court has reminded us as viewers of our involvement, or at least our feelings of involvement, in Floyd's death.\n\nMore broadly, every day of the trial reinforces what some always knew and what some only started to learn last summer: There is something deeply wrong when someone dies like this, and it's impossible to divorce emotion from logic when evaluating someone's life. That the only reason a lot of people know about George Floyd at all - the only reason anyone's watching Derek Chauvin's trial in the first place - is that we've turned into a nation of documentarians, stitching together a narrative that's much bigger than ourselves.\n\nFloyd's death represented one breaking point, evidence for some who had turned away before that something was deeply wrong. But for the American public, the weeping witnesses and gut-churning testimony should be further evidence - in a way that no newspaper article or evening news segment could capture - that the story won't end when the trial is over.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

The uprisings drew a high number of students and young people into the streets; one recent poll from Michigan Medicine at the University of Michigan claims that 2020 saw a particularly high number of teenagers protesting , with one in 12 parents reporting their teen attended a protest last year.\n\nThe summer was a radicalizing moment for many, and had a particular impact on young people: According to a June 2020 Gallup poll , 81 percent of survey participants between the ages of 18 and 34 believe that policing in America must undergo \"major changes,\" as opposed to 43 percent of survey participants ages 50 to 64; 33 percent of young people surveyed want to abolish the police altogether.\n\nLast month, Derek Chauvin, the then-Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd, was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 75 years of jail time. Though many - including first-time activists from last summer - were relieved that Chauvin faced consequences for the murder, others have also pointed out that removing one \"bad apple\" from the police force does little to enact real change to the institution of policing.\n\n\"My position toward abolition increases daily,\" said Dorien Perry-Tillmon, a 20-year old student at Loyola University and organizer during last summer's protests in Chicago. \"However, I have become extremely pessimistic. I have no faith that this country can grow past its police state era.\"\n\nBut attendees of last summer's protests told Vox that the events sparked change for them. In the year since Floyd's death, many young first-time protesters have become veteran organizers: coordinating more protests against the police, reading up on political issues that are important to them, and deepening their politics through study and activism.\n\nMany spoke not only of feeling more informed and aware of the social issues that surround them, but of a sense of skepticism about the possibility of real change in the future under our current political and economic systems. Vox spoke to four young activists about the lasting impact of last summer's protests. Their remarks have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nMaya Green, 19, Stanford University student\n\nThis summer, I attended protests for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in various parts of the Charleston area whenever they were advertised on Instagram - I felt pretty helpless and so, so angry, so showing solidarity in that way was cathartic and much needed, even as I also felt anxious about Covid.\n\nI remember at one protest that I attended this summer, someone started playing Kendrick Lamar and people started dancing. It was one of those surreal moments of joy that sometimes happen at protests.\n\nThe police had been watching us the whole day, and when the dancing started one of them joined in. I remember thinking it was super weird that the police would be celebrating at a protest against them and just being really uncomfortable by it. It definitely felt like co-option of a moment that did not belong to him. Later, when I was walking back to my car, I saw that right across the street from where that one police officer was dancing were over a dozen officers in full tear gas gear with batons, ready to disperse the crowd the second curfew hit. It was so disingenuous.\n\nAs I watched protests across the country be met with such violence and vitriol night after night, it just became really clear to me that the solution can't be an additional training session or the occasional firing of someone caught on camera. It has to be something radically different.\n\nI just felt so incredibly angry last summer. I'd been watching Black people die my whole life, and it was always followed by calls for reform, and yet the death just kept happening over and over again. It was so heavy and I was just so tired of it, and so on a personal level, learning about abolition felt really cathartic.\n\nI learned this summer that it's really easy to get burned out and become disillusioned, so I'm trying to rest when I need it and be intentional about taking the time to learn. And I'm looking to the activists, so many of them Black women, who have been doing this work for years.\n\nWhere do we go next? I think defunding the police is the bare minimum, and abolition is the goal. But I know in my city, it's not even an accepted given that racism exists in policing, which is a really frustrating place to be in. In that sense, I think there's absolutely value in the organizing that activists are doing here for racial bias audits, as long as the results aren't used to justify more funding ... which is too often the case.\n\nKashish Bastola, 16, high school student and organizer in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area\n\nI was heavily involved in organizing during the summer of 2020, mostly organizing against overpolicing in schools and gun violence on campus. On May 30, 2020, a few friends and I started organizing a rapid-response rally in McKinney, Texas. The next day, on May 31, 2020, hundreds of youth across the North Texas area joined in solidarity as we demanded an end to the egregious injustices that took place in our own community.\n\nAs I shouted for justice with my three masks protecting me, I felt united with my community. Overpoliced communities face higher rates of police violence and acknowledging that this is a systemic issue forces the movement to challenge the status quo. I continued organizing well into the school year, calling for police budget divestments and community investments. After reading so much about the school-to-prison pipeline over the summer, I also became heavily involved in the movement for education justice.\n\nThe summer of 2020 was most definitely a learning curve. I was learning of events, figures, and movements intentionally left out of my textbooks. As I learned more, I felt more empowered to take action. I started thinking more about what collective liberation means for our society. This past summer showed me that the fight for human rights and liberation does not fit within political party lines in the United States. All of the conversations about public safety have also led me to see that our communities, if given the proper resources, can uphold justice and peace.\n\nZigi Kaiser, 18, high school student and front-line worker in Minneapolis\n\nIt was like watching some horror movie when I watched the livestreams of the riots and protesting, and couldn't believe things were burning just a mile from me and a couple blocks from my school. None of it felt real. I work on Lake Street, where all of the rioting was happening, and watching the community and businesses get rebuilt in the last year is bittersweet. It's kind of like the community healing.\n\nLast summer, I helped organize and lead the Youth Coalition for Alternative Safety to find alternative safety officers once the Minneapolis Public Schools and Minneapolis Police contract was terminated. I and others in the coalition met with safety and youth organizations, and I co-created a petition to remove police before the contract was terminated.\n\nThe summer of 2020 deepened my understanding of the Black Lives Matter movement. I felt that before George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement wasn't super prevalent in my communities, like at school, even though there were many Black people murdered at the hands of police before George. I think a lot of us at my high school didn't feel super involved with the current happenings of BLM, but we learned about the movement in debate and sometimes in class.\n\nAfter George Floyd and after protesting last summer, I felt that something revolutionary had happened in Minneapolis, and although I was always in support, this time I had a much better understanding of why people rioted and looted, and I felt supportive of that, too.\n\nDorien Perry-Tillmon, 20, student at Loyola University in Chicago\n\nWhen I moved to Chicago last summer, I founded Our Streets LUC where we protested through the streets of Rogers Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, calling for our school to defund and cut ties with the Chicago Police Department, as well as demonstrate support for Black students, faculty, and staff. Me and the other youth activists I work with have been trying to keep momentum, especially after President Biden's election, to remind folks that there has been little to no progress in our country since Floyd's death.\n\nThe summer of 2020 didn't necessarily change my politics; it organized them. Growing up, I always believed basic things like equal rights, and food and housing security, and climate change, but didn't feel represented enough by the Democratic Party, although I was brought up to believe they were the good guys. The summer of 2020 taught me that many people felt the same way. I definitely think that the culture of the last year has allowed these conversations to flow more naturally and happen more consistently.\n\nMy position toward abolition [of police] increases daily; however, I have become extremely pessimistic. With the amount of Black and brown people dying at the hands of police, I have no faith that this country can grow past its police state era. While I hope that one day our communities can flourish without fear of police or imperialist politicians, with uplifted communities, mutual aid, and a simple regard for all human life, I fear that I will not live long enough to see that day, if it ever comes.

      "text": "These 3 cities began boldly reimagining policing after George Floyd's murder\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nProgress in each has been fitful and difficult. But that hasn't blunted resolve to truly change policing.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nA year after George Floyd's murder and the worldwide protests it sparked, more than half of US states have passed reform bills , altering policies like use of force, creating new rules about tracking misconduct, and mandating officer interventions during aggressive encounters. Major cities even made moves to aggressively reimagine policing.\n\nSome of these changes have been tentative; some have been reversed; others have run up against lawsuits and backlash and red tape; some have been far less than what local protesters have called for. Changing policing, it has become apparent, will not be instantaneous or easy.\n\n\"I tell people, this is long, hard work,\" said Jo Ann Hardesty, the city commissioner of Portland, Oregon, and a longtime activist.\n\nAlthough the protests are no longer as large as they were last summer, the will to continue that work seems to still be present: An Associated Press/NORC poll conducted April 29 to May 3 found that 45 percent of Americans see police violence against the public as a serious problem. While that number is down 3 percentage points from the height of 2020's protests, it is up 13 points from July 2015. The same poll found that 95 percent of Americans believe the criminal justice system needs to be changed, with 68 percent saying the system needs a complete or major overhaul.\n\nAs cities have begun enacting these sorts of major reforms, they have broadly fallen into three categories: reallocation of police funds into social services and community programs; citizen-based oversight initiatives; and plans to rethink how police departments look and function. Vox looked at three cities' journeys toward making radical changes to how policing is done.\n\n\"We have to stop being afraid of going against the grain and do something new,\" Austin Justice Coalition founder and executive director Chas Moore told me. And now, one year after Floyd's death, some cities are trying to do just that.\n\nMore than 20 of the US's largest cities voted to reduce their police budgets in 2021. Seattle cut about $70 million from its police budget, and has pledged to allow citizens to decide how some of that reduction will be spent ; New York eliminated about $500 million (though it may increase the department's budget for 2022 ); and San Francisco has pledged to reallocate $120 million in the next two years.\n\nThe city that has committed to making the largest cut, as Fola Akinnibi, Sarah Holder, and Christopher Cannon note for Bloomberg , is Austin: In August 2020, the city council there agreed to remove $153.2 million from the Austin Police Department's 2021 budget - a reduction of about one-third.\n\nAt the moment, about $108.1 million of that money has been allocated to two tranches. One is a $31.5 million fund focused on distributing money to organizations and programs aimed at decreasing the need for police - for instance, Cate Graziani of Texas Harm Reduction Alliance, an organization that supports those working with substance abuse, said her group recently received money from this fund. The other $76.6 million fund covers civilian oversight of police, and helps make certain agencies independent of the police.\n\n\"Now we have an independent forensics lab, we now have a stand-alone 911 call center that isn't run by the police department,\" Austin council member Gregorio Casar told me. \"Just yesterday, we voted to double our family violence shelter capacity in Austin using the reinvestments from the police budget. Over the course of the last few weeks and months, we've purchased housing for folks experiencing homelessness. We've hired mental health first responders, so now if you call 911 in Austin, you hear, 'Do you need fire, police, EMS, or mental health?'\"\n\nThese are significant changes - there is hope, for instance, that making the forensics lab independent will help it avoid further backlogs in rape kits , and activists have been calling for years for more mental health and homeless services.\n\nBut some Austin activists have questioned whether they go far enough, and whether they can appropriately address the scale of the city's issues. On the matter of homelessness, for instance, Grassroots Leadership's criminal justice organizer David Johnson pointed out that \"the city has voted to further criminalize homelessness again,\" after city residents voted to ban public camping , and Graziani noted that many of the homeless Austin residents she works with have not had positive experiences with the homelessness services on offer. A significant amount of the money set aside for reallocation also has not yet been spent.\n\n\"The headlines would make it seem as if we're one of the model cities when it comes to defunding the police,\" Graziani said. \"It's a lot of headlines, without a lot of substance.\"\n\nGraziani, Johnson, dozens of other activists, and several city representatives worked as part of a city-backed group called the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force to provide the substance Graziani says is lacking, researching ways to spend the third and final tranche of money Austin promised to reinvest from its police budget: $45.1 million.\n\nLed by Communities of Color United's Paula X. Rojas and the Austin Equity Office's Brion Oaks, these activists put together a report that gives recommendations on how to address the problems caused by poor and violent policing across eight areas, including providing more services to those affected by violence; making significant changes to police training, staffing levels, and patrol practices; and expanding community engagement.\n\nThe task force recently presented its recommendations to the city council, and is working with representatives from the city to conduct an analysis of the feasibility, financial effects, and legal basis of the recommendations.\n\nCasar told me that, the analysis aside, he plans to introduce a resolution in June that would codify some of the group's recommendations into city ordinance: making new housing, mental health, and violence prevention investments - as well as modifying city policy on certain traffic offenses, including nonmoving violations.\n\nBeyond the analysis and resolution, it's unclear what's next: \"At this point in time, we as a task force are partially waiting - we want to see what the city is going to do next with this,\" Johnson said. \"However, we can't afford to sit back and wait, because the community that empowers us empowers us to do this work whether or not the city goes along with us.\"\n\nAlso ongoing is the work to provide greater oversight of local police forces through police accountability boards - it's a task activists have been hard at work on for nearly a century.\n\nIn theory, these committees, which are often staffed by community members with no ties to law enforcement, can improve the quality of local policing through inquiries into misconduct, by issuing policy recommendations, and by conducting reviews of departments' internal investigations.\n\nIn practice, however, boards have historically run up against limitations that infringe on their ability to effect meaningful change.\n\nUniversity of Chicago law professor Sharon R. Fairley outlined the most common of these limitations in a 2020 study . Some issues include the fact that in many localities, boards are required to be advised by the city's legal counsel - the same lawyers who are defending cities and their departments against misconduct lawsuits. And many boards lack subpoena power, forced instead to do their work using whatever testimony and documents departments agree to provide, if any, and police unions can stop or weaken oversight through lawsuits and contract negotiations.\n\nThese are just some of the limitations that have led to committees with relatively narrow abilities, like those in Nashville , Chicago , and New York , that can recommend discipline following accusations of misconduct but that cannot mete out that discipline; or boards like those in Tampa , Baltimore , and Buffalo , which can suggest policy but cannot institute it themselves.\n\nPortland is trying to take a different approach. In November 2020, 82 percent of the city's voters approved the ballot initiative Measure 26-217 , which changed the city's charter to create a new community police oversight board that, once set up, will be the country's most powerful.\n\n\"The system we have now, they call it independent police review, but it's not independent, it doesn't really review the police,\" Hardesty said. \"It is a system not built on accountability.\"\n\nAt the moment, Portland's Citizen Review Committee has the ability to receive complaints about policing, advise the city's oversight agency, and field appeals from citizens and officers on complaints and investigations. The new board will have powers beyond this: It will be able to investigate police misconduct - and, to complete its work, will be able to subpoena documents and compel the release of evidence, witness testimony, and the cooperation of sworn officers. Rather than recommend discipline, the board will impose it itself - it will even be able to fire officers, including those found to have lied when presenting evidence or testimony during the course of the inquiry.\n\nAnd the new board will have the ability to make policy; should the department reject a rule created by the board, that rule will automatically be sent to the city council for a vote, and the council could vote to institute it.\n\nTo ensure board members have the resources needed to do their work, the measure tied its funding to the police department's budget: The board must be given at least 5 percent of the police department's budget each year - far more than the 0.5 percent and 1 percent of local police budgets boards in Albuquerque and Chicago receive, respectively.\n\n\"Creating a truly independent police oversight board is something this community's been asking for for decades,\" Hardesty said. \"That has always been the No. 1 thing, because what the community knows is that as long as police police police, there will never be accountability in the system.\"\n\nDarren Golden, a political consultant in Oregon, said the board should be up and running in about 18 months, although it has already hit a snag: Despite passing with overwhelming support, the police union has worked to stop the charter change from going into effect.\n\n\"This is a drastic change, which is why the Police Association was against it,\" Golden said. \"The issue that arose was the board has to be reflected in the contract between the city and the Police Association. And since that discipline is attached, it's a mandatory bargaining item.\"\n\nThe next step would ordinarily be for an independent arbitrator to help the city and the union reconcile police contracts; however, Golden said, that arbitrator is bound by precedent - and with this change being unprecedented, there was some concern that arbitration would result in November's vote being overturned.\n\nInstead, the city found what it believes will be a workaround: an amendment to Oregon's Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act . That amendment, SB 621 , Golden said, states that an \"independent community police oversight board can be implemented into a contract without mandatory disciplinary bargaining, if the board was voted on and passed by a majority of the people in that area, and if it was done after July 1, 2020.\"\n\nThe charter change meets both those requirements, and seems poised to go into effect - SB 621 has made it through the state's Senate and House Judiciary Committees, and advocates for the amendment believe, given current vote counts, that it will become law.\n\nAnd should that happen, the city will begin the process of standing up the board. Hardesty said she and Portland's other commissioners have already received more than 100 applications from citizens who want to be part of the 20-member group that will decide the specifics of how the board will operate.\n\nOnce it begins its work, it is unlikely to completely solve all of Portland's problems with policing - but its proponents believe it will create real improvements, particularly given the breadth with which it has been given to operate. Still, Hardesty said its success, and the success of future efforts to better policing, will depend on the community's continued involvement.\n\nThe new oversight board itself is the product of this approach, Hardesty said: \"This is work that has been deeply desired by the community for the whole 30-plus years I've been working on this issue. I like to tell people, you know, 30 years of work for overnight success.\"\n\nA few cities have begun to contemplate whether reforms like oversight and defunding go far enough - and whether their police departments ought to be completely rethought instead.\n\nBrooklyn Center, Minnesota - the Minneapolis suburb where 20-year-old Daunte Wright was killed during a traffic stop in April - recently voted to do just this , authorizing the creation of a new Community Response Department tasked with answering all calls for help related to a \"medical, mental health, disability-related, or other behavioral or social need,\" as well as a civilian-staffed traffic enforcement department that will handle all nonmoving violations. It also ordered the police department to work with these departments under the umbrella of a new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention that has to be led by someone with \"public health expertise.\"\n\nIn April, Ithaca, New York , resolved to similarly reorganize its police department, and to create a civilian-led Department of Public Safety that will feature unarmed officers, who will be sent out to nonviolent emergencies. The city will still have armed officers as well but plans to reduce their list of duties, having them focus more on violent crime, while experts in things like mental health handle related crises.\n\nPerhaps the city that has made the most progress toward this sort of reorientation is Minneapolis.\n\nIn June 2020, 13 days after Floyd died, nine city council members gathered in Minneapolis's Powderhorn Park and promised to \"dismantle\" the city's police department and \"create a new, transformative model for cultivating safety in Minneapolis.\"\n\nEfforts to fulfill that promise began quickly; the council unanimously passed a resolution on June 12 that laid out a plan for beginning \"a year long process of community engagement, research, and structural change to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety.\"\n\nThat process saw some early successes, including changes to the police department's use of force policy, but the push to dismantle the police department - a reform that would require amending Minneapolis's city charter , given that document's language mandating the city have a police department of a certain size and meeting certain characteristics - failed last fall.\n\nBut the activists and politicians advocating for dismantling have not given up: Three members of the city council have introduced a new proposal to rewrite the city charter that hopes to avoid the pitfalls that ended the first effort, and a diverse coalition of activists united under the name Yes 4 Minneapolis recently gathered the necessary signatures to guarantee that a ballot initiative on changing the charter, and dismantling the department, will be put before voters during municipal elections this fall.\n\n\"The reality is reforms have not worked,\" JaNaé Bates, communications director for the advocacy groups ISAIAH and Faith in Minnesota, said. \"There are well-documented decades of reform that the Minneapolis police department has been through. And they have also demonstrably shown that they are completely resilient to reform.\"\n\nBecause of that, Bates - and many other activists - told me that the sweeping change represented by the charter amendment is necessary.\n\nThe council members' and Yes 4 Minneapolis's proposals are very similar. As with Ithaca's plan, neither would take away armed police officers; instead, both would place them in a newly created department of public safety, which would also contain other safety officials, including mental health experts and anti-violence professionals. Both plans also would mandate that the leader of this department be nominated by the mayor and approved by the city council; each leaves room for the expansion and redefinition of the department.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, both would eliminate the staffing and budget language around police written into the city charter - no longer would the city, by law, need to have at least 0.0017 police department employees per resident.\n\nThe proposals differ in minor ways. The Yes 4 Minneapolis proposal, for instance, mandates that the Department of Public Safety focus on \"a comprehensive public health approach to safety,\" language the city council plan lacks. The council proposal outlines how the police chief will be selected (by the mayor and approved by the council), details the Yes 4 Minneapolis plan doesn't include.\n\nEach has a different path to November's ballot: The city council proposal made it out of committee in March, and will ultimately need to be approved by the mayor, or a veto-proof majority of the council. The Yes 4 Minneapolis proposal needed 20,000 signatures; it crossed that threshold, was validated by the Minneapolis clerk in May, and is now undergoing legal review by the city.\n\nIn order to be instituted, the proposals only need to be approved by the majority of voters. And while there are currently two ideas circulating, the council members and activists plan to reconcile their language before ballots are printed so that voters wouldn't be presented with two nearly identical ballot initiatives.\n\nAlthough the election season isn't yet in full swing, supporters of the proposals are optimistic that voters will approve the change. In a July 2020 ACLU of Minnesota/Fairness Project/Benenson Strategy Group poll investigating support for the first incarnation of the city council charter change, 56 percent of registered voters said they were supportive of the idea, and 61 percent said they were leaning toward voting for it.\n\nAs with the defunding and oversight proposals, the Minneapolis charter change would not be a panacea: There would be no guarantees that the armed officers in the Department of Public Safety wouldn't kill any unarmed people or abuse their power.\n\n\"I'm not sure if it's gonna be the one thing that's gonna change policing,\" council member Andrea Jenkins said. \"I'm Black. Racism is at the core of this. So policies can change, laws can change, and people still act out of racial animus.\"\n\nMany I spoke to about their city's reform efforts agreed with Jenkins, arguing that while police reform is necessary, it ultimately is one part of a larger system that has traditionally disadvantaged people of color, women, low-income people, and others, a system that was put in place before anyone alive now was born and that was legally structured in a way meant to ensure the rights and privileges of white landowning men and the continued viability of the use of slave labor.\n\nThe harm police visit on communities, Austin Justice Coalition's Moore said, is a symptom of the fact that \"the formula for American pie is white supremacy, and racism, and homophobia, and all that shit.\"\n\n\"We need an American pie that does not use those ingredients,\" Moore said. \"Let's get in the fucking kitchen. And let's whip it up.\"\n\nAs the pace of progress on police reform has proven, whipping up a new pie is likely to take significant time and effort - should the will to do so be found. Larger issues of racism and structural inequality aside, though, there is currently will to revise policing, and that's where so many activists and communities around the US are focusing their energy now.\n\n\"People have to understand that police is just the front door into a broken system,\" Hardesty said. \"Yes, we must change policing, because it is the front door. But we have to change the entire system. ... That's the hard work ahead.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat's the purpose of sharing violent police videos anymore, other than to traumatize Black communities?\n\nby Allissa V. Richardson\n\nGeorge Floyd cried out for his mother in his final moments. Adam Toledo did not have time to.\n\nTwo deaths at the hands of police. One prolonged. The other sudden. Both tragic. These are the haunting bookends that modern footage of police brutality gave us in just the last week.\n\nThe historic trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who murdered George Floyd, has ended with a rare conviction . To make their respective cases, both the defense and the prosecution looped traumatic videos of Floyd's 2020 death in Minneapolis, providing an extraordinary amount of photographic evidence of what happened. The fact that it took that much video documentation of the crime - from multiple angles, played over and over again - to produce such a rare moment of accountability says so much about how much our society values the police over Black lives.\n\nThe same week of testimony during this historic trial, national news outlets began to report on Daunte Wright , a 20-year-old Black motorist whom Brooklyn Center police shot fatally on April 11 - just 10 miles from where Floyd took his last breaths. By Wednesday, I watched in horror as police pepper-sprayed 2nd Lt. Caron Nazario , who is Black and Latino, in his military uniform during a Virginia traffic stop. His video played repeatedly on all of the major cable networks.\n\nAnd by Thursday, 13-year-old Adam Toledo , who is Latino, appeared on my TV and smartphone screen, holding his hands up to surrender to a Chicago police officer who shot him fatally in less than two seconds on March 29, tuning the scales of trauma to an unbearable pitch for so many.\n\nWhat are we to gain, I asked myself, from the continued viewing of these videos? I'm a social scientist, so I think about this perhaps more often than most people. For the last 10 years, I have studied how African Americans use mobile and social media to document police brutality. Like many, I hoped initially that the rise in this documentation would lead to widespread policy changes across the country.\n\nThis system of American policing has created a diabolical cycle of citizen witnessing\n\nI thought that if people finally could see the true horror that many Black and brown people faced daily in their own communities, then change would come swiftly. In the same way that the civil rights movement gained steam because of the horrific Emmett Till photographs, I knew that there was power in having visual proof - or even a visual counternarrative when police lie , as they did with Toledo's death and Laquan McDonald's.\n\nLast year was a breaking point for me, though. Seeing George Floyd dying on primetime television, over and over again, was too much. It felt voyeuristic - not valiant - because I realized that Black deaths were the only ones that the news media aired on TV.\n\nAmid the global Black Lives Matter uprisings last year, I voiced concern for how news organizations were handling Floyd's video. In magazines, on TV, and on the radio, I pleaded with journalists to consider the trauma that African Americans face when they see their loved one's demise instant-replayed on TV, like sports highlights. I urged the public to think before posting Black death to their social media timelines. I suggested that people equate these fatal police encounter videos to modern-day lynching photographs, which deserve somber respect instead of casual viewing.\n\nThis message went viral. Journalists from around the world called and emailed me for advice about how to report on police brutality without showing these images. Many reporters asked me if a freeze-frame before the moment of death would be more respectful than showing the whole video. I remember offering a reluctant \"yes.\" But seeing the still frame of Daunte Wright terrified in his car, or witnessing Adam Toledo's hands up in surrender, has changed my mind. Even the abridged videos have been traumatizing.\n\nLast week, I realized that we have been asking the wrong questions all along. The questions never should have been, \"Do we have a video of this police killing?\" o r, \"Was the officer's body cam on?\" Instead, we should have been asking ourselves why we ever demanded that marginalized communities produce this kind of visual \"proof\" in the first place. Why were Black and brown people forced to pre-litigate their own murder trials in this way? Why was it necessary to form a counternarrative to the old stereotype of Black and brown folks' criminality? Why did we ever need to produce a parallel storyline to an official police report ?\n\nThis system of American policing has created a diabolical cycle of citizen witnessing. First, the cycle demands that a victim's family share their loved one's tragic last moments with the public. Then, it invites those moments to be picked apart, first by the news media and eventually a jury - and that's if the case ever goes to trial. Finally, it leaves the slain to be entombed online, often without the family's consent. Then, the cycle repeats with a new person, a new family, a new headline, and a new hashtag.\n\nThe center cannot hold. The same Black and brown communities that are being asked to remain calm, stay compliant, and endure stoically are the same groups who watched the January 6 siege on the Capitol unfold. They watched as white insurrectionists broke into a federal building - with the aid of many police who opened doors for them - and lived to tell about it. They watched, also, as another child - 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse , who is white - crossed state lines from Illinois to Wisconsin with the intent to shoot anti-police brutality protesters in August 2020. When Rittenhouse approached police, wearing an assault rifle and having killed two people, police gave him bottled water and later sent him financial donations for his legal fees.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I now believe that circulating videos of Black and brown death at the hands of police reinforces white supremacy. It does not deter it. These videos are no longer exposing a corrupt police system. They are a reminder of a social hierarchy that privileges police with qualified immunity, rewards racist vigilantes with internet fame and money, and punishes communities of color with death if they question that order.\n\nI am calling for a moratorium on broadcasting these videos on television and online unless the victim's family consents to such publicity. In the same way that an amendment to the Comstock Act of 1873 banned the circulation of lynching postcards in the US postal system, legislators can use the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 (BDEA) to fine TV news outlets and social media platforms that continue to profit from these traumatic images.\n\nPresident George Bush passed BDEA to increase the indecency fines tenfold after the infamous Nipplegate incident at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. It is bewildering to think that Justin Timberlake popping a piece off Janet Jackson's corset - to reveal her bare breast on TV - was considered obscene enough to inspire new legislation, while airing fatal police footage continues to be allowed.\n\nRemoving the financial incentive for news media to air these ghastly videos may force journalists to engage in more reparative storytelling. This kind of journalism would not play the Toledo video in slow motion in search of a gun. It would ask, instead, what kind of systemic failures led to a 13-year-old being outside at 2 in the morning in the first place? What kind of endemic biases led Virginia police to disregard Lt. Nazario's military uniform, to regard instead his other uniform, his Blackness? What kind of systemic cruelty led Chauvin to believe that George Floyd's pleas for his life did not matter? These are the hard questions that policy, not more police footage, can answer. This is where journalism must go next.\n\nThe road to dismantling deadly policing will be long. I believe news media can help jumpstart the process though, by doing away with the false idea that African American and Latinx communities need to play this game of video empathy before justice. It is time to simply start believing communities of color. We have enough proof. We have enough pain. What we don't have is reform. And we owe that to so many people, especially to those who have called out for their mothers from the pavement, and to those who expired even before they had that chance.\n\nAllissa V.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe police killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests, explained.\n\nby Emily Stewart\n\nThe death of George Floyd , an unarmed 46-year-old black man killed by police during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has sparked protests across the country. It has reignited a centuries-long conversation around racism in America and the horrendous ways black people are often treated by police. And it came amid a pandemic that is disproportionately impacting people of color .\n\nOn May 25, Floyd, who had recently lost his job as a restaurant bouncer due to coronavirus-related closures, died after being pinned down under a police officer's knee for several minutes. That officer, Derek Chauvin, ignored Floyd's pleas of distress as three other officers looked on and bystanders begged Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd's neck.\n\nA video taken by a bystander and posted online spread quickly on social media. It shows that by the time Chauvin stopped holding Floyd down, he was silent and motionless. According to a criminal complaint filed against Chauvin , an officer on the scene checked for Floyd's pulse before Chauvin removed his knee and could not find it. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nChauvin and the three other officers involved in the incident were fired on Tuesday, May 26, and on Friday, May 29, Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On June 3, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison elevated the charges to second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and the three other officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting murder. Chauvin's bail has been set at at least $1 million .\n\nThe incident has rightly prompted outrage across the country, and thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Minneapolis - and in cities across the country and the world. While many of these protests have been peaceful, some have turned violent, with police clashes, burning buildings, and looting.\n\nThe protests have been focused on policing, but come during a 2020 that has been acutely painful for people of color. The coronavirus crisis has disproportionately affected black and Latino Americans, who have become sick and died of Covid-19 at higher rates than whites. The economic turmoil brought on by stay-at-home measures has also hit people of color especially hard - they've lost more jobs , and they were less likely to be financially stable in the first place.\n\nAdd to that a cascade of headlines of black Americans whose lives have been cut short by white violence and by police in recent weeks - Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery , and, most recently, Floyd. As Americans were grappling with these tragic headlines, a video went viral of a white woman feigning her life was being threatened by a black man bird-watching in New York's Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog. It was a reminder that beyond concerns over state violence, systematic racism creates potentially dangerous situations for black Americans doing even the most mundane things.\n\nThe protests spawned by the deaths of Floyd and others are hardly a new development in the United States - the deaths of Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown , Sandra Bland , and countless others have led to significant public outcry in recent years. Four years before Floyd's fatal arrest in Minneapolis, Philando Castile was shot to death during a traffic stop in a nearby Minnesota suburb. Floyd told the officer who kept his knee on his neck, \"I can't breathe,\" echoing the words of Eric Garner who died after being held in a chokehold in a police encounter in New York in 2014.\n\nIf it feels like we've seen this crisis before, it's because we have. And still so many things haven't changed.\n\nFloyd grew up in Houston and moved to Minneapolis in 2014 to look for work, according to CBS Minnesota . He got a position as a security guard at a Salvation Army store downtown, and then later began to work two jobs as a truck driver and a bouncer. He had a 6-year-old daughter who still lives in Houston with her mother. In the weeks before his death, he'd been laid off due to Minnesota's stay-at-home order.\n\nVox's Catherine Kim explained the circumstances of his May 25 encounter with police following a purchase at a convenience store and, ultimately, his death, as shown by video footage captured of the incident:\n\nAlthough the video doesn't capture the moments leading to the arrest, the Minneapolis Police Department said they were responding to a call that a man was trying to use a $20 counterfeit bill, according to the Star Tribune . In a statement , the police department said officers arrived at the scene to find Floyd - who matched the description of the suspect - sitting on a car and appearing to be intoxicated. They added that Floyd physically resisted the police and seemed to be \"suffering medical distress,\" which is why they had called for an ambulance.\n\nThe police's excessive use of force seemingly has no excuse: The department does not permit the technique that was used to pin Floyd's head to the ground, according to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey .\n\nThe four officers involved were fired on Tuesday, May 26, and the next day, Mayor Frey called for Chauvin to face criminal charges. Local officials on Thursday said they were investigating Floyd's death \"as expeditiously, as thoroughly, and as completely as justice demands\" and asked for patience from the public. At the end of the week, Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, and the Justice Department said it would investigate Floyd's death as well. Chauvin's wife filed for divorce . The next week, the charges were elevated to second-degree murder.\n\nThe day the officers involved were fired, the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement that all video of the incident should be reviewed, and called for waiting on the medical examiner's report. \"Officers' actions and training protocol will be carefully examined after the officers have provided their statements,\" the federation said.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint against Chauvin, the officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds during which Floyd was \"non-responsive.\" Officer J.A. Keung - another of the four officers fired - tried to find Floyd's pulse shortly after he became unresponsive, and could not.\n\nAutopsies performed by the county medical examiner and an independent medical examiner commissioned by Floyd's family ruled homicide as the cause of death, but some details of their determinations differ. The Hennepin County medical examiner said Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.\" The independent autopsy determined that he died of asphyxia.\n\nChauvin and Floyd appear to have worked together as nightclub security guards. Floyd's family has suggested that they believe Chauvin knew who Floyd was and think the killing was partly personal.\n\nThe delay in charges against the other officers involved in Floyd's death was cause for consternation. On May 31, George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, in an interview with CNN's Don Lemon said the other officers should also be in jail. \"They're at home right now sleeping in their bed, relaxing,\" he said. \"[Chauvin's] in jail, he's only one. The other three need to be in there. My brother - he's in the morgue. That's not right. I want justice now. He deserves that.\"\n\nThe network then connected him with Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who was speaking to CNN reporter Sara Sidner at a protest. She asked him whether the other officers would be arrested.\n\n\"Being silent or not intervening - to me, you're complicit. So I don't see a level of distinction any different,\" Arradondo said. \"So obviously the charging and those decisions will have to come through our county attorney's office. Certainly, the FBI is investigating that. But to the Floyd family, I want you to know that my decision to fire all four officers was not based on some sort of hierarchy. Mr. Floyd died in our hands.\"\n\nThe three other officers were later charged with aiding in the killing. The Minneapolis City Council has also begun debating the future of the city's police department and is weighing ways to disband and rebuild its law enforcement and public safety apparatus .\n\nThe public reaction to Floyd's death has been swift and enormous.\n\nPoliticians, celebrities, athletes, and multiple other public figures have spoken out. A few days after Floyd's death, former President Barack Obama released a lengthy statement calling for the country to work for a \"new normal\" for black Americans. \"This shouldn't be normal in 2020 America,\" he wrote. He also made a lengthy post on Medium about the way forward and delivered public remarks about police brutality, violence, and protests at a town hall .\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden called the moment a \"national crisis\" and one that necessitates \"leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.\" President Donald Trump expressed his condolences to Floyd's family and said he spoke with them , though he has fanned the flames of division during the protests.\n\nEven members of law enforcement spoke out condemning the circumstances in which Floyd was killed. \"To be honest with you, it was very difficult to watch,\" Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith told local news outlet WBRC . He continued, \"It degrades the trust in all law enforcement, not just one area. When things like this happen, it spreads throughout the country. It makes all of us go back and check our relationships and make sure we are doing things the right way.\"\n\nProtests have been ignited in Minneapolis - and across the country - as people express their outrage not only about Floyd's death, but about the underlying racism and inequality that renders being black in America dangerous, particularly at the hands of police.\n\nMinneapolis has seen days of unrest. There have been a number of peaceful protests, but some businesses there have been looted and vandalized, and police stations and other buildings burned down. Demonstrations have become increasingly volatile as local officials have asked the public for peace . The governor called for the full mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nUprisings have also spread across the country . Protests in Atlanta became tense and destructive - cars were set ablaze, and windows at the CNN building were smashed in. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms pleaded with protesters for calm: \"If you care about this city, then go home,\" she said at a press conference on May 29.\n\nRapper Killer Mike, in a speech at the same press conference, struck a similar tone . \"I am duty-bound to be here to simply say that it is your duty not to burn down your own house for anger with an enemy,\" he said.\n\nProtesters and police have also clashed in New York City. Cars were set on fire and windshields were smashed, and both protesters and police were harmed. According to ABC 7 , there were more than 200 arrests reported in a single night. In San Jose, California, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Washington, DC and multiple cities and small towns across the country, protests and arrests are taking place . Crowds of protesters have gathered outside of the White House as well, and at one point, law enforcement released tear gas on peaceful demonstrators so the president could have a photo op. Police and even some protesters have targeted journalists covering the demonstrations.\n\nDisturbing videos of police violence emerged online, including one of an officer pushing a woman to the ground in Brooklyn and another of officers pushing a 75-year-old man to the ground and then walking past him as he bleeds from his head in Buffalo, New York.\n\nSome of the details of the protests have been a little bit murky, including whether some protesters who destroyed property traveled from other areas . There has been some suggestion that white supremacists, cartels, or other bad actors may be involved, but that hasn't been confirmed.\n\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who has taken part in protests in the city, in late May noted he saw \"non-black allies in particular\" escalating the situation. \"That decision should not be yours to make,\" he warned . He also spoke out about the \"heavy police presence\" at the outset of some protests, before anyone has even been outside. \"We are dealing with people who are grieving and who are angry. The response to that cannot be a show of force,\" he said.\n\nSome states have mobilized the National Guard to respond, and mayors have enacted curfews to try to tamp down demonstrations. It is not clear how effective these will be at stemming the protests. New York City ended its curfew early.\n\nPresident Trump isn't helping the situation. At one point, Trump tweeted out an apparent threat to protesters declaring, \" When the looting starts, the shooting starts ,\" mirroring language used by segregationist law enforcement officials during the civil rights era. In the same tweet, the president called demonstrators \"THUGS.\" Twitter put a warning on the tweet saying it glorifies violence , fueling the fire of the president's battle with the social media platform.\n\nTrump later walked back the tweet , saying he was trying to warn that looting could lead to shootings because it intensifies the situation.\n\nThe president has continued to weigh in on the protests, suggesting they're driven by antifascists and the \"Radical Left,\" and lashing out at the media for its coverage of the demonstrations. He also commended the Secret Service for protecting him from White House protests - and suggested one Saturday night should be \"MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.\" He has blamed demonstrations on antifa and sought to cast protesters as terrorists, in a call with governors urging \"retribution\" and saying the country is perceived as \"weak.\" He floated a conspiracy theory that the 75-year-old Buffalo man knocked over by police was an antifa \"provocateur.\"\n\nBeyond the debates about the tactics demonstrators are using and who is and isn't involved, there is a much deeper issue here that must remain in focus: the way black people are treated in the United States.\n\nAs Vox's Dylan Scott put it, violent protests aren't the story right now, police violence is :\n\nOf course the protests are about George Floyd's death. Political leaders fear violence at the protests - and any destruction of property or bodily harm is, of course, worrisome - but their concerns actually demonstrate the fundamental asymmetry that the protesters are pushing back against. The state has a monopoly on legitimate violence, and it is often directed at young black people like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice - the list goes on. When they die, the police officers responsible too frequently face no repercussions because they are protected by the law. If the men who killed George Floyd go to prison for their actions, they will be exceptions that prove that longstanding rule.\n\nAs Scott lays out, there are countless data points on how black Americans are targeted and mistreated by law enforcement. Black men have 1 in 1,000 odds of being killed by the police. Black people are twice as likely as whites to be pulled over by police, and they're likelier to be searched. When they're murdered, their murders are less likely to be solved. They're sent to prison more often, and they are given longer prison sentences.\n\nAnd for black Americans, these aren't data points - they are real and lived situations each and every day.\n\nAnd racial disparities are not just limited to criminal justice. Inequities are present in so many aspects of American life. Just look at the coronavirus crisis: The disease is disproportionately sickening and killing people of color , and it's hitting in areas where minorities live harder. That's true in Minnesota , where Floyd lived. Women of color are disproportionately essential workers who are putting themselves at risk, often for low-paid jobs with no health insurance. Black and Hispanic people are likelier to be laid off or furloughed during the pandemic . That's what happened to Floyd.\n\nIn the flurry of news around the protests of Floyd's death, on top of everything else, it can be easy to lose sight of the real problem: The centuries of racism in the bedrock of American society continue to do enormous damage. And that damage is borne in large part by black Americans.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIn the Derek Chauvin trial, the defense's attempt to blame George Floyd's death on drug use relies on retrograde and racist myths.\n\nby Carl L. Hart\n\nMy emotions teeter between exasperation and outrage each day I read the trial recap of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd.\n\nI'm not naïve. I know how these killer cop trials go. The defense drags the deceased victim's reputation through the mud - \"he was a big Black man prone to violence\" or \"he was under the influence of a drug\" - to create a smoke screen, to generate empathy for the cop. From Michael Brown to Philando Castile, too many judges and juries have fallen victim to this tired ploy - the \"drug-crazed Negro\" script -when a white police officer kills a Black person.\n\nTrue to form, Mr. Chauvin's lawyers have tried to deflect blame from his brutal act onto the drugs found in Mr. Floyd's body at the time of his death. \"The evidence will show that Mr. Floyd died of a cardiac arrhythmia that occurred as a result of hypertension, his coronary disease, ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and the adrenaline flowing through his body,\" defense attorney Eric Nelson told the jury. In other words, Mr. Floyd might still be alive today had he not taken drugs. Shame on us if we buy this bogus defense this time.\n\nI'm a neuropsychopharmacologist who researches drug addiction. My work has focused on the unjust and unscientific stigmas surrounding drug use and the criminalization of drugs around the globe. The defense's attempt to paint Mr. Floyd as a crazed drug addict relies on retrograde myths about the impact of drugs on our bodies and minds.\n\nWhile it's true Mr. Floyd had small amounts of methamphetamine and THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, in his blood - 19 and 2.9 nanograms per milliliter, respectively - those numbers strongly suggest he hadn't used them in at least several hours, maybe a day.\n\nAlso, Mr. Floyd's methamphetamine levels were far below those I have found, in my laboratory research on dozens of participants, necessary to induce significantly elevated cardiovascular activity: greater than 25 nanograms per milliliter. The amount of methamphetamine (and THC) found in Mr. Floyd's blood was too low for it to have had any meaningful effect on him.\n\nHis blood also had 11 nanograms of fentanyl, America's latest vilified drug. Fentanyl (or its analogs) that is laced with heroin or other drugs and sold illegally for recreational use can be very dangerous or deadly. But it's important that we don't fall prey to misinformed and dangerous myths about the drug. Media reports , government agencies, and law enforcement have repeatedly claimed that minuscule amounts of skin exposure to the drug can cause an overdose. This is incontrovertibly false. As fear around fentanyl grows, so too does criminalization: In Florida, for example, a fentanyl-related overdose death can result in a drug-induced homicide charge for traffickers , even if many are unaware that what they are selling has been cut with the drug.\n\nYou should know, too, that fentanyl is an FDA-approved opioid medication used in the treatment of severe pain. In the United States, the drug has been used for this purpose for more than 50 years. It even comes in a child-friendly, sweetened lollipop formulation. Fentanyl is a safe and effective medication when used as prescribed.\n\nSo, what does 11 nanograms of fentanyl tell us about Mr. Floyd's mental and physical state moments before his death? Not much, because the same amount of fentanyl that produces pleasure in a tolerant user can result in an overdose in an infrequent user. That's why, together with the toxicology report, we have to interpret Mr. Floyd's behavior shortly before he was killed, which is a barometer of a person's impairment.\n\nWe saw that he was emotionally appropriate and behaving rationally, considering the circumstances. Minutes before his encounter with police, he purchased an item from a deli and was about to leave when officers asked him to get out of his car. Together, these observations suggest he had developed some level of tolerance to fentanyl-related effects and show how unlikely it is that drugs played a role in his death. People on the verge of dying from an opioid overdose are inactive and look visibly drowsy. He was neither.\n\nInstead, videos show Mr. Chauvin callously pressing his knee into Mr. Floyd's neck as he repeatedly yelled out \"I can't breathe\" - a rational reaction - until he became unresponsive, while two other officers helped pin him down by applying pressure to his back. Two different medical examiners - one from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office and one hired by Mr. Floyd's family - classified Mr. Floyd's death a homicide , corroborating what we all saw with our own eyes.\n\nBut if history is any indication, medical documentation and video evidence may not be enough to refute racist drug mythology.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the white establishment increasingly viewed drug use by racial minorities as a threat to the social order. Prominent newspapers, physicians, and politicians peddled lurid, false stories about Chinese opium-den owners inducing white women into their establishments to defile them. Officials concocted tales about Black men who took cocaine turning into homicidal criminals impervious to bullets and forcing white women into prostitution. Others promoted incredible stories about Black and Mexican American marijuana users and violent crimes . These fabrications facilitated passage of the country's first nationwide drug laws.\n\nThe racialized drug-crazed rhetoric of the past has not passed. It is revitalized with each new generation.\n\nSome version of this played-out defense was put forth when former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed teenager Michael Brown, when former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shot and killed teenager Laquan McDonald, when former Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed a defenseless Philando Castile, and when former Tulsa police officer Betty Jo Shelby shot and killed a nonthreatening Terence Crutcher. Drugs did not contribute to any of these individuals' deaths. But officers' depraved indifference for Black life certainly did.\n\nFor centuries, the myth of the drug-crazed Negro has exonerated police from barbaric killings of Black Americans. This will change when the humanity of people who look like George Floyd is valued, by the dominant culture, equally to that of white women. It will not change a minute sooner.\n\nCarl L. Hart is the Dirk Ziff professor of psychology (in psychiatry) at Columbia University and author of the forthcoming Drug Use for Grown-ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe bill bans chokeholds and would end qualified immunity for police officers.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nThe House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Bill of 2021 - legislation that Democratic lawmakers believe will reduce police violence against people of color, particularly Black Americans, while also improving policing for everyone.\n\n\"At some point, we have to ask ourselves, how many more people have to die? How many more people have to be brutalized on videotape?\" Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), who led the bill, said ahead of its passage. \"We must act now to transform policing in the United States.\"\n\nThe bill, which was also passed in 2020 , succeeded on partisan lines: 219 to 213, with no Republicans voting with the Democratic majority.\n\nIn June 2020, House Democrats crafted identical legislation in response to the worldwide demonstrations against police brutality that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd by then-Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin - and that were sustained by the deaths of dozens of other Black Americans, including Breonna Taylor , Daniel Prude , and Rayshard Brooks .\n\nSince then, police violence against Black Americans has not waned. In the first few months of 2021, police have killed at least 23 Black Americans; prominent incidents of violence include an officer in Rochester, New York, pepper-spraying a handcuffed 9-year-old girl , and police killing 52-year-old Patrick Lynn Warren following a mental health 911 call placed on his behalf.\n\nOne provision in the bill addresses qualified immunity , a legal precedent that gives government officials, including police officers, broad protections against lawsuits. Among other things, the bill would also create a national database of police misconduct and require federal law enforcement officials to use body and dash cameras. To curtail deaths, the legislation bans federal law enforcement from using chokeholds like the one that ended Floyd's life, and from using no-knock warrants in drug cases - Taylor was killed when police burst into her home using such a warrant in March 2020.\n\nPolice reformers critical of the bill have questioned whether it would be effective, noting that most of its provisions make changes only at the federal level - the federal government has very little control over how state and local governments choose to police their populations.\n\n\"This legislation, while vitally important, is not perfect,\" said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which backs the bill. \"No legislation is. But it represents meaningful progress, and we intend to continue working with lawmakers to strengthen and build upon it.\"\n\nBefore the bill can be expanded upon, though, it has to pass the Senate - and its success there is uncertain.\n\nRepublicans favor a more limited police reform proposal from Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) that Democrats dismissed as too small in scope .\n\nNow Democrats are in charge of the Senate. There, Virginia Democrats Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Don Beyer are proposing an amendment to the George Floyd bill that would track the costs of police misconduct settlements . Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is \"committed\" to the bill, Kaine said, and Schumer recently told reporters , \"I'm putting bills on the floor. People are going to be forced to vote on them, yes or no.\"\n\nBass told reporters that Democrats have been in conversation with Scott, but whether the Democratic caucus can find the 10 Republican votes it needs to get the bill through the Senate remains to be seen. Given the difficulty Democrats have had so far in this Congress winning Republican support for President Joe Biden's Cabinet nominees and Covid-19 relief , winning over 10 GOP senators may be a tall order.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nBroadly, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 tries to do four things at the federal level: make the prosecution of police misconduct easier, expand federal oversight into local police units, limit bias among officers, and change policing tactics.\n\nThe bill works to encourage state and local governments to adopt its federal reforms through penalties - those that don't make changes, or that refuse to comply with the bill's data submission requirements, would lose access to federal policing funding, and in some cases, that funding would be redistributed to those departments that do cooperate.\n\nIt is unclear whether those penalties would be enough to incentivize compliance. Some reformers critical of the bill say they would not, as most police funding comes from state and local sources: State and local governments spent about $120 billion on policing in 2018, according to the US Census Bureau , to which the federal government contributed about $5 billion .\n\nHere's how the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 works:\n\nThe bill attempts to make it easier to hold individual law enforcement officers accountable through changes to existing law and practice.\n\nFor one, it rewrites the federal law on abuse of power , US Code Title 18, Section 242. Currently, prosecutors who want to convict an officer of misconduct must generally prove they deprived someone \"of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution,\" and that officer did so \"willfully\" - \"voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.\"\n\nThis is very hard to prove.\n\nSo the Justice in Policing Act changes the word \"willfully\" in Section 242 to \"knowingly or recklessly,\" essentially requiring a prosecutor to prove misconduct was not done accidentally or without the understanding that it could cause some harm .\n\n\"Knowingly or recklessly sounds like legal jargon, but it's frankly a well-established, intense standard and criminal law throughout the country,\" Damon Hewitt, the executive vice president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said. \"It will be game-changing.\"\n\nHewitt cited the killings of Tamir Rice , Sean Bell , and Amadou Diallo as examples of the effect changing Section 242's language might have.\n\n\"In each case, federal prosecutors declined prosecution because they felt they could not satisfy the so-called willfulness standard,\" Hewitt said. \"It's so rare for federal prosecutors to feel that they have sufficient evidence to satisfy this willfulness standard, beyond a reasonable doubt, that on average, only about 40 or so defendants every year are prosecuted in the United States.\"\n\nHowever, Philip Matthew Stinson - a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University and former police officer - cautioned that changing the standard won't necessarily change legal outcomes, pointing to how often officers are cleared in jury trials: \"As soon as the officer testifies in their own defense, it's game over for the prosecution, and you just can't get a conviction, even in these cases where we've got video that just is damning.\"\n\nThe other major change the bill makes is barring officers from being eligible for qualified immunity - a concept established by the courts that shields public officials from being sued. As Vox's Ian Millhiser explains, qualified immunity \"only protects government employees whose conduct 'does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\"\n\nThis \"test set up by the courts for its application has proven to be entirely unworkable,\" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said. \"Its application has been so distorted by courts that it's operated to virtually ensure that police officers are held civilly responsible for even the most monstrous acts of misconduct.\"\n\nThe federal government doesn't have much data on police misconduct; most databases - like Mapping Police Violence or Stinson's Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database - have been compiled by private groups. There's bipartisan agreement that this should change; the 2020 GOP policing bill called for data collection on use of force incidents.\n\nThe Justice in Policing Act hopes to expand access to policing data by establishing publicly accessible databases run by the Justice Department on police use of force and misconduct allegations. The use of force database would have details on whether the victim was armed, what the officer was trying to accomplish, and what efforts the officer took to deescalate the situation before using violence; the misconduct registry would include active and dismissed allegations as well as ones that were sustained. Beyer and Kaine's amendment would add to these databases one that tracks the cost of police settlements.\n\nGrants would be made available to smaller departments needing infrastructure assistance to meet these requirements, and any department failing to submit this data would lose access to federal funding.\n\nThe success of this part of the bill hinges on departments complying with these new mandates - and reformers have been mixed on whether they will.\n\nHenderson suggested state and local governments will give the federal government this data: \"States should not rely on federal prodding, trying to withhold funding as the basis of their decision on whether to provide data. We think moral suasion, pressure, encouraging them to offer data, which we know they have at their disposal, is the better way to encourage them to take action.\"\n\nStinson disagreed, pointing to the limited response the FBI has had in its efforts to collect use of force data , as well as the difficulty the federal government has had in getting state and local departments to fill out a census of agencies .\n\nHe also questioned the purity of any data that is collected, saying, \"Lying is a normal part of policing in many places across the country. Police officers lie in their reports. They write narratives up to justify the actions that they wanted to take or did take.\"\n\nBeyond collecting data, the Justice in Policing Act works to strengthen federal oversight over state and local law departments.\n\nFor instance, it gives new subpoena powers to the US attorney general to investigate law enforcement groups that have been accused of having engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of unconstitutional conduct. It also bestows those same subpoena abilities on state attorneys general, and empowers them to fix pattern or practice constitutional violations at the state and local level. The DOJ would also be required to begin publicly reporting how many of these investigations have been launched, are active, or closed.\n\nThe bill would also charge the US attorney general with:\n\nAdditionally, the bill would create pilot programs to study how the implementation of new standards and adoption of new techniques (like deescalation practices, for instance) improve policing. New grants would be established to help fund community organizations that work on policing; to study and promote hiring, training, and oversight; and to assist departments in developing new policing techniques and public safety protocols.\n\nThe bill would make racial profiling in law enforcement illegal, would mandate that federal law enforcement officers undergo racial bias training, and tasks the DOJ with creating a racial profiling and racial bias training program.\n\nIdeally, mandating racial bias training would change the disproportionate number of people of color killed by police, but as Vox's Julia Belluz wrote, whether they work is a subject of great debate.\n\nFor instance, a 2020 report on the New York Police Department's implicit bias program found it had little effect on police interactions with people of color; in fact, stops and frisks of Black residents went up slightly following the sessions - 1 percentage point for stops and 2 percentage points for frisks - which underscores the fears some researchers have about these trainings.\n\n\"Training can bring bias to the surface,\" Harvard sociologist Frank Dobbin told Belluz. \"It can activate stereotypes.\"\n\nNo-knock warrants, which allow police to enter private property without announcing themselves, would be banned at the federal level in drug cases under the bill; the warrants would still be allowed in other types of cases.\n\nThese warrants became the subject of national attention following the death of Breonna Taylor , whom police killed in her home after they forced their way into her apartment unannounced, looking for someone who did not live there. Arguably, this would also make police officers safer; unsure who was breaking into the apartment, Taylor's partner - who was a licensed gun owner - fired a warning shot that police say injured an officer on the scene.\n\nThe bill also attempts to directly address the cause of George Floyd's death - officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - by banning chokeholds and carotid holds (which pinch the artery responsible for feeding blood to the brain) at the federal level, and classifying the use of either technique by law enforcement at all levels of government as a civil rights violation.\n\nTo curb other types of police violence, the bill prohibits federal officers from using deadly force unless all \"reasonable\" alternatives have been exhausted, including deescalation techniques, nonlethal force, and at least one verbal warning. Officers would also have to ensure there's no risk of bystanders being injured, and be positive that deadly force is the only way to avoid \"serious bodily injury or death,\" either of the officer or of someone else on the scene, before using deadly force.\n\nFederal officers would similarly be barred from using nonlethal force unless it was deemed completely necessary to apprehend a suspect, and all other avenues had been exhausted.\n\nThe bill asks that state and local governments pass laws requiring their officers to meet these same standards. As is the case with other provisions, those governments that fail to do so would lose access to federal funding.\n\nThe George Floyd Act would limit - but not end - transfers of military goods, like drones and body armor, to state and local police departments and require any request not made by a federal agency to be made public. It would prohibit the transfer of a number of weapons and vehicles, including bayonets, grenades, and drones, although it would be possible to grant waivers for banned vehicles.\n\nThe transfers would have to be used for counterterrorism or general law enforcement work - they could no longer be used for anti-drug or border security activities. Any item once allowed but banned by the bill would need to be given back to the federal government, as would any equipment given to a department found to have committed a civil rights violation.\n\nAll federal officers would be required to wear body cameras, and the bill spells out how they are to be worn, as well as when they are to be used. It makes clear they must be on for virtually all interactions with the public, unless an official is on private property without a warrant, or is speaking to the victim of a crime or to an anonymous source and is asked to switch the camera off. Officers who do not comply will be subject to disciplinary action that their superiors believe is \"appropriate.\"\n\nThe bill also requires agencies to maintain video files from the cameras for at least six months, and at least three years in certain cases, including when a recording features use of force or an interaction that a complaint is filed about. And the bill would create paths by which a member of the public featured in a given video - as well as members of their family and their legal representation - could access the footage.\n\nCameras would also be required in cars; the bill would ban the use of facial recognition technology in both the cameras and the footage. Any state and local departments willing to comply with the federal rules would be eligible for grants to expand their camera programs.\n\nResearch on whether body cameras improve outcomes is mixed , and the Justice in Policing Act hopes to make its body camera program a platform for further study of the issue: The Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management would be responsible for undertaking research on the technology's effectiveness, and would be required to submit its findings to Congress.\n\nThe Justice in Policing Act works to decrease sexual assaults by making any sexual contact between a federal officer and someone they are detaining illegal and punishable by a fine as well as up to 15 years' imprisonment.\n\nIt asks state and local governments to ban the practice as well, and prohibits any government that fails to do so - and that does not submit reports on the number of officers who do have sexual contact with those in their custody - from receiving money from the COPS program . The attorney general would be required to collect the information state and local governments submit and turn it over to the Government Accountability Office, which would analyze it and submit a report to Congress.\n\nThe full scope of police sexual misconduct is unknown - many police sexual assaults aren't reported - but a 2015 Associated Press study found 990 officers lost their licenses due to sexual violence allegations between 2009 and 2014.\n\nA number of activists, including those with the NAACP, National Urban League, and the National Action Network, support the Justice in Policing Act; other reformers argue that it does not go far enough.\n\n\"It's not a few rotten apples,\" Stinson said. \"To some extent, I think policing is rotten to the core. And I don't see how these bills, in some respects, are anything more than political crime control rhetoric.\"\n\nAnd activists like Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, believe the Justice in Policing Act is far too narrow in scope to achieve needed change.\n\n\"What if we made big moves?\" Simpson said. \"I'm not saying it's bad legislation: Everything that's in there makes sense, for the most part, it's things that people want. But is it the biggest, boldest move that we can make?\"\n\nSimpson cited the Movement for Black Lives' BREATHE Act as a proposal better suited to the policing problem.\n\nThat plan would defund many federal law enforcement groups, and use the savings to fund community programs, public safety initiatives, and policies attacking the root causes of inequity and overpolicing, as a better alternative. The BREATHE Act also uses a more complex strategy to push state and local reforms at the federal level that relies more on grants and incentives than on restricting access to federal funding.\n\nOther reformers, like a coalition of 38 groups backing proposals by the Center for Disability Rights , have called for the framework of the Justice in Policing Act to be kept, but for its policies to be taken further - for instance, that qualified immunity be abolished for all government officials rather than only officers, or that quick-knock raids be barred alongside no-knock warrants.\n\nMany of the activists who support the Justice in Policing Act do see it as a bold step; Henderson called this bill \"transformative police accountability legislation.\"\n\n\"I will tell you this, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is certainly no worse than current law,\" Hewitt said. \"It's far better.\"\n\nSign up for The Weeds newsletter .

      "text": "2 former cops convicted in George Floyd's death sentenced to prison\n\nJ. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were convicted on federal charges.\n\nTwo former police officers convicted on federal charges in the death of George Floyd were both sentenced Wednesday to prison terms.\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Paul Magnuson in back-to-back hearings.\n\nMagnuson, who noted that Kueng was a rookie cop at the time of Floyd's death, sentenced him to serve three years in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, according to St. Paul ABC affiliate KSTP .\n\nIn a separate hearing, Magnuson sentenced Thao, who had been a nine-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department at the time of Floyd's death, to 3 1/2 years in prison, also followed by two years of supervised release, KSTP reported.\n\nKueng was sentenced first in U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nPrior to Kueng being sentenced, Floyd's cousin Sabrina Montgomery and his girlfriend, Courtney Ross, gave victim impact statements.\n\nRoss addressed Kueng directly with compassion, telling him, \"This sentence will not define you,\" and urging him to \"define your purpose,\" KSTP reported.\n\n\"This does not mean you cannot find your footing to stand up for what's right in the future,\" Ross told Kueng.\n\nMontgomery asked Magnuson to give both Kueng and Thao the maximum sentence.\n\n\"All of these men deserve to serve longer sentences,\" Montgomery said, according to KSTP. \"The system these officers operated in is flawed, but again, where is their humanity?\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Manda Sertich told Magnuson that Kueng, who was a rookie cop at the time of Floyd's death, admitted during his trial testimony that he was aware that it was his duty to intervene, but he failed to act.\n\n\"All he had to do per MPD policy was attempt to intervene ... but he didn't say a word. Not one word,\" Sertich said, according to KSTP.\n\nKueng declined to make a statement in court before he was sentenced. But his attorney, Thomas Plunkett, spoke on his behalf, telling Magnuson, \"He's a nice young man that attempted to help the community by taking on a difficult role ... and now he's being sentenced for that.\"\n\nBoth Kueng, 28, and Thao, 35, were convicted by a federal jury in February along with their former police colleague Thomas Lane, 39, who received a sentence last week of 2 1/2 years in prison for violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nFederal prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 6 1/2 years for Lane, which according to federal sentencing guidelines, was the maximum.\n\nAll three men were convicted of using the \"color of the law,\" or their positions as police officers, to deprive Floyd of his civil rights by willfully being indifferent to his serious medical needs.\n\nDuring Thao's sentencing hearing, Montgomery again asked for the maximum sentence. Ross also spoke at Thao's sentencing, but did not offer him words of encouragement like she did when she addressed Kueng and called for a maximum sentence.\n\n\"Mr. Thao, as you watched my love being suffocated under the knee of your co-officer, I will never forget you saying to the onlookers, 'This is why you don't do drugs,'\" said Ross, citing video played at the officers' trial.\n\nThao's lawyer, Robert Paule, described Thao as \"a decent person who was just trying to do his job.\"\n\nThao gave a statement in court, telling Magnuson he found God after being arrested in Floyd's death and saying that he had learned to lean on his faith.\n\nProsecutors said Kueng, Thao and Lane, who was also a rookie cop, all failed to intervene as the handcuffed, unarmed 46-year-old Black man was pinned under the knee of their senior officer, Derek Chauvin, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, outside a Minneapolis convenience store where Floyd was accused of using a phony $20 bill to buy cigarettes.\n\nThao and Kueng were also convicted of violating Floyd's right to be free of an unreasonable seizure by willfully failing to intervene to prevent Chauvin from applying bodily injury to Floyd.\n\nProsecutors had requested a \"substantially higher\" federal sentence than Lane's, but far less than what Chauvin received.\n\nChauvin was sentenced on Thursday by Magnuson to serve 21 years in prison after pleading guilty in December to violating Floyd's civil rights and admitting he kept his knee on Floyd's neck even after he became unresponsive. Chauvin also pleaded guilty to depriving a then-14-year-old boy of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by an officer, which resulted in bodily injury to the teen, according to the Justice Department.\n\nMagnuson also sentenced Lane.\n\nThe length of the sentences for Kueng and Thao are lower than the recommended federal sentencing guidelines, which called for 4 1/4 years to 5 1/4 years.\n\n\"The facts of this case do not amount to second-degree murder under federal law,\" Magnuson wrote in a ruling last week. \"Defendants Kueng and Thao each made a tragic misdiagnosis in their assessment of Mr. Floyd.\"\n\nMagnuson noted that Kueng and Thao believed Floyd was suffering from a drug overdose and \"excited delirium\" -- a syndrome in which a subject displays wild agitation and violent behavior that can sometimes lead to death.\n\nLane was the only police officer involved in Floyd's fatal arrest to express concern for the man's well-being. Police body-camera video played at the three former officers' federal trial captured Lane asking twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side from a prone position to help ease his breathing.\n\nChauvin, 46, was also convicted in state court in April 2021 on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced in June 2021 by Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill to 22 1/2 years in state prison.\n\nChauvin will serve his sentence in federal prison concurrently with his state sentence.\n\nLane also pleaded guilty to state charges of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the top charge against him of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder. Lane is awaiting his sentence in state court.\n\nKueng and Thao are scheduled to be put on trial in state court on Oct. 24 on charges of aiding and abetting in murder and aiding and abetting in manslaughter. They have both pleaded not guilty.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's sentencing hearings, Ross expressed disappointment in the punishment handed down, especially for Thao.\n\n\"The sentence, particularly for Tou Thao, didn't really seem to match the crime to me,\" Ross told reporters outside the courthouse. \"I'm saddened, but I suppose we have to take all these little small triumphs and know that we're going to move forward even though there just little crumbs that they kind of keep giving us, but maybe one day we'll get a loaf of bread.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Timeline: The impact of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis and beyond\n\nGeorge Floyd died while in police custody on May 25.\n\n\"Say his name\" and \"I can't breathe.\" Words that became a national chorus in the months following the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed while being taken into police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day 2020 .\n\nIn demonstrations that drew millions in cities across the country and abroad , protesters called for police reform while mourning the death of yet another unarmed Black person at the hands of police in the United States.\n\nHere is a timeline of major events that have unfolded since Floyd's death:\n\nFloyd, 46, is arrested shortly after 8 p.m. after allegedly using a fake $20 bill at a local Cup Foods. A disturbing cellphone video later posted to Facebook shows an officer pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee on the back of Floyd's neck while a handcuffed man repeats \"I can't breathe\" and goes unconscious. He later dies at a hospital. The video goes viral.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump announces he is representing Floyd's family and \"will seek justice.\" The four officers involved in Floyd's death are fired. Demonstrators gather at the Third Precinct and the site of the incident in what becomes the first night of protests in Minneapolis.\n\nDemonstrators in other cities, including Los Angeles and Memphis, start to march in outrage over the death of Floyd. In Minneapolis, peaceful protests turn violent as fires and looting break out and cops attempt to disperse crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nIn the wake of the previous night's protests, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signs an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard. In the coming days, other governors will follow suit as tensions escalate.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the officer seen in the video kneeling on Floyd's neck, is arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. If convicted, maximum penalties for all of the charges are severe -- 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree and 10 years for the manslaughter charge.\n\nBut presiding Judge Peter Cahill is required by Minnesota law to follow sentencing guidelines. Under these, the penalty for both second degree unintentional murder and third degree is about 10 to 15 years. For the manslaughter charge, the common sentence under the guidelines is four years.\n\nWalz issues a curfew for the entire Twin Cities region; at least a dozen cities will issue curfews as bouts of violence and looting in the coming days overshadow the mostly peaceful protests. Then-President Donald Trump sparks controversy when, in response to the violent unrest, he tweets that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter flags the tweet, saying it violates its rules about \"glorifying violence.\"\n\nWalz announces that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will take over prosecutions in Floyd's death from the county prosecutor.\n\nThousands protest peacefully across the country, though some demonstrations continue to be marred by acts of vandalism and clashes with police, including near the White House.\n\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy report found that the 46-year-old Floyd died of a combination of causes including \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\" and that his system showed \"fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use.\" The ME called the manner of death \"homicide,\" but goes on in the report to state that this \"is not a legal determination of culpability or intent.\"\n\nFloyd's legal team says an independent autopsy determined that his death was a homicide caused by asphyxia \"due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain.\" On June 2, Floyd family Crump derides the Medical Examiner's report...attacking its inclusion of toxicology results: \"The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off.\"\n\nThat same day, Ellison tells SiriusXM's \"The Joe Madison Show\" that he is \"very seriously looking\" at prosecuting the other officers in the case, but that the process could take months.\n\nMinnesota's Department of Human Rights files a civil rights charge related to Floyd's death and launches an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nOfficials announce the investigation will examine the \"policies, procedures, and practices over the past 10 years\" to determine if the police department \"has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped.\"\n\nThe other three officers involved in the incident are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, both felonies, court records show.\n\nChauvin also received an additional second-degree murder charge, a felony, according to court records.\n\nMinneapolis City Council members announce their intent to disband the city's police department in favor of a more community-oriented agency. \"Our commitment is to end our city's toxic relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department, to end policing as we know it and to recreate systems of public safety that actually keep us safe,\" City Council President Lisa Bender said at a rally.\n\nCongressional Democrats introduce a sweeping police misconduct reform bill, called the Justice In Policing Act, that would look to demilitarize the police and address police brutality. Measures include banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants. While the Democrat-controlled House later approved the bill, the then-Republican-controlled Senate voted it down.\n\nThe same day as the legislation is introduced, thousands of mourners turn out in Houston, Floyd's hometown, for a public viewing of Floyd ahead of his funeral. Among those in attendance are former Vice President Joe Biden and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nThousands gather for Floyd's final funeral service . Dignitaries in attendance include the Rev. Al Sharpton, U.S. Rep. Al Green, actor Jamie Foxx and Houston Texans player J.J. Watt. Biden also speaks via video, calling for change for Black Americans.\n\nFloyd's younger brother, Philonise, testifies before Congress during a hearing on police brutality.\n\nIn a powerful opening statement , he calls on lawmakers to make law enforcement \"part of the solution, not the problem,\" so his brother's death isn't in vain.\n\nThe four fired Minneapolis police officers criminally charged in the death of Floyd appear before a judge for back-to-back pre-trial hearings attended by Floyd's aunt and uncle.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill also instructs both prosecutors and defense attorneys to limit pre-trial publicity about the case. Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, says in court that he is considering a motion for a change of venue due to what he describes as prejudicial pre-trial publicity.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council unanimously votes to rename the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, near the spot of Floyd's fatal arrest, \"George Floyd Square.\"\n\nDozens of friends, relatives and supporters gather at George Floyd Square and celebrate what would have been his 47th birthday.\n\nJudge Cahill dismisses the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, ruling that it required evidence that Chauvin's alleged actions put multiple people at risk and resulted in a death. Cahill rules that since Chauvin is accused of only targeting Floyd, the count does not apply to his case.\n\nJudge Cahill rejected defense requests to move the trial of the four former police officers.\n\n\"No corner of the State of Minnesota has been shielded from pretrial publicity regarding the death of George Floyd. Because of that pervasive media coverage, a change of venue is unlikely to cure the taint of potential prejudicial pretrial publicity,\" Cahill writes in his ruling.\n\nChauvin is ordered by Judge Cahill to stand trial alone. In separating Chauvin's trial from his three co-defendants, Cahill cited COVID-19 concerns, specifically the court's ability to ensure adequate social distancing among the defendants, their lawyers and other support personnel.\n\nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals hears oral arguments on an appeal filed by prosecutors requesting it to overturn Judge Cahill's decision to toss out third-degree murder charge against Chauvin. The three-judge panel says it will issue an expedited decision as soon as possible.\n\nThe hearing comes as Minneapolis city officials hold a briefing on plans to ramp-up security for Chauvin's trial to protect property and ensure the First Amendment rights of protesters.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with a 220-212 vote. The legislation, which still needs the approval of the Senate, would ban no-knock warrants in certain cases, mandate use-of-force data collection on police encounters, prohibit racial and religious profiling and redirect funding to community-based policing programs.\n\nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals orders Judge Cahill to reconsider reinstating a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, finding the judge erred in October when he dropped the charge.\n\nChauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, informs the court that he is filing a petition for the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision asking Judge Cahill to consider reinstating a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin.\n\nA prosecutor asks for a delay in jury selection when Cahill says he has no jurisdiction in the matter until the Supreme Court reaches a ruling, or the appellate court provides guidance on how to proceed. Cahill says that unless the appeals court tells him otherwise, jury selection will proceed.\n\nJudge Cahill grants the motion by prosecutors to reinstate the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin after hearing arguments from both sides of the case. The trial starts March 29.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council unanimously approves a $27 million settlement to Floyd's family for a civil lawsuit brought against the city of Minneapolis and the four officers involved in his death.\n\nAfter three weeks of testimony , Chauvin is found guilty on all three counts in Floyd's death. His sentencing hearing will be in eight weeks. The maximum sentence for second-degree murder is 40 years in prison, but Minnesota sentencing guidelines suggest he could get up to 15 years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the verdict , with both calling for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n\nABC News' Andy Fies, Whitney Lloyd and Bill Hutchinson contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "4 years later, George Floyd's murder leads Minneapolis police to take on reform\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council has agreed to a federal consent decree.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council has approved a consent decree agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice that will implement major reform within the Minneapolis Police Department. Per the agreement, it will be carried out under the watch of an appointed, independent court monitor.\n\nThe agreement comes after a two-year investigation from the DOJ into the MPD's patterns and practices. The investigation was prompted in part by the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, which sparked racial justice and anti-police brutality protests nationwide.\n\nThe Justice Department released its findings in a report in 2023.\n\nIt found that the Minneapolis Police Department was engaged in a pattern of discriminatory law enforcement practices, used unjustified deadly force in encounters with suspects, engaged in unreasonable use of force in encounters with young suspects, and at times failed to give proper medical aid to people they had taken into custody.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division spoke on the findings at a press conference Monday, hours after the consent decree was announced.\n\n\"The decree sets forth remedies to address the problems identified in our findings,\" Clarke said.\n\nShe identified some of those the remedies as: limiting use of force, closely regulating or eliminating some types of force altogether, and adopting a system to thoroughly and regularly evaluate uses of force; ensuring officers intervene to prevent unlawful uses of force and seek prompt medical care as needed; avoiding unnecessary stops by focusing traffic enforcement on improving public safety; protecting journalists from retaliation by law enforcement while safeguarding their access to demonstrations; and limiting the use of police officers in health-related cases.\n\nShe explained that the decree established four core goals: constitutional policing, strengthening trust and public confidence in law enforcement, promoting public safety, and ensuring freedom from discrimination and bias.\n\n\"With this consent decree we now have a roadmap for reform,\" she added, calling it a \"critical step forward\" in the city's efforts to enforce constitutional policing.\n\nShe called on the community to continue making suggestions for the police department to improve, above and beyond the perimeters of the consent decree.\n\n\"All eyes remain on Minneapolis,\" Clarke said.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also attended the briefing on Monday. He called the murder of George Floyd \"a tragedy that resonated across the globe,\" while noting that it was \"felt most acutely by Black residents of Minneapolis.\"\n\nOf the consent decree, Frey said, \"This legally binding agreement will give the city the tools and the clarity we need as we work to build trust and accountability in our communities.\"\n\n\"There aren't any shortcuts, and success is not guaranteed; we'll have to work for it,\" he said, calling for cooperation among the community, law enforcement and government officials.\n\nFrey added that the institutional issues at play did not begin with Floyd's murder, and the work will be an ongoing process, as well.\n\n\"Our administration will wake up every morning and got to bed every night with the clear goals in mind that we need to hit,\" Frey said, affirming that the city's commitment to change would be \"permanent,\" not just confined to the decree's length.\n\nThe event was also attended by Chief Brian O'Hara of the Minneapolis Police Department, who called the decree an \"opportunity\" to not only comply with its terms but to exceed expectations.\n\n\"Together we will make Minneapolis a place where everyone feels safer and where they know that Minneapolis cops have their back,\" he said.\n\nThe DOJ's 2023 report found that \"the systemic problems in MPD made what happened to [Floyd] possible,\" and such problems had continued despite reform efforts.\n\n\"We also found that MPD officers routinely disregard the safety of people in their custody. Our review found numerous incidents in which MPD officers responded to a person saying that they could not breathe with a version of, 'You can breathe, you're talking right now,'\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nGarland cited a case from 2017 during which an MPD officer shot and killed an unarmed woman who he said had \"spooked him\" when she approached his squad car.\n\n\"The woman had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in a nearby alley,\" he said.\n\nMPD officers were also found to stop, search and use force against people who are Black and Native American at disproportionate rates, according to the report.\n\nMPD is already under a consent decree from the state to \"make transformational changes to address race-based policing,\" following a 2023 agreement between the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and the City of Minneapolis.\n\nThe human rights agency described the consent decree as \"a court-enforceable agreement that identifies specific changes to be made and timelines for those changes to occur.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights similarly found that the Minneapolis Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act. This led to a state consent decree agreement that is ongoing.\n\nThe decree still needs to go through other levels of approval, including the mayor's office, before it is filed in federal court, according to Council President Elliott Payne.\n\n\"On behalf of the council and the entire city, I'd like to thank our community for standing together united in this and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very long and challenging journey,\" said Payne. \"We are just beginning and we know we have a long way to go.\"\n\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The global impact of George Floyd: How Black Lives Matter protests shaped movements around the world\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 4, 2021 / 7:39 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nGeorge Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked the largest racial justice protests in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement. But the movement went far beyond this nation's borders - it inspired a global reckoning with racism.\n\nThis time last year, countries across the globe had some of the largest Black Lives Matter protests in their history, all inspired by the video of Floyd brutal death in police custody on May 25, 2020. Crossing continents and cultures, Black activists saw Floyd's death as a symbol of the intolerance and injustice they face at home.\n\nSome of these countries had their own George Floyd - a Black person whose death by police brutality or racial violence created national outrage. Everywhere, activists knew there was no going back to the way things were before they witnessed Floyd's final moments.\n\nPresident Biden said that when he met with Floyd's young daughter Gianna, she told him, \"Daddy changed the world.\" These worldwide protests show how right she was.\n\nThe United Kingdom had the largest Black Lives Matter protests in the world last summer outside of the United States. Even before George Floyd, protesters were already galvanized by a death in their own country.\n\nBelly Mujinga, a Black transport worker in London, died from COVID-19 in April 2020 after saying that a White man spit on her in a racist attack at work. Coworkers said Mujinga had complained before the incident about not having proper protection while working during the pandemic.\n\nPolice closed the case, citing a lack of evidence, which mobilized a first wave of protests. Floyd's death fueled this into a larger movement confronting the country's historical and systemic racism.\n\n\"England is not an overtly racist country, in my humble opinion,\" Imarn Ayton, an organizer of the London protests, told CBS News at the time. \"It is a covertly racist country. So we are much more subtle and polite with our racism.\"\n\nBut the time to be polite was over.\n\nProtesters and police clashed at some of the demonstrations. Some protesters tore down and vandalized statues of slave traders and political leaders - even some who were considered national heroes. A statue of Winston Churchill in London's Parliament Square was spray-painted with a message calling him a \"racist.\"\n\nWithin days, London's protests exploded from about 20 people outside the U.S. embassy to more than 20,000 people flooding the streets. Celebrities joined, including Madonna and John Boyega, who gave an impassioned address to protesters.\n\nMonths after the protests, the government commissioned a report examining institutional racism in the U.K. But its release in March 2021 stunned activists because it simply rejected their claims of systemic problems.\n\n\"Put simply we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities,\" the report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said.\n\n\"Too often 'racism' is the catch-all explanation, and can be simply implicitly accepted rather than explicitly examined.\"\n\nThat same month, Parliament introduced a bill that would give police greater power to restrict protests. Ironically, it inspired a new round of protests with the rallying cry \"Kill The Bill,\" that also called attention to the problem of violence against women .\n\n\"We have taken one step forward and about five steps back since the BLM movement in the U.K.,\" Ayton said.\n\n\"Seeing Black and White people galvanized, standing against racism, scared the living daylights out of the government, out of the Metropolitan Police, out of a lot of people. I think it's purely due to the fact that there was a huge shift in power in that moment.\"\n\nTHE GLOBAL IMPACT OF GEORGE FLOYD: This time last year, the United Kingdom saw the largest #BlackLivesMatter protests in the world outside of the U.S. Activists say England has more covert racism than the United States - but they are still fighting many of the same issues. pic.twitter.com/w7HLvl4Caf\n\nNew Zealand has a global reputation for peace and tolerance. But Black Lives Matter protesters there say that comes from a reluctance to speak directly about race and discrimination. George Floyd finally started those conversations.\n\n\"New Zealand's probably one of the most difficult places to be Black in this world,\" Guled Mire, an organizer for the protesters in the capital city, Wellington, told CBS News. \"Imagine you are Black, but you're not allowed to be Black. That's literally how it is over there.\"\n\nProtests coincided with New Zealand conducting a trial run of arming its police officers - something not routinely done there. The experiment was a response to the 2019 mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch , which were committed by a white supremacist . But Black and Indigenous populations worried that armed police would only put them in danger.\n\n\"We addressed the prime minister directly and the government and we said, 'We're not gonna stand for this, and we oppose this,'\" said Mazou Q, a rapper who helped organize protests in Auckland. \"Because we don't want to end up like the United States.\"\n\nThe government announced days after the first protests that it would scrap plans to arm police, though it did not credit the protests for influencing that decision.\n\nPeople of African descent compromise less than 1% of New Zealand's population. But the protests brought Black protesters together with Indigenous Māori and Pacific Islanders, creating a movement for racial progress unlike anything the country had seen for years. One protest in Wellington drew more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"The kind of escapism that we indulged in in the past wouldn't suffice anymore,\" Mazbou Q said. \"We had to reckon with what was happening, and we had to take a side...There was no more status quo as an option.\"\n\nNew Zealand has a global reputation for peace and tolerance. But George Floyd's death last summer moved Black activists to speak up about problems they say the country is \"in complete denial\" about. pic.twitter.com/cqsQHDEwXB\n\nIn France, protesters rallied against their nation's own history of racial injustice and police brutality, which has very different roots from the U.S.\n\nIn 1960, 17 sub-Saharan African nations, including 14 former French colonies, gained independence from their former European colonists. Today, many of the Black people living in France emigrated from those colonies.\n\nWith an eye on the United States, children of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean are bringing race into the French public discourse.\n\n\"There is this refusal to take into account the history of slavery and colonization, and how race was part of it and how we're still dealing with the legacy,\" said Nathalie Etoke, an associate professor of Francophone and Africana Studies at the City University of New York Graduate Center.\n\nThe thousands of protesters in Paris were joined by the family of Adama Traore, who died on his 24th birthday in 2016 under circumstances similar to Floyd. Three police officers put their weight on him to restrain him, and he could not be revived after being brought to a police station. There were no charges for his death.\n\n\"We're demanding acts of justice, not discussions,\" Adama's sister Assa Traore said in a press conference last June, as protests continued into their second week. \"We'll protest in the streets every week if necessary.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. But thousands of miles away in France, his death sparked unprecedented protests against anti-Black violence - the roots of which are far different than the United States, but the experience of which is all too familiar. pic.twitter.com/qn6cnSwvQr\n\nIn Colombia, the news of Floyd's death was bookended by two notorious police killings domestically.\n\nOn May 22, 2020 - just three days before Floyd's killing - a young Black man named Anderson Arboleda was beaten to death by police for allegedly violating coronavirus curfew restrictions. Protesters soon marched to the U.S. embassy in Bogota, moved by the deaths of both Arboleda and Floyd.\n\nThen on September 9, 46-year-old Javier Ordóñez died after being brutalized in police custody - which was caught on video. In the footage, Ordóñez is heard saying \"I am choking\" and \"Enough, no more, please\" as officers kneel on him and use stun guns on him.\n\nThe deaths set off months of protests, some of which ended in violent and even deadly police crackdowns. During recent protests in Colombia over inequality and police brutality, local activist groups say at least 43 people have been killed by police. More than 2,900 cases of police brutality have also been reported.\n\nActivists say the cases of Floyd and Ordóñez inspired people to record incidents with police. And protesters say that even the threat of death isn't stopping them from continuing to challenge police violence and systemic brutality.\n\n\"A lot of people tell me, 'Yolanda, don't risk your life by marching in the streets knowing it can put you at risk,'\" said Yolanda Perea, a human rights defender in Chocó. \"But I'll continue to march and defend our lives. Because if we don't unite to defend life, they will continue to crush us more every day.\"\n\nIn Colombia, where police brutality has notoriously been a problem, George Floyd's death added fuel to the fire, sparking #BlackLivesMatter protests and inspiring citizens to film confrontations with police. pic.twitter.com/NrElZrlfvu\n\nAs the summer of protests blazed through the U.S., Washington, D.C. became a national center for the Black Lives Matter movement. The city created Black Lives Matter Plaza , near the White House, less than two weeks after Floyd's death, and it is now a regular gathering space for protest and activism.\n\nWashington was also the site of the nation's most notorious crackdown on protesters. On June 1, law enforcement used tear gas and riot control tactics to push peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so that then-President Trump could cross the cleared-out street and pose in front of the vandalized St. John's Church, holding a Bible.\n\nThe photo-op and use of force drew condemnation from military officials and even some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who believed it crossed a line.\n\nOn August 28, thousands gathered for the 2020 March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial, with George Floyd's brother Philonise addressing the crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Black Lives Matter chapter started mutual aid initiatives in all eight wards of the city to work to bring about some of the changes that they've yet to see from institutions.\n\n\"We have built a stronger community and reimagined a world where we keep us safe and we can build a world without police,\" Neenee Taylor, the former mass engagement and rapid response coordinator for Black Lives Matter D.C., told CBS News. \"And so that's what has changed for our community since George Floyd in D.C. But as far as the government - hasn't nothing changed.\"\n\nLast summer, in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, Washington D.C. became a focal point for the country's #BlackLivesMatter protests - inspiring a new, younger generation of activists in the process. pic.twitter.com/ZORecd3DcY\n\nJason Silverstein is the supervising politics producer for the CBS News social media team, working with teams in New York and Washington, D.C. to oversee coverage of national politics and the 2024 campaign.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

It's the first time the words will not be stenciled in at least one of the end zones since Feb. 2021. Mike Silver, national columnist at The Athletic, joins \"America Decides\" to discuss.\n\nSince George Floyd's 2020 murder, the Minneapolis Police Department has spent at least $2.5 million on training and recruitment, but some community members say that has not translated to trust.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, the city has made drastic changes, including shifting funding from its police department into other services and investing in training and recruitment. Ash-har Quraishi examines the changes and how they have been viewed by the community.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has faced criticism for his response to the public unrest in his state after George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020. CBS News Confirmed mapped out how long it took Walz to bring in the National Guard during the outrage. CBS News Minnesota reporter Jennifer Mayerle explains the findings.\n\nOne of the two vice presidential candidates taking the debate stage Tuesday night was largely unknown to voters outside of Minnesota before joining the Democratic ticket. But even since then, many Americans might still be wondering: Who is Gov. Tim Walz? CBS News Minnesota reporter and anchor Esme Murphy explains.\n\nThe ex-Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing George Floyd has been transferred to a federal prison in Texas almost nine months after he was stabbed in a different facility.\n\nOne of the former Minneapolis police officers convicted in the murder of George Floyd has been released from custody, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nAudio from 2020 has been uncovered where former President Donald Trump praises Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for his handling of the unrest in Minneapolis following George Floyd's murder. Trump and other Republicans have criticized Walz about the riots since he became Kamala Harris' running mate, accusing him of inaction. CBS News campaign reporter Jake Rosen has more.\n\nIn the call, then-President Donald Trump said of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, \"He's an excellent guy.\"\n\nLinda Tirado was in Minneapolis from out of state covering the protests and rioting when police shot her in the face with a rubber bullet, also known as a \"less-lethal\" round.\n\nFour years after George Floyd's murder, work on federal police reform legislation has halted almost entirely amid a partisan stall on Capitol Hill.\n\nFour years after George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, momentum in Washington to pass sweeping reform in the Minnesota man's name has almost faded away completely. Taurean Small explains.\n\nFour years ago, George Floyd was murdered by then-officer Derek Chauvin. The images are for many seared into memory, never to be dislodged. However, at a Twin Cities teen summit this week, young people worked to meet the challenge of moving forward.\n\nSaturday marks four years since the murder of George Floyd. Since then partisan disagreements in Washington, D.C., have stalled efforts to pass national police reform legislation. CBS News campaign reporter Taurean Small has more from Minneapolis.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara says his department is short more than 200 officers, one of many cities facing officer shortages nationwide. But in Minneapolis, the hurdle is more than just manpower, it is trust too, nearly four years after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Scott MacFarlane has more.\n\nToday's pro-Palestinian protests have prompted some to compare them to campus protests in the 1960s. CBS News executive director of elections and surveys Anthony Salvanto digs into the archives to explain how Americans viewed the Vietnam War protest movement at the time.\n\nNearly a dozen Minneapolis police officers were suspended, fired or received other reprimands for alleged misconduct during the unrest that followed George Floyd's murder in 2020, newly released documents show.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office identified the alleged perpetrator as 52-year-old John Turscak. He now faces charges of attempted murder, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, and assault resulting in serious bodily injury.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder in the 2020 killing of George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate in a federal prison in Arizona, CBS News learned. Minnesota's attorney general said Chauvin is expected to survive his injuries.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate Friday at a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nThe agreement requires the nation's largest police department to deploy fewer officers to most public protests.\n\nTou Thao, the last former Minneapolis police officer convicted in state court for his role in the killing of George Floyd, was sentenced Monday to four years and nine months - even as he denied wrongdoing.\n\nNoah Gragson was suspended indefinitely after liking a racially insensitive meme with a photo of George Floyd's face.\n\nAn attorney for the former Minneapolis police officer said they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review Chauvin's second-degree murder conviction.\n\nA two-year Department of Justice investigation sparked after the murder of George Floyd has found the City of Minneapolis and its police department engage in practices that deprives residents - specifically Black and Native American residents - of their rights.\n\nThe funeral service for Pope Francis took place Saturday morning at the Vatican. Watch the full ceremony.\n\nPope Francis requested simplicity in his wooden coffin and final resting place, but his funeral Mass still reflected the grandeur and traditions of the Vatican.\n\nPresident Trump and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy met privately ahead of the funeral of Pope Francis, the White House said.\n\nThe talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn an order, a federal judge wrote there was a \"strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.\"\n\nU.S. officials say the wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a security check.\n\nThe blast happened at the Rajaei port just outside of Bandar Abbas, a major shipping site in Iran.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, who spoke out against Jeffrey Epstein and Britain's Prince Andrew, \"was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking,\" her family said.\n\nThe shooting occurred just outside Augusta, Georgia, during a traffic stop, authorities said.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin appeals murder conviction for killing George Floyd\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nApril 28, 2022 / 4:34 PM EDT / AP\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is appealing his conviction for murder in the killing of George Floyd , arguing that jurors were intimidated by the protests that followed and prejudiced by heavy pretrial publicity. Chauvin asked the Minnesota Court of Appeals in a court filing Monday to reverse his conviction, reverse and remand for a new trial in a new venue, or order a re-sentencing.\n\nLast June, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22 1/2 years in prison after jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFloyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin pinned the Black man to the ground with his knee on his neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. Floyd had been accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. Three other fired officers face state trial this summer after being convicted in federal court earlier this year of violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nChauvin's attorney, William Mohrman, laid out a number of challenges to his conviction, including that the trial should not have been held in Hennepin County, where Floyd was killed.\n\n\"The overwhelming media coverage exposed the jurors - literally every day - to news demonizing Chauvin and glorifying Floyd which was more than sufficient to presume prejudice,\" the brief said.\n\nIn the months that followed Floyd's killing, protesters took to the streets in Minneapolis and around the country to protest police brutality and racism . Some of that unrest was violent.\n\nMohrman said several potential jurors expressed concerns during jury selection that if Chauvin was acquitted they would fear for their personal safety and worried about more violence. He said several of them said they were intimidated by the security measures implemented at the courthouse to protect trial participants from protesters.\n\nThe filing also cited the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright by a police officer in nearby Brooklyn Center that sparked more protests during Chauvin's trial. It says jurors should have been sequestered after selection to avoid being prejudiced by reports of that slaying. It also cited a $27 million settlement reached between the city and Floyd's family that was announced during jury selection, saying the timing of that prejudiced jurors in the case.\n\nMohrman cited several instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, claiming untimely sharing of evidence, failure to disclose and document dumping by the government.\n\nThe filing also says the judge did not apply the sentencing guidelines correctly and should not have included \"abuse of a position of authority\" as an aggravating sentencing factor for the former police officer.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has 45 days to respond to Chauvin's brief.\n\nThe appeal came as the Minnesota Department of Human Rights released the results of a nearly two-year investigation launched after Floyd's slaying. It found the Minneapolis Police Department has engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade , including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people, using force more often on people of color and maintaining a culture where racist language is tolerated.\n\n© 2022 The Associated Press.

While being arrested, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. The video shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop. He was pronounced dead shortly after.\n\nThat officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested on Friday and first charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The new second-degree murder charge says that Chauvin killed Floyd \"without intent\" in the course of committing assault in the third degree, according to an amended complaint.\n\nThomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who stood near the others, were not initially charged. Lane, 37, Kueng, 26, and Thao, 34, are now charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFloyd grew up in Houston's Third Ward neighborhood and graduated from Jack Yates High School where he played football and basketball, according to CNN affiliate KPRC .\n\nAfter high school, head basketball coach George Walker recruited Floyd to play for him at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida. Floyd was a student there from 1993 to 1995, Walker told CNN.\n\n\"He didn't give me too much trouble as a basketball coach,\" Walker said. \"He was a pretty good athlete, averaged 12 to 14 points a game.\"\n\nFloyd was a coachable kid with a big heart, according to Walker's wife, Gloria.\n\nOf all the college athletes on the school's team, she said Floyd had her attention the most \"because he was just a fun person to be around.\"\n\n\"He was never one that tried to blame others for his own mistakes,\" she said. \"He always owned up to them and always tried to do better.\"\n\nHe moved to Minnesota for work and to drive trucks, according to friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson.\n\nJackson, a Houston native also, calls Floyd his twin.\n\n\"I've heard George in the last couple days more than I've heard my whole life, and we had a 21-plus (year) relationship,\" Jackson told CNN's Poppy Harlow Thursday. \"His name was always Floyd, my twin.\"\n\nA post shared by Stephen Jackson (@_stak5_)\n\nFloyd was known in the community as a protector and a provider who didn't have a hateful bone in his body, according to Jackson. He got along with everybody and seldom wanted anything in return for helping someone out, Jackson said.\n\n\"The difference between me and bro was I had more opportunity than he did,\" wrote Jackson, who won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. \"2 things we have in common both from the bottom and both of our names will live forever.\"\n\nOnce Floyd moved to Minnesota, Jackson said Floyd talked at great length about his journey to create better opportunities for himself.\n\nRelated article Minneapolis ex-officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck is in custody and charged with murder\n\n\"The last time i talked to him was about a year ago and every conversation we had in that year was about bettering ourselves and being better fathers,\" Jackson said. \"That's all he talked about.\"\n\nFloyd is a father to two daughters, the youngest is 6, according to Jackson.\n\n\"I want justice for his kids,\" he said. \"I want his kids to be taken care of.

      "text": "Seeking justice\n\nBy Amir Vera and Daniel Wolfe, CNN\n\nJason Armond/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nItâs been days since George Floyd took his last breaths with a knee on his neck. Since then, protestors have marched and clashed with police, politicians and local leaders have made promises to hurting communities and America has had to come to terms with generational inequities that have left many Black and brown people at a disadvantage to their White counterparts.\n\nThe highly publicized trial of Derek Chauvin resulted in the jury finding Chauvin guilty on all charges, a conviction that reverberated through the country and across the world. In June 2021, a judge sentenced Chauvin to 22 and half years in prison.\n\nHereâs everything that led to the sentencing.\n\nIn the week between May 25 and June 1, 2020, a video of Floydâs death went viral and protests erupted across the US.\n\nFloyd is killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while an officer kneels on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd tells officers âI canât breatheâ and calls out for his mother repeatedly before becoming unresponsive . Chauvin continues to hold his knee on Floydâs neck for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after .  Officers initially responded to reports of forgery in progress. Floyd was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit $20.\n\nProsecutors clarified the time Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck during their opening statements for Chauvin's trial on March 29, 2021, saying the former officer knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nThe four Minneapolis officers involved in Floydâs death are fired. The officers involved in the incident were identified by Minneapolis police as: Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, according to the police website.\n\nProtests begin in Minneapolis as demonstrators clash with police .

He was also later charged with second-degree murder .\n\nExperts hired by Floyd's family and the Hennepin County Medical Examiner conclude his death was a homicide , but they differ on what caused it.\n\nAs the world awaited more information regarding Floydâs death, videos from the body cameras of the officers at the scene painted a picture of escalated panic from officers, bystanders and Floyd himself during the May 25 arrest.\n\nThe other three officers in Floydâs killing â Lane, Kueng and Thao â are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\n\nMinneapolis City Council approves restraining order against police , meaning the use of chokeholds by police is banned and also requires police to report and intervene if the banned practice is used.\n\nFloyd is buried next to his mother in his native Houston. The same day, a Hennepin County judge approved the restraining order to ban chokeholds by police officers.\n\nThe Daily Mail, based in London, obtains footage of the body cameras worn by two of the former Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest of Floyd. The footage is released and shows a panicked Floyd struggling with officers while in the back of a squad car in the minutes before his death, saying, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nPolice body camera footage showing Minneapolis police pointing a gun at Floyd and struggling with him during his fatal arrest is released by Hennepin County Court.\n\nThe footage, roughly an hour in length, comes from the body cameras of former officers Lane and Kueng, who were the first to respond to a store where Floyd was accused of passing a fake $20 bill.\n\nBody camera video from former officer Thao is released by Hennepin County Court. The video shows a crowd of bystanders becoming increasingly upset as police hold down Floyd, pleading with officers to get off of him and check his pulse.\n\nA video interview with former officer Thao is released and shows him telling federal investigators the call for backup on May 25 sounded âlike it was urgent.â\n\nChauvin is granted bail and a judge allows him to leave the state for his safety during this period. Protesters and activists alike are angered by these developments and take to the streets again.\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Chauvin asks a judge to dismiss murder charges against him in the death of George Floyd.\n\nA little over 100 days since Floyd died , protests are still raging across the US.\n\nMinneapolis City Council unanimously votes to rename a street after George Floyd.\n\nChauvin posts bond on $1 million bail. Protesters take to the streets of Minneapolis to express outrage of Chauvinâs release.\n\nThe Hennepin County Court posts on its website saying Chauvin will be allowed to leave Minnesota and live in a neighboring state due to safety concerns stemming from his involvement in Floydâs death.\n\nCahill drops a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, but denies his attorneyâs motion to dismiss two other charges. Cahill also denied motions to dismiss charges against the other three officers.\n\nWill the four ex-cops be tried together? Who are the jurors? Will Chauvin face a third-degree murder charge? Officials have had to deliberate over these questions before any trial could begin.\n\nCahill rules the ex-cops in Floydâs death will be tried at the same time in the county on March 8. Cahill also rejected a defense attorneyâs request for a change of venue in the trial of the four former officers.\n\nThe Minnesota District Court files a 16-page questionnaire asking prospective jurors to answer how many times they have seen the video of Floydâs death, their prior interactions with police and their views on defunding the police and racial discrimination.\n\nCahill rules Chauvin will be tried separately from the other three officers because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nJury selection in Chauvin's trial will take place March 8 to 26, according to the ruling. Opening statements will begin \"no earlier than March 29,\" the judge wrote.\n\nThe other officers will be tried together starting on August 23.\n\nJudge Cahill reinstates the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin after a Minnesota Court of Appeals ordered Cahill to reconsider the motion.\n\nA jury of 15 people is selected for Chauvinâs trial. It takes two weeks to select the jurors, nine of whom are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to how the court says the jurors identified themselves.\n\nDerek Chauvin was found guilty on all charges in the death of George Floyd, including second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The jury deliberated for more than 10 hours over the course of two days.\n\nEric Nelson, Chauvin's attorney, filed a motion for a new trial in which he outlined alleged mistakes made by Judge Peter Cahill, state prosecutors and the he claims jury that violated Chauvin's constitutional rights to a due process and a fair trial.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22 and half years in prison . Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will have to serve two-thirds of his sentence, or 15 years, and he will be eligible for supervised release for the remaining seven and a half years."

      "text": "Former officer knelt on George Floyd for 9 minutes and 29 seconds - not the infamous 8:46\n\nFormer Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd for 9 minutes and 29 seconds , prosecutors said Monday, correcting the 8:46 timing that has become a symbol of police brutality.\n\nIn opening statements of Chauvin's criminal trial, prosecuting attorney Jerry Blackwell repeatedly emphasized the new 9:29 timing, telling jurors they were the \"three most important numbers in this case.\"\n\nHe broke down the timing of Chauvin's kneeling into three sections: 4 minutes and 45 seconds as Floyd cried out for help, 53 seconds as Floyd flailed due to seizures and 3 minutes and 51 seconds as Floyd was non-responsive.\n\nChauvin's defense similarly accepted the new timing as accurate to support its own arguments.\n\nRelated article Derek Chauvin's trial in death of George Floyd begins\n\n\"The evidence is far greater than 9 minutes and 29 seconds,\" attorney Eric Nelson said in his opening, noting the many interviews and documents that he said would prove Chauvin is not guilty.\n\nThe 43-second difference between 8:46 and 9:29 has little impact on the case itself, but the 8:46 number had taken on a power of its own since Floyd died under Chauvin's knee on May 25, 2020.\n\nProtesters, including Democratic members of Congress, have held moments of silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, kneelings and \"die-ins.\" Comedian Dave Chappelle released a standup special about police violence and anti-Black racism titled simply \" 8:46 .\" The number even has its own Wikipedia page .\n\nAnd just minutes before the trial began Monday, members of Floyd's family and allies, including Rev. Al Sharpton and attorney Benjamin Crump, went down on one knee for 8:46 to commemorate his death.\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office has now corrected that timing several times.\n\nThe 8:46 timing initially was included in a criminal complaint against Chauvin .\n\nThat number was based on bystander video of Floyd's death that went viral and led to public outrage. The video, which is over 10 minutes long in all, begins with Chauvin already on Floyd's neck, so it was not immediately clear how long he had been on Floyd prior to the video's start.\n\nIn June, weeks after the initial complaint, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office told CNN that Chauvin actually had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes and 46 seconds .\n\n\"These kinds of technical matters can be handled in future amendments to the criminal complaint if other reasons make it necessary to amend the complaint between now and any trials,\" the county said in a statement, adding the error \"made no difference\" in the decision to charge the former officer.\n\nEvidence from the officers' body cameras released in later months led to the the timing of over 9 minutes.\n\nCNN's Josh Campbell, Julia Jones and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Derek Chauvin found guilty of all three charges for killing George Floyd\n\nThe former Minneapolis Police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck for more than 9 minutes last year was found guilty Tuesday of all three charges against him in one of the most consequential trials of the Black Lives Matter era.\n\nDerek Chauvin, 45, was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The jurors deliberated for more than 10 hours over two days before coming to their decision.\n\nWearing a mask inside the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Chauvin had no apparent reaction to the guilty verdict. Afterward, his bail was revoked and he was placed in handcuffs and removed from the court through a side door.\n\nHe was taken to a facility in Stillwater, Minnesota, about 25 miles east of downtown Minneapolis, officials said.\n\nThe second-degree murder charge said Chauvin assaulted Floyd with his knee, which unintentionally caused Floyd's death. The third-degree murder charge said Chauvin acted with a \"depraved mind,\" and the manslaughter charge said his \"culpable negligence\" caused Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder and up to 10 years for manslaughter. Minnesota's sentencing guidelines recommend about 12.5 years in prison for each murder charge and about four years for the manslaughter charge. In this case, the state has asked for a tougher sentence than the recommendations provide. Chauvin's sentencing is set for eight weeks from now.\n\nThe verdict comes about 11 months after bystander video showed Chauvin impassively kneeling on the neck and back of Floyd, handcuffed and lying prone on the street, for 9 minutes and 29 seconds on May 25, 2020. Under the officer's knees, the 46-year-old Black man gasped for air, repeatedly exclaimed \"I can't breathe\" and ultimately went silent.\n\nHis final moments illustrated in clear visuals what Black Americans have long said about the ways that the criminal justice system dehumanizes Black people, setting off mass protests across the country as well as incidents of looting and unrest.\n\nRelated article The charges against Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd, explained\n\nInside court, Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's younger brother, clasped his hands over his head in prayer as the verdicts were read, according to pool reporters, including CNN's Josh Campbell. During the third guilty verdict, his hands shook back and forth and he kept his head down and eyes closed as his head nodded up and down, the report said.\n\nAfter court concluded, Philonise Floyd was seen crying as he hugged all four prosecutors.\n\n\"I was just praying they would find him guilty,\" he explained. \"As an African American, we usually never get justice.\"\n\nIn the streets of Minneapolis, the verdicts led to cries of joy and sighs of relief among those nervously watching the trial, including many people outside the Cup Foods store where Floyd took his final breaths.\n\nHundreds of people remained in what is now called George Floyd Square as night approached.\n\nOver about three weeks of testimony in court, Minnesota prosecutors repeatedly told jurors to \"believe your eyes\" and rely on that video.\n\n\"This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video. It is exactly that. You can believe your eyes,\" prosecuting attorney Steve Schleicher said in closing arguments. \"This wasn't policing. This was murder.\"\n\nThe defense called seven witnesses - but not Chauvin himself, as he invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify . Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that Chauvin's use of force was reasonable, that he was distracted by hostile bystanders and that Floyd died of other causes.\n\nIn a first for Minnesota, the trial was broadcast live in its entirety to accommodate Covid-19 attendance restrictions, giving the public a rare look into the heart of the legal system.\n\nTensions have been high throughout the Twin Cities region , and authorities ramped up security in anticipation of a verdict. The Hennepin County Government Center has been surrounded by fencing and barricades since jury selection began in March. More than 3,000 Minnesota National Guard members have also been activated in the Twin Cities, while businesses in Minneapolis have boarded up windows.\n\nBut the all-guilty verdict rapidly alleviated those fears.\n\nThe Floyd family, the Rev. Al Sharpton, attorney Ben Crump and other close allies called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in a post-verdict news conference that was in turns triumphant, joyous, relieved and solemn.\n\n\"We frame this moment for all of us, not just George Floyd,\" Crump said. \"This is a victory for those who champion humanity over inhumanity, those who champion justice over injustice, those who champion morals over immorality.\"\n\nFor Philonise Floyd, who testified about his brother at the trial , the verdict was personal.\n\n\"I feel relieved today that I finally have the opportunity for, hopefully, getting some sleep,\" he said. \"A lot of days that I prayed and I hoped and I was speaking everything into existence. I said I have faith that he will be convicted.\"\n\nAfter the verdict, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke on the phone with the Floyd family and their attorneys, according to video posted by Crump.\n\n\"Nothing is going to make it all better,\" Biden told them, but \"at least now there's some justice.\"\n\nBiden, in addressing the nation later, said , \"Nothing can ever bring their brother or their father back. But this can be a giant step forward in the march towards justice in America.\"\n\nThe President said that in order for their to be real change, lawmakers must help ensure a tragedy like this cannot happen and that people of color no longer fear being stopped by police.\n\nRelated article Minnesota's Twin Cities are once again the national flashpoint over race and policing\n\nHe said he told the Floyd family \"we're going to continue to fight for the passage of George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so I can sign it into law as quickly as possible. There is more to do. Finally it is the work we do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies. That's the work we have to do.\"\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office prosecuted the case, cautioned that the verdicts were not the end of the road.\n\n\"I would not call today's verdict justice, however, because justice implies true restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step toward justice,\" he said.\n\nThe nation's largest police union, the National Fraternal Order of Police, also praised the trial as fair.\n\n\"Our system of justice has worked as it should, with the prosecutors and defense presenting their evidence to the jury, which then deliberated and delivered a verdict,\" the statement read. \"The trial was fair and due process was served. We hope and expect that all of our fellow citizens will respect the rule of law and remain peaceful tonight and in the days to come.\"\n\nProsecutors called 38 witnesses over the course of three separate phases of the trial.\n\nFirst, bystanders at the scene testified about their fear and horror as they watched Floyd slowly die under Chauvin's restraint. Next, a series of police supervisors and use-of-force experts - including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo - criticized Chauvin's continued kneeling as excessive and unreasonable, particularly after Floyd had passed out, stopped breathing and had no pulse.\n\nFinally, five separate medical experts explained that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen when Chauvin restricted his ability to breathe in what's known as \"positional asphyxia.\"\n\nIn the state's closing argument, Schleicher said Chauvin knelt on Floyd for so long because of his pride and his ego in the face of concerned bystanders.\n\nRelated article Closing arguments offer colliding views of Derek Chauvin's role in George Floyd's death\n\n\"He was not going to let these bystanders tell him what to do. He was going to do what he wanted, how he wanted, for as long as he wanted. And there was nothing, nothing they can do about it because he had the authority. He had the power, and the other officers, the bystanders were powerless,\" he said. \"He was trying to win, and George Floyd paid for it with his life.\"\n\nHe contrasted Chauvin's \"ego-based pride\" with the proper feelings of pride in wearing a police badge and praised policing as a noble profession. He insisted the state was prosecuting Chauvin individually - not policing in general.\n\n\"This is not an anti-police prosecution; it is a pro-police prosecution,\" he said. \"There is nothing worse for good police than bad police.\"\n\nIn response, Nelson said Chauvin acted as a \"reasonable officer\" would in that situation and said there was no evidence he intentionally or purposefully used force that was unlawful.\n\n\"You have to take into account that officers are human beings, capable of making mistakes in highly stressful situations,\" Nelson said. \"In this case, the totality of the circumstances that were known to a reasonable police officer in the precise moment the force was used demonstrates that this was an authorized use of force, as unattractive as it may be. This is reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe three other former officers on scene - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They have pleaded not guilty, and their joint trial will be held this summer.\n\nCNN's Aaron Cooper reported from Minneapolis and Eric Levenson wrote and reported from New York.

      "text": "A former Minneapolis police officer said Derek Chauvin violated protocol kneeling on George Floyd's neck, but he doesn't think the officer committed a crime\n\nA former Minneapolis police officer told Insider that Derek Chauvin violated protocol while kneeling on George Floyd's neck for several minutes last year but that he didn't think the officer's actions led to Floyd's death.\n\nThe former officer, who spoke with Insider on the condition of anonymity, left the department days before Chauvin's trial started on March 29. The former officer's identity is known to Insider.\n\nThe former officer said he believed that Chauvin couldn't get a fair trial in Minneapolis and that the trial should have been moved elsewhere.\n\nHe said he also didn't buy Chauvin's claim that he was following departmental procedure during the arrest. That sentiment was echoed at the trial, where Chief Medaria Arradondo of the Minneapolis Police Department testified that Chauvin's hold on Floyd was not part of the department's training .\n\n\"I was a use-of-force instructor,\" the former officer told Insider. \"I never taught the officers to kneel on anybody's neck.\"\n\nHe added: \"We were told to put the knee on shoulders, on the top of the back, but never on their neck. It's just not a good thing to do.\"\n\nBut the former officer also said that he didn't believe Chauvin's hold caused Floyd's death and that Chauvin should not be convicted of the charges against him. Chauvin is being tried on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe former officer said he believed Floyd died of a drug overdose , citing the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy report .\n\nThat report concluded that Floyd's death was a homicide but listed the cause of death as a \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\" - which meant Floyd's heart stopped as he was being restrained.\n\nThe autopsy also showed that Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system. Fentanyl is a super-strong synthetic opioid , and researchers say just 3 milligrams of it is enough to kill an average-size man.\n\nThe key challenge of the case is convincing the jury what caused Floyd's heart to stop: Chauvin's kneeling on Floyd's neck, as the prosecution argues , or a combination of a heart issue and drugs, as the defense argues.\n\n\"I've seen overdoses before, and what I saw was basically George Floyd dying of an overdose,\" the former officer said, referring to bystander videos of Floyd's arrest. \"That's what it appears like to me.\"\n\nAt Chauvin's trial on Monday, a cardiologist testified that Floyd did not die of a heart attack or a drug overdose, but from a \"cardio pulmonary arrest\" caused by the \"position that he was subjected to.\"\n\nAn independent autopsy paid for by Floyd's family and released last June differed from the official report, saying the cause of death was mechanical asphyxiation - strangulation as a result of compressing the neck.\n\nThe former officer said that while he believed that Chauvin didn't cause Floyd's death, he still thought the jury could end up convicting Chauvin.\n\n\"I think the world is looking for blood right now, looking for justice for George Floyd,\" the former officer said.\n\nHe told Insider he also believed that the trial, no matter the outcome, could lead to violent protests in the city.\n\n\"That's why I left,\" he said. \"I'm not going to get myself killed or injured before I retired.\"\n\nIn fact, protests once again flared in Minneapolis on Sunday night following the news that a 20-year-old Black man had shot dead by a police officer during a traffic stop.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, a Minneapolis city spokesman told Insider he was \"unable to discuss any aspects of the trial or case\" because of a judicial mandate. The city now handles the police department's press inquiries after the city council voted to do away with the department's public-information officer after Floyd's death.\n\nJump to"

Bravinder, told jurors on day four of Chauvin's trial.\n\n\"In lay terms, I thought he was dead,\" Smith said of Floyd's condition when he arrived. \"In a living person, you should feel a pulse.\"\n\nSmith was one of several first responders prosecutors called Thursday who were at the scene when Floyd died, after Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes.\n\nThe paramedics testified Floyd was no longer breathing on his own by the time he was taken into their ambulance. Despite their care, his pulse never returned.\n\nMinneapolis Police Sgt. David Pleoger, who worked as Chauvin's supervisor and oversees use of force reports,  testified that he viewed the body camera footage and believed Chauvin could have stopped his use of force on Floyd when he was handcuffed and on the ground.\n\nHe said he received a call from a 911 dispatcher on May 25. The dispatcher, who testified Monday, told Pleoger that she saw live footage of officers using force on a man outside Cup Foods.\n\nIn response, Pleoger called Chauvin to see what was happening. During that call, Chauvin told him they had tried to put Floyd in a cruiser but he became combative. Chauvin then told his supervisor that Floyd suffered a medical emergency during a struggle and an ambulance was called - not mentioning that he used force on Floyd while restraining him, Pleoger testified.\n\nPleoger went to the scene and asked Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Keung to interview witnesses. He, Chauvin, and Officer Tou Thao went to Hennepin County Medical Center, where Floyd was pronounced dead. The incident then was deemed critical and Pleoger handed over the investigation to other administrators.\n\nCourteney Ross reportedly made one man in the jury emotional as she told the court about her nearly three year relationship with Floyd.\n\nThey met when she was having a bad day at the Salvation Army location where Floyd worked, she said, and he approached her to see if she was OK.\n\nWhen she said she wasn't OK, he asked if he could pray with her, Ross testified. As the night went on, he asked for her number and they began dating.\n\nRoss told the court they both struggled with opioid use during their relationship and tried to overcome addiction together. Floyd's opioid use was spurred by an injury to his back, she said, while her struggles began with chronic pain in her neck.\n\nIn March 2020, Floyd was hospitalized from a drug overdose for five days. Ross said they purchased pills that month that looked like pain killers, but gave them each a different kind of high - one that made Ross jittery instead of relaxed.\n\nThen in May, about two weeks before Floyd's death, Ross said she realized he was acting different and assumed he'd started using drugs again.\n\nRoss told the court she believed Floyd sometimes bought drugs from Morries Hall and Shawanda Hill, who were both with him in the car outside Cup Foods.\n\nInvestigators found fragments of pills in the car that tested positive for a mixture of methamphetamine and fentanyl. Those drugs were found in Floyd's system after his death.\n\nHall invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on Wednesday and his attorney asked the prosecution to squash his subpoena to testify.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "What we learned from Day 2 of Derek Chauvin's trial in the killing of George Floyd\n\nGenevieve Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter and EMT, was off-duty on May 25 when she came across the emergency scene where then-officer Derek Chauvin was pressing his knee into the neck of a handcuffed man who was begging for his life.\n\nSeeing the man - now known to have been George Floyd - was in distress, she tried to let officers know who she was and that she was available to help.\n\n\"I identified myself right away because I noticed he needed medical attention,\" Hansen testified during day two of Chauvin's trial. \"I thought his face looked puffy and swollen, which would happen if you're putting a grown man's weight on someones neck.\"\n\nHansen was among six bystanders who testified Tuesday about witnessing Floyd's last moments alive.\n\nMost of them described feeling helpless in their efforts to make sure officers didn't kill Floyd on their watch.\n\nAs bystanders begged for Chauvin to get off of the man - who has since been identified as George Floyd - Hansen noticed that the man's face was swollen and pressed to the ground. His consciousness was altered.\n\nAs time when on and she continued to beg officers at the scene let her check a pulse, or at least for them to do it, she grew more upset because they weren't completing the steps needed to keep him alive.\n\nHansen said she tried to intervene, asking Chauvin and Officer Tou Thao if she could take Floyd's pulse.\n\nThao responded, \"if you really are a Minneapolis firefighter, then you would know better to get involved,\" Hansen said.\n\nHansen testified that she was concerned about Floyd's life when she saw body fluid, that she believed could have been urine - a sign that a patient was dying or had died.\n\n\"I was desperate to help and wasn't getting what I needed to do, I wasn't gaining access,\" she said, in tears.\n\nDarnella Fraizer, who was 17 when Floyd was killed in May 2020, came across the scene when she was walking her little cousin to buy snacks at Cup Foods.\n\nWhen she heard Floyd crying out for help, she sent her 9-year-old cousin inside the store because she didn't want her to see what was happening. Then she started to record it on her phone.\n\nShe told the court she believed Chauvin kneeled harder on Floyd's neck as she continued to record and other bystanders called out for him to stop.\n\nTwo other teenage girls - Alyssa and Kaylynn - also recorded the incident and called out for Chauvin to get off Floyd's neck.\n\nAlyssa had driven Kaylynn to Cup Foods and when both heard a man begging for help when they pulled up to the store.\n\nKaylynn gave Alyssa her phone to document the scene, they both testified.\n\n\"I could hear George basically crying and begging them to get off of him because he was in pain,\" Alyssa said. \"His eyes were starting to roll to the back of his head, saliva was coming out of his mouth.\"\n\n\"I knew time was running out or that it had already, that he was going to die,\" she added.\n\nKaylynn told the jury she remembered calling out to the officers, asking them why they were still on top of Floyd.\n\n\"Hes not doing anything wrong,\" she remembered saying. \"He's handcuffed.\"\n\nAs people called out, though, \"I saw him sort of digging his knee into his neck more,\" she said.\n\nAt one point, she remembers Chauvin pulling mace out and pointing it in the direction of her and the other bystanders.\n\n\"He did grab his mace and started shaking it at us,\" Kaylynn said. \"I didn't know what was going to happen ... I was scared of Chauvin.\"\n\nIn his opening statement, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson tried to paint a picture that the bystanders who surrounded the scene were an unruly group distracting officers from caring for the suspect in their custody.\n\nThose bystanders, however, testified that getting officers to care for Floyd is exactly what they called for.\n\nDonald Williams, a professional martial artist and security guard, testified that he witnessed Chauvin use a \"blood choke\" on Floyd, restricting his breathing.\n\nAfter first observing the scene, Williams started calling out demanding that the Chauvin get off Floyd's neck. As time went on, he began swearing and calling Chauvin names.\n\nHansen, too, said on the stand that she had called Chauvin a bitch.\n\n\"I got quite angry after Mr. Floyd was loaded into the ambulance and there was no point in trying to reason with them anymore because they had just killed somebody,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know if you've seen anyone be killed, but it's upsetting,\" Hansen added later.\n\nNelson asked several of the teenagers whether the crowd was violent or threatening.\n\n\"No,\" Kaylynn responded. \"They were just using their voice.\"\n\nBoth Hansen and Williams called 911 after the incident to report that they saw a man killed by police.\n\n\"I believe I witnessed a murder,\" Williams said. \"I felt the need to call the police on the police.\"\n\nChauvin, who was captured on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, is facing charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder , and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nTestimony in Chauvin's trial will continue Wednesday morning.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Video shows students reenacted the murder of George Floyd at a high school with a history of racist incidents\n\nHigh school students in Arizona were filmed reenacting George Floyd's murder in a video that later went viral on Twitter, as users called it \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\nIn the six-second video, which was posted on Twitter on April 28, one student is seen kneeling on the neck of another student while someone in the background can be heard saying, \"they're demonstrating,\" and laughing.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly when the incident was filmed, but the video, which took place at Highland High School in Gilbert, Arizona, according to local reports , was publicized soon after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was found guilty of murdering Floyd, a Black man, on April 20. The footage of the murder, which showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck on May 25, 2020, was widely shared online, sparked worldwide protests, and was instrumental in Chauvin's conviction .\n\nThe high school was previously criticized for \"falling short of addressing racism,\" the Arizona Republic reported . The video also appears to follow a startling trend of people reenacting the viral video of Floyd's death.\n\nMelinda Murphy, the school principal, told parents in an email that the video was being investigated and \"all parties involved were disciplined according to Gilbert Schools policy,\" The Arizona Republic reported. It was not immediately clear how the students in the video were disciplined.\n\nHighland High School did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nTwitter user @MercedezUAZ2 posted the video with the caption, \"This video was taken right in front of the only black girl in the class TODAY & happens to be my friend's niece. They're reenacting the murder of #GeorgeFloyd !\" The video has over 135,000 views as of Monday.\n\nA representative for the Gilbert School District told The Root that the situation had been addressed. \"Gilbert Public Schools strives to create communities of inclusion, and any act of racism is in direct opposition to the values that we hold as a school district,\" the representative said.\n\nHanaan Abdull, a senior at Highland High and president of the Black Student Union at Highland High School, told the Arizona Republic that this was not an isolated incident. \"I don't want to make it seem that the student recreating the murder of George Floyd is just a silly act of racism. These aren't mistakes; these are premeditated. This is a hate crime. This is a textbook hate crime,\" Abdull said.\n\nHighland High has previously faced other race-related controversies. In June 2020, two students at the school posted a video of themselves repeatedly using the N-word to TikTok, according to the Arizona Republic . Other Twitter users shared photos of alleged students of the school using the \"OK\" hand gesture, which is used by white supremacists, and claimed the students in the photo were a part of the school's MAGA club.\n\nThe Arizona Republic reported at the time that Gilbert Superintendent Shane McCord \"vowed to commit to diversity training for staff members after social media users described several racist instances involving students.\"\n\nOther Americans have faced consequences for reenacting the Floyd video over the last year.\n\nA similar investigation began at Westside High School in Omaha, Nebraska, after students circulated a photo of one student kneeling on another's neck. According to KETV NewsWatch 7 , the school's principal said in an email to parents that the students had intended to recreate the murder of George Floyd. Two men in New Jersey were also filmed reenacting the murder in June 2020.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Derek Chauvin and 3 other former officers pleaded not guilty to violating George Floyd's civil rights\n\nDerek Chauvin and three of his former Minneapolis police colleagues pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal civil rights charges in the death of George Floyd.\n\nChauvin, who was convicted of Floyd's murder in state court , appeared at an arraignment hearing via Zoom along with ex-officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Keung, and Thomas Lane.\n\nThe four officers are charged with violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force, as well as failing to provide Floyd with medical care. Chauvin faces a second federal civil rights indictment stemming from the violent arrest of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.\n\nFloyd was killed on May 25, 2020, outside of a Cup Foods convenience store in Minneapolis. The jury in Chauvin's murder case heard evidence that the senior officer kneeled on Floyd for more than nine minutes as he begged for his life. Thao, Kueng, and Lane await their own state trials on charges related to Floyd's death.\n\nLawyers for Chauvin's co-defendants argued Tuesday that their clients should be tried separately, saying that Chauvin's conviction would unfairly prejudice a federal jury against them.\n\n\"We should be severed from Derek Chauvin because we should not be settled or branded with his conviction of murder on the same facts,\" Thomas Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, said. \"Everyone knows Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder, so are we going to be presumed innocent? I don't think so.\"\n\nChauvin appeared in the hearing by video from the Minnesota Correctional Facility at Oak Park Heights, where he is serving his 22 1/2 year sentence on the Floyd murder. At one point during the arraignment, whistling, slamming doors, and other background noise at the prison was disrupting the court proceeding and Chauvin needed to mute his feed.\n\nGray and Thomas C. Plunkett, the attorney who represents Kueng, have already made reference to their clients being junior officers who'd spent only a few days on the job at the time of the Floyd's death.\n\nFor that same reason, Thao, who'd been a Minneapolis police officer for years, wants to be tried separately from all his former colleagues, his attorney Robert Paulie said.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Manda Sertich argued that severing the former officers' cases wouldn't be helpful because any juror would know about the conviction, whether or not Chauvin himself was sitting in the courtroom.\n\nWhile the officers' cases had already been severed in state court, US Magistrate Judge Tony Leung noted that it is rare to sever cases in federal court. He didn't rule on the former officers' motion Tuesday.\n\nJump to"

Chauvin is asking the judge who presided over his trial to throw out his conviction and order a new trial, or at least an evidentiary hearing.\n\nFloyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020 , after Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on his neck for 91⁄2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. A bystander video captured Floyd's fading cries of \"I can't breathe.\" Floyd's death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism .\n\nChauvin, who is serving a 21-year sentence at a federal prison in Arizona, filed the request without a lawyer. He says Dr. William Schaetzel, of Topeka, Kansas, told him that he believes Floyd died not from asphyxia from Chauvin's actions, but from complications of a rare tumor called a paraganglioma that can cause a fatal surge of adrenaline. The pathologist did not examine Floyd's body but reviewed autopsy reports.\n\n\"I can't go to my grave with what I know,\" Schaetzel told The Associated Press by phone on Monday, explaining why he reached out to Chauvin. He went on to say, \"I just want the truth.\"\n\nChauvin further alleges that Schaetzel reached out to his trial attorney, Eric Nelson, in 2021, as well as the judge and prosecution in his state-court murder trial, but that Nelson never told him about the pathologist or his ideas. He also alleges that Nelson failed to challenge the constitutionality of the federal charge.\n\nBut Chauvin claims in his motion that no jury would have convicted him if it had heard the pathologist's evidence\n\nNelson declined to comment Monday.\n\nWhen Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charge in December 2021, he waived his rights to appeal except on the basis of a claim of ineffective counsel.\n\nA federal appeals court has rejected Chauvin's requests for a rehearing twice. He's still waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether it will hear his appeal of his state court murder conviction.\n\nThree other former officers who were at the scene received lesser state and federal sentences for their roles in Floyd's death.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "George Floyd's murder led to a national reckoning on policing, but efforts have stalled or reversed\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nFour years ago, protests erupted across the country after millions of Americans watched the chilling video of the murder of George Floyd - a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nIn the aftermath, Chauvin was convicted of murder and calls for a nationwide reckoning on issues related to racism and police violence reverberated in city after city. But in the years since then, some of those efforts at change, like the federal George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, have stalled. In several states, calls to pass criminal justice reforms to address decadeslong racial disparities have stalled or been met with tough-on-crime rhetoric and policies.\n\nFor Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, the initial calls for change after his brother's death were touching.\n\n\"The fact that he was stolen from us. We still can't get over that,\" he said in an interview. \"So many people, they felt the same pain all across the world.\"\n\nBut as he talked about the lack of change and his inability to lobby Congress to pass the federal bill named after his brother, Philonise Floyd broke down in tears.\n\n\"It's different. It is really like you don't have the understanding of how you can sit there and witness that somebody murdered your brother and four years later, it still hasn't been any change,\" he said while weeping. \"You're still trying to pass the same law for your brother. And the city and the world stood with you, and we still haven't gotten, like, any kind of change. What is it going to take?\"\n\nIn recent years, many conservative states - and some progressive parts of the country - have passed tough-on-crime policies.\n\nIn Georgia, lawmakers rolled back 2018 criminal justice reforms, which were supported by Republicans, and added cash bail requirements for 30 new crimes this year. In Tennessee, lawmakers passed a bill to block some reforms related to how police handle traffic stops, including a Memphis law enacted following the killing of Tyre Nichols, a young Black man who died after several police officers violently beat him.\n\nMaryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed into law a controversial juvenile justice bill that allows the state to prosecute children as young as 10 who are accused of serious offenses. Oregon passed a bill recriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs, a move that reverses key parts of an earlier law that did just the opposite.\n\nCritics of tough-on-crime approaches point to Florida as ground zero for the new measures. There, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has championed and signed several bills into law related to police. Those measures include an \"anti-rioting\" law that may curtail protests, which is currently embroiled in a legal challenge at the Florida Supreme Court.\n\n\"We saw really unprecedented disorder and rioting throughout the summer of 2020, and we said that's not going to happen here in the state of Florida,\" DeSantis said before signing the bill into law in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, two other laws - one that limits the power of police civilian review boards in the state, and another that mandates that anyone observing or filming first responders stay 25 feet away when asked - are expected to take effect later this year.\n\nSince his election in 2020, Republican state Rep. Tom Fabricio has supported the measures and said he is serving the will of his constituents.\n\n\"We want to have Florida be a law-and-order state,\" he said. \"We don't want abusive law and order. But we want more law and order, and I believe that's what we've been able to provide to the Florida residents.\"\n\nRepublican state Rep. Alex Rizo sponsored the \"Halo Bill,\" concerning bystanders filming first responders, which is expected to take effect next January.\n\nWhen asked whether the bill was part of the backlash to calls for reform after a bystander's video of Floyd's death emerged, Rizo said it was not and that the bill \"allows for a safe space for the first responder to go ahead and perform their duties.\"\n\n\"The overarching theme and all of these laws that we've passed over the last four years is safety for all Floridians - that includes whether you wear a badge or you don't,\" Rizo said.\n\nThe lawmaker added that civilian review boards across the state should be abolished and that police department oversight be handled by elected officials like city councilors and mayors.\n\n\"You cannot delegate responsibility, and ultimately, the elected leaders, the people that put their name out there and ask for that position, they're the ones that should be held accountable in the end,\" Rizo said.\n\nRodney Jacobs, the executive director of Miami's Civilian Investigative Panel, which oversees independent investigations of police misconduct, vehemently disagrees. He said the work of the panel, which handles some 300 complaints a year, is vital to protecting communities.\n\n\"For so long, people have been asking for police accountability for misconduct,\" he said. \"I think the further we get away from implementing that, the further we get away from having the will to do that constructive work. We will never bridge the gaps between our law enforcement in our community.\"\n\nSome believe that gap was made larger in March when Miami police shot Donald Armstrong after his mother called to get him help during a mental health crisis. Police said Armstrong was waving a sharp object. His lawyer, Larry R. Handfield, said he was holding a small conductor baton. Armstrong is now paralyzed and in jail.\n\nHandfield also told NBC News that he plans to file a civil suit against the city of Miami. But, he said, he also wants to resolve the misdemeanor probation violation charge quickly so Armstrong can get help.\n\nPreston Baldwin, who lived a block away from Armstrong, filmed the shooting and said he is glad he was able to help provide context for what happened. Baldwin said police should have worked harder to de-escalate the incident and not shot Armstrong.\n\n\"I felt like if something was to happen, we would need some unbiased eye,\" he said. \"It's heavy because it's like, dude, it really could be me. Like I could be this guy. It only takes one second to mistake somebody, one second to misconstrue words.\"\n\nBaldwin moved to Miami from Minnesota, where he protested after Floyd's death. Now, he's left wondering what's next.\n\n\"We're kind of like, we're in a circle,\" he said. \"Back to police shootings being the main thing on the news again, you know, people arguing or people not liking each other about race or whatever. We went right back to the same thing that started all this.\"\n\nStill, for Rachel Gilmer, a leader in the Dream Defenders social justice group, the pushback on efforts for change fuels her to keep going.\n\n\"Young people, like our generation, have the most radical, progressive vision for the future of this country,\" she said. \"All of the backlash that we're seeing against that vision also speaks to the power of that vision, and the popularity of that vision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Philonise Floyd and his wife, Keeta, who have started a civil rights organization, now work with many other families affected by police violence. They said they are determined to keep fighting in George Floyd's name as his young daughter, Gianna, grows up without a father.\n\n\"It seems like now everybody's just trying to sweep it under the rug as best we can because we don't talk about it anymore,\" Keeta Floyd said. \"Like, 'Oh, they're not as angry as they used to be.' But we are. We lost George.\"\n\nHer husband echoed those sentiments. \"I'm going to continue to turn my pain into purpose,\" Philonise Floyd said. \"And this bill needs to be passed because my brother's blood is all on this bill. ... At the end of the day, if you want to make change, show it to me.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nYamiche Alcindor is an NBC News Washington correspondent.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The interview had been viewed nearly 2 million times on YouTube as of Monday afternoon.\n\nYe said his claims were backed by a documentary by conservative commentator Candace Owens.\n\nHis remarks drew widespread condemnation, including from civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who tweeted Sunday: \"While one cannot defame the dead, the family of #GeorgeFloyd is considering suit for Kanye's false statements about the manner of his death. Claiming Floyd died from fentanyl not the brutality established criminally and civilly undermines & diminishes the Floyd family's fight.\"\n\nMerritt said Monday that he had been contacted Sunday by Floyd's brother, Philonise, about whether legal action can be taken to prevent Ye from repeating debunked claims about Floyd's death. Merritt said he is also looking into whether Owens can be sued on similar grounds as well.\n\nChauvin was convicted in April 2021 of second- and third-degree murder , as well as second-degree manslaughter, and was sentenced in June 2021 to 22 1⁄2 years in prison . He pleaded guilty last year to a federal charge of violating Floyd's civil rights by using excessive force under color of law and was sentenced to just more than 20 years in July. His federal and state sentences are to be served concurrently.\n\nThe medical examiner who ruled Floyd's death a homicide testified during Chauvin's state trial that Floyd's heart disease and drug use contributed to his death, but that police officers' restraint of his body and compression of his neck were the primary causes . Other prosecution expert witnesses were explicit in their assessments that Floyd died from asphyxia, or low oxygen.\n\nAt his sentencing in the federal civil rights case, Judge Paul Magnuson of U.S. District Court in St. Paul told Chauvin, who was the most senior of the four officers at the scene: \"I really don't know why you did what you did. But to put your knee on another person's neck until they expired is simply wrong, and for that conduct you must be substantially punished.\"\n\nThree other former police officers were also charged in connection with Floyd's death: Thomas Lane, who held down his legs as he cried out that he couldn't breathe; J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd; and Tou Thao, who kept concerned bystanders at bay .\n\nThe officers encountered Floyd on May 25, 2020, outside a convenience store where he was alleged to have used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Video of Floyd's final moments taken by bystanders touched off protests around the world against police brutality and systemic racism.\n\nLane pleaded guilty last month to a state charge of second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's killing and was sentenced to three years in prison. Kueng and Thao, who rejected a plea deal, are set to go on trial this month.\n\nThe three men were convicted in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights while acting under government authority when they failed to give him medical aid. Kueng and Thao were also convicted for failing to intervene. In July, Kueng was sentenced in federal court to three years and Thao to three and a half years.\n\nYe, who has courted controversy in recent weeks, was blocked from posting on Twitter and Instagram about a week ago over antisemitic posts that the social networks said violated their policies. In one tweet, Ye said he would soon go \"death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,\" according to internet archive records, making an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale known as DEFCON. This month, Ye, who once suggested slavery was a choice, was criticized for wearing a \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt, alongside Owens, to his collection at Paris Fashion Week. The Anti-Defamation League has called the phrase hate speech.\n\nMany criticized Drink Champs and its hosts, rapper N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN, on social media, for giving a platform to Ye's racist talking points that denied the brutality Floyd was subjected to and the excessive force Black people experience in some encounters with police.\n\nDuring a call-in interview Monday with The Breakfast Club, a nationally syndicated radio show, N.O.R.E. apologized to Floyd's family and said that Drink Champs will edit future broadcasts.\n\n\"I just want to be honest. I support freedom of speech. I support anybody, you know, not being censored,\" he said. \"But I do not support anybody being hurt. I did not realize that the George Floyd statements on my show was so hurtful. And you got to realize, it was the first five minutes of the show. Like when he walked in, he told my producer, he said that if he'll stop filming, he'll walk out.\"\n\nN.O.R.E. also said he \"checked\" Ye over his comments about Floyd and White Lives Matter, but said it was so late in the episode and \"I was already inebriated at that time that maybe people looked over it.\"\n\n\"I apologize to the George Floyd family,\" he said. \"I apologize to anybody that was hurt by Kanye West's comments.\"\n\nEarly Monday, it was announced that Ye had agreed in principle to acquire the conservative-oriented social media app Parler . Parlement Technologies, the parent company of Parler, announced \"it has entered into an agreement in principle to sell Parler\" to Ye, who has been \"taking a bold stance against his recent censorship from Big Tech.\"\n\n\"In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,\" Ye said in a statement.\n\nGeorge Farmer, the chief executive of Parlement, who is married to Owens, said in a statement Monday that \"Ye's acquiring of Parler will strengthen our ability to create an uncancelable ecosystem.\"\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Many know how George Floyd died. A new biography reveals how he lived\n\nBy\n\nAdrian Florido\n\n,\n\nJonaki Mehta\n\n,\n\nPatrick Jarenwattananon\n\nA mural of George Floyd at the intersection where he was murdered in Minneapolis, Minn. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption\n\nA mural of George Floyd at the intersection where he was murdered in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nTwo years after his murder, most people still only know George Floyd for the way he died: Under the knee of a police officer in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nMany don't know how he lived - that he habitually told friends that he loved them, often in all-caps text messages; that he was self-conscious about his 6-foot-6-inch frame and that he suffered from lifelong claustrophobia; that he and his roommate in Minneapolis moved their mattresses into the living room right next to each other.\n\n\"They wanted to watch over each other. They had met each other in rehab, and they wanted to help ensure that they didn't stray,\" said Robert Samuels, a national political enterprise reporter for The Washington Post.\n\n\"What George Floyd understood was that they were in a society that was unforgiving toward their missteps, and they needed to look out for each other if they were going to make it through.\"\n\nSamuels and his colleague Toluse Olorunnipa are the authors of the new biography, His Name Is George Floyd: One Man's Life And The Struggle For Racial Justice . The pair of reporters say the book is a story about how racism affected every part of Floyd's life, starting more than 150 years ago.\n\n\"We traced his ancestry back to a great-great-grandfather who was born and enslaved in North Carolina and, after the Civil War, was able to get his freedom,\" Olorunnipa said. \"And he quickly amassed a great amount of wealth and land by working the land with his large family. But during the turn of the century, he lost all of his land to fraudulent tax sales and dubious business deals, and he was unable to transfer any of that to his descendants.\"\n\nIt was important to show why Floyd came into the world poor, Olorunnipa said.\n\n\"We saw George Floyd's family wealth be stripped away because of racism. And it impacted his life,\" Olorunnipa said. \"It impacted his beginning and made him essentially come into the world born with two strikes as someone who was Black and poor in America.\"\n\nOlorunnipa and Samuels spoke with NPR's All Things Considered about Floyd's personality, his awareness of his physical presence, his missteps and how he was on his way to coming back from them.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFlorido: One detail that struck me in your reporting and that comes up over and over throughout the book is he was really aware that his sort of mere presence as a big, Black man often scared people. Why did you dive into this aspect of his personality?\n\nOlorunnipa: It's key to understanding those moments that we all saw on the video of Floyd's final moments, his fear of being assaulted by the police. From his earliest days, he would go into a room and shake everyone by hand just to put them at ease, just to say, you know, \"I know I'm a big guy, I know my size may intimidate you, but, you know, look at me eye to eye. I'm OK, I'm not going to hurt you.\" And that was something that was a big part of his personality.\n\nSamuels: It was also one of the cruelest contradictions about himself. By the time he gets to high school, he is this tall string bean of a guy. And immediately, people say, what you need to do is focus on playing football. And George Floyd was taught that maybe academics isn't the way to escape poverty, football is. But he was left with a body that - if it was not on a football field, it would be seen as something intimidating, threatening and, ultimately, one of the things that would make him seem as a threat to a police officer.\n\nYour book doesn't shy away from Floyd's missteps. He was arrested on drug charges. He was addicted to opioids. He pled guilty to an armed robbery for which he spent years in prison. And his friends and family seem to speak to you pretty openly about his criminal record. What did they say about his struggles with the law?\n\nOlorunnipa: They wanted us to understand that Floyd wasn't someone who wanted to take advantage of other people, but he also was someone who came from a community that was ravaged by drugs and where police officers often targeted for low-hanging-fruit arrest. Floyd was once arrested for just walking through his neighborhood - literally - for trespassing. He was across the street from his house. And he was stopped more than 20 times over the course of his life, including by six officers who were later charged themselves with breaking the law. So there is a sense of police corruption that took place.\n\nNow, Floyd's own mistakes were definitely evident. And we got access to his diary entries and his writings in which he agonized over his mistakes and over the decisions that he made and the struggles that he had to try to break free from addiction and break free from his criminal past.\n\nDemonstrators hold a vigil in honor of George Floyd on March 8, 2021 in Atlanta, Ga. Megan Varner/Getty Images hide caption\n\nDemonstrators hold a vigil in honor of George Floyd on March 8, 2021 in Atlanta, Ga.\n\nWell, the way he tried to reset his life was by moving to Minnesota in 2017 from Texas, where he'd lived for most of his life. And he signed up for a rehabilitation program designed for Black men. He found a roommate. He managed to rent this fancy townhome in the middle of a middle-class white suburb. For a while, things seem to be looking up for him in Minneapolis, didn't they?\n\nSamuels: Yeah. This was his dream. He found a job. He was clean. He got this new townhome with his roommate, the person who he met in rehab. And a few months after he leaves rehab and he's living in this townhome, he comes home after a double shift of working, and he encounters his roommate unconscious and cold on the couch, Big E. And it turns out that Big E had overdosed.\n\nAnd he died. And when that happened, the gregarious, friendly George Floyd that everyone knew, he went into isolation. And when one of his friends happened to run into him at a gas station, he tells his friend about what a dark place he was in. And that set George Floyd on a course to relapse.\n\nAs I read your book, I really came to understand what a special man George Floyd was. But I also sort of found myself wondering, was he unique or could you have written this kind of book about many other Black men?\n\nSamuels: I think all of us know someone like George Floyd in our lives that you love being around, that can be a little hapless, that things in life have never fully gone their way, but they carry on a spirit of persistence. But one thing that we wanted folks to understand when they read the book is that the institutional hardships and barriers that were presented to George Floyd could have happened to almost any Black man living in America. And that's one of the terrifying things about it.\n\nToluse and I, we were very conscientious about how easy it can be to exploit Black pain as if that were the full story. But one of the wonderful things about writing about George Floyd is George Floyd himself, who never stopped trying, who remained persistent even though he acknowledged those barriers and acknowledged those mistakes. And that is a reason why I think so many people who knew him took up the cause for justice.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison also confirmed to The Star Tribune that Chauvin, 47, was stabbed but remains in stable condition.\n\n\"I am sad to hear that Derek Chauvin was the target of violence,\" Ellison said. \"He was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence.\"\n\nBoth the Bureau of Prisons and an FBI spokesperson based in Arizona confirmed to NPR that an inmate was assaulted at the federal prison on Friday, but neither agency would confirm it was Chauvin.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons added that \"life-saving measures\" were performed on the inmate.

Chauvin, who is white, pinned Floyd to the ground and held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd's death and the horrific way he died, which was captured on video, sparked massive protests across the country over racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nThree other Minneapolis officers who helped with restraining Floyd were convicted of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care.

The ruling came hours before Chauvin was to be sentenced for murder in Floyd's death .\n\nRequests for new trials after a conviction are routine but rarely granted.\n\nChauvin, 45, pinned Floyd to a Minneapolis street for about 9 1/2 minutes on May 25, 2020, ignoring the Black man's cries of \"I can't breathe\" and the shouts of onlookers. Bystander video of Floyd's death sparked protests in Minneapolis, some violent, and quickly spread around the world.\n\nChauvin attorney Eric Nelson argued that intense publicity around Floyd's death tainted the jury pool and that the trial should have been moved away from Minneapolis. He also offered a range of other arguments, all dismissed by prosecutors, who said Chauvin was fairly convicted.\n\nCahill also rejected Nelson's request for a hearing into possible juror misconduct. The defense accused juror Brandon Mitchell of not being candid during jury selection because he didn't mention his participation in a march last summer to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutors countered that Mitchell had been open about his views in a jury questionnaire and during the questioning of potential jurors.\n\nThe judge ruled the defense didn't show any evidence of juror misconduct either during trial or during jury selection that warranted an evidentiary hearing.\n\nChauvin is expected to appeal his conviction.\n\nby Bill Chappell\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin addresses the court Friday at his sentencing hearing. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd. Court TV via AP/Pool hide caption\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin addresses the court Friday at his sentencing hearing. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd.\n\nA Minnesota judge sentenced Derek Chauvin to 22 1/2 years in prison Friday for the murder of George Floyd - a punishment that exceeds the state's minimum guidelines but falls short of prosecutors' request of a 30-year sentence .\n\nAs he issued the sentence, Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said Chauvin will be credited for the 199 days he has already served.\n\nThe sentence \"is one of the longest a former police officer has ever received for an unlawful use of deadly force,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said, calling it a \"moment of real accountability.\"\n\nCahill detailed his reasoning in a 22-page legal memorandum . In court, he spoke about pain - something he said has marked this case.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family,\" Cahill said. \"You have our sympathies, and I acknowledge and hear the pain that you are feeling.\"\n\n\"It has been painful throughout Hennepin County, throughout the state of Minnesota and even the country. But most importantly, we need to recognize the pain of the Floyd family.\"\n\nChauvin offered little reaction when the sentence was announced. As soon as Cahill adjourned the hearing, Chauvin stood, nodded to his attorney, Eric Nelson, and followed a sheriff's deputy out of the courtroom.\n\nAfter the hearing, attorney Benjamin Crump issued a statement along with the Floyd family saying that the sentence brings healing and accountability.\n\n\"For once, a police officer who wrongly took the life of a Black man was held to account,\" the statement said.\n\nWith Chauvin's punishment, it added that \"we take a significant step forward - something that was unimaginable a very short time ago.\"\n\nFloyd's family and their attorneys also called for Chauvin to be convicted on federal civil rights charges that he's facing.\n\nThe video footage of Floyd's death is seared into the minds of people who watched it, Ellison said. He called on police, prosecutors and communities to bring about societal change  - to push for more accountability, so civilians and the police act with trust and cooperation. He also had a message for lawmakers.\n\n\"Congress has still not passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act ,\" Ellison said, urging legislators to approve the strongest version of the bill they can.\n\n\"Lives are depending on it,\" he added. \"It's that simple.\"\n\nIn April, a jury found the former Minneapolis police officer, who is white, guilty of murdering Floyd, who was Black, on Memorial Day 2020. The killing triggered massive protests against racial injustice and also prompted reviews of the police use of force - including how much the law should protect officers when someone dies in their custody.\n\nAs in earlier proceedings, the sentencing hearing was livestreamed from the courtroom. The sentence announcement followed emotional victim impact statements from Floyd's family as well as a heartfelt message of support from Chauvin's mother.\n\nChauvin was seen on video pressing his knee onto Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds as Floyd lay facedown on the asphalt outside a convenience store with his hands cuffed behind his back. The police had been called to the store after Floyd allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to pay for cigarettes.\n\nThe guilty verdict against Chauvin was hailed as a civil rights victory . Since then, his prison sentence has been awaited as a possible affirmation of that victory.\n\nUnder Minnesota law, people sentenced to prison become eligible to be considered for parole after serving two-thirds of their sentence as long as they've had no disciplinary problems while in custody.\n\nAt Friday's sentencing hearing, Chauvin wore a suit rather than a prisoner's uniform by a special order of the court.\n\nChauvin, who did not testify during his trial, addressed the court Friday in remarks that he said would be kept brief as he is still facing other legal issues - including federal charges.\n\n\"I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family,\" Chauvin said as he looked toward Floyd's relatives in the courtroom.\n\nAnd in a cryptic moment , the former officer added, \"There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some, some peace of mind. Thank you.\"\n\nChauvin \"is the first white officer in Minnesota to face prison time for the killing of a Black man,\" according to NPR member station Minnesota Public Radio .\n\nLegal experts note that while Chauvin's sentence falls short of prosecutors' request, it's also well above the range of a presumptive sentence for second-degree murder.\n\n\"Because sentencing of a police officer for homicide is so rare, the judge was in somewhat uncharted waters,\" said Christopher Slobogin, a criminal law professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nHe added, \"But given the aggravating factors the judge found, the sentence seems neither particularly harsh nor especially lenient.\"\n\nFloyd's loved ones delivered four victim impact statements in court. The first was a video conversation with Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna .\n\n\"I ask about him all the time,\" she said, adding that she wants to know, \"How did my dad get hurt?\"\n\nGianna said her father is still with her in spirit. When she sees him again, she said, she wants to play with him.\n\n\"I miss you and I love you,\" she said she would tell her father, adding that every night, he used to help her brush her teeth.\n\nThe girl added that other people have helped her father after \"those mean people did something to him.\"\n\n\"This situation has really affected me and my family,\" Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd said.\n\nAddressing Chauvin in the courtroom, Floyd said he has some questions.\n\n\"Why? What were you thinking? What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brother's neck?\"\n\nHe then took a moment to compose himself after growing emotional.\n\nPhilonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd, becomes emotional during a victim impact statement Friday at Chauvin's sentencing hearing. Court TV via AP/Pool hide caption\n\nPhilonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd, becomes emotional during a victim impact statement Friday at Chauvin's sentencing hearing.\n\nHe went on to describe how in one of his last conversations with his brother, they had been planning play dates for their daughters.\n\nAsking for a maximum penalty against Chauvin, Terrence Floyd said there should be \"no more slaps on the wrist.\"\n\nPhilonise Floyd, who has become an outspoken advocate for his late brother, then told the court that he has relived his death repeatedly in the past year. He no longer knows what it feels like to get a full night's sleep, he said.\n\n\"My family and I have been given a life sentence\" to live without George Floyd, Philonise Floyd added.\n\nChauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, spoke in court on her son's behalf and for her entire family, she said.\n\nAll their lives changed forever the day George Floyd died, Pawlenty said.\n\nHer son is not an \"aggressive, heartless and uncaring person,\" or a racist, she said. \"My son is a good man,\" Pawlenty said, noting his years of dedication to being a police officer.\n\nSaying that she supports her son 100%, she added that the past year has taken a toll on him.\n\n\"When you sentence my son, you will also be sentencing me,\" Pawlenty told the judge. She noted that if her son serves a long prison term, his parents may not be alive when he is released.\n\nAddressing Chauvin, Pawlenty said she is on his side and told him to be strong.\n\n\"Remember you are my favorite son,\" she said.\n\nMinnesota guidelines called for Chauvin to be sentenced to around 12 1/2 years for second-degree unintentional murder, given his lack of prior criminal history. But state prosecutors pushed for a 30-year term, saying Chauvin \"acted with particular cruelty,\" among other aggravating factors in the case.\n\nThe prosecution also cited Chauvin's abuse of a position of authority and Floyd's killing in front of children and other witnesses, saying his punishment requires an \"upward departure\" from the guidelines. Cahill agreed , saying that aggravating factors had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNelson, Chauvin's attorney, asked for the former officer to be sentenced to probation along with time already served, saying that his client would likely be a target in prison. He also said that with the support of his family and friends, Chauvin, 45, still has the potential to be a positive influence on his community.\n\nChauvin was found guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But he was being punished only for the most serious charge: second-degree murder while committing a felony. In Minnesota, a person convicted of multiple crimes that happened at the same time is typically only sentenced for the most severe charge.\n\nThe state's maximum prison term for second-degree unintentional murder is 40 years , although the sentencing guidelines for second-degree unintentional murder largely taper off at 24 years.\n\nA jury found Chauvin guilty in April in the 2020 killing of Floyd.

Here, Chauvin listens to the verdict at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis.\n\nWeeks after Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd, the Justice Department announced federal criminal charges against him and three of his fellow former officers over Floyd's death.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted the four on charges of violating Floyd's civil rights, with Chauvin accused of using excessive force and ignoring the medical emergency that ended in Floyd's death.\n\nThe other former officers - J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao - are also accused of not getting immediate medical help for Floyd, with Kueng and Thao facing an additional charge of failing to intervene and showing \"deliberate indifference\" to Floyd's predicament.\n\nThe grand jury also indicted Chauvin over an arrest he made in 2017 in which he allegedly used a neck restraint and beat a teenager with a flashlight.\n\nNo trial date has been announced for the federal charges.\n\nThe three other former officers were already facing a state trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting. But that trial has now been postponed until March.\n\nAll four of the Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd's death were fired days after the killing.\n\nNelson had asked the state court for a new trial for Chauvin, saying intense press coverage tainted the jury pool. He also alleged prosecutorial misconduct, related to issues such as sharing evidence and handling witnesses.

Chauvin's actions against Floyd, for instance, were described by Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo as violating the department's policies on the use of force as well de-escalation and rendering aid.\n\nAdvocates of police reform also say it's time to limit or revoke qualified immunity - a legal doctrine established by the Supreme Court in 1967 that has been used to shield officers from facing liability for egregious actions while on duty.\n\nDemonstrators gather outside Cup Foods in April in Minneapolis to celebrate the murder conviction of Chauvin in Floyd's killing.

Court TV/AP hide caption\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson (left) and defendant, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, address Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minn. during his trial.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence for the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder in George Floyd's death , but a defense attorney is asking that Derek Chauvin be sentenced to probation and time already served, according to court documents filed Wednesday.\n\nChauvin is scheduled to be sentenced June 25 following his conviction on murder and manslaughter charges. Judge Peter Cahill previously ruled there were aggravating factors in Floyd's death. That gives him the discretion to sentence Chauvin above the range recommended by state guidelines, which top out at 15 years.\n\nProsecutors said Chauvin's actions were egregious and a sentence of 30 years would \"properly account for the profound impact of Defendant's conduct on the victim, the victim's family, and the community.\" They said that Chauvin's actions \"shocked the Nation's conscience.\"\n\n\"No sentence can undo Mr. Floyd's death, and no sentence can undo the trauma Defendant's actions have inflicted. But the sentence the Court imposes must show that no one is above the law, and no one is below it,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Defendant's sentence must hold him fully accountable for his reprehensible conduct.\"\n\nDefense attorney Eric Nelson cited Chauvin's age, lack of a criminal record, and support from family and friends in requesting a sentence of probation and time served. He said Chauvin, 45, was the product of a \"broken\" system.\n\nMark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, said it's not unusual for attorneys to make these kinds of requests as a sort of \"opening offer.\" He said there is zero chance that Chauvin will get probation, and prosecutors are also unlikely to get the 30 years they are requesting.\n\nHe said Nelson's attempts to paint Chauvin as a good fit for probation and a law-abiding citizen will probably face \"ferocious push-back from the government,\" given Chauvin is also charged with tax evasion. He added that Nelson's reference to Chauvin being the product of a broken system is \"fascinating - most Americans seem to think that Chauvin embodies what is broken about our system of criminal justice.\"\n\nChauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for about 9 1/2 minutes as the Black man said he couldn't breathe and went motionless. Floyd's death, captured on widely seen bystander video, set off demonstrations around the United States and beyond as protesters demanded changes in policing.\n\nEven though Chauvin was found guilty of three counts, he'll only be sentenced on the most serious one - second-degree murder. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, with no criminal record he faces a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years on that count. Cahill can sentence him to as little as 10 years and eight months or as much as 15 years and stay within the guideline range.\n\nBut prosecutors asked for what is known as an upward departure, saying there were several aggravating factors that warranted a higher sentence. Cahill agreed, finding Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, abused his position of authority as a police officer, committed his crime as part of a group of three or more people, and that he pinned Floyd down in the presence of children.\n\nProsecutors said that even one of those factors would warrant the higher sentence.\n\nNelson wrote that while this incident painted Chauvin as a \"dangerous man,\" he has served his community as an officer and has a loving family and close friends. He also disputed the court's finding that aggravating factors existed, saying there is no evidence that Chauvin's assault on Floyd included gratuitous infliction of pain or cruelty.\n\n\"Here, Mr. Chauvin was unaware that he was even committing a crime. In fact, in his mind, he was simply performing his lawful duty in assisting other officers in the arrest of George Floyd,\" Nelson wrote, adding that Chauvin's offense can be best described as an error made in good faith based on his experience and the training he received - and was not the intentional commission of a crime.\n\n\"In spite of the notoriety surrounding this case, the Court must look to the facts. They all point to the single most important fact: Mr. Chauvin did not intend to cause George Floyd's death. He believed he was doing his job,\" he wrote.\n\nNo matter what sentence Chauvin gets, in Minnesota it's presumed that a defendant with good behavior will serve two-thirds of the penalty in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole.\n\nNelson is also seeking a new trial for Chauvin - which is a fairly routine request after a conviction. He argued extensive pretrial publicity tainted the jury pool and denied Chauvin his right to a fair trial. He also said Cahill also abused his authority when he declined defense requests to move the trial out of Minneapolis and sequester the jury. And, he said the state committed prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nNelson is also asking for a hearing to investigate whether there was juror misconduct. Nelson alleged that an alternate juror who made public comments indicated she felt pressured to render a guilty verdict, and another juror who deliberated did not follow jury instructions and was not candid during jury selection. That juror, Brandon Mitchell, did not mention that he had participated in an Aug. 28 march in Washington, D.C., to honor Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nNelson alleged that Mitchell made comments to the media that indicated he based his verdict on outside influence.\n\nProsecutors have a week to submit a written response to those arguments.\n\nChauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest. The three other former officers involved in Floyd's death were also charged with federal civil rights violations; they await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts.\n\nA federal trial date has not been set. Federal prosecutors are asking for more time to prepare for trial, saying the case is complex because of the sheer volume of evidence and the separate but coordinated state and federal investigations.\n\nby Laurel Wamsley\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, seen here in an April 21 booking photo, may face a longer sentence after Judge Peter Cahill found aggravating factors in the case. Minnesota Department of Corrections via AP hide caption\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, seen here in an April 21 booking photo, may face a longer sentence after Judge Peter Cahill found aggravating factors in the case.\n\nA Minnesota judge has found aggravating factors in Derek Chauvin's murder of George Floyd - a finding that dramatically increases the likelihood of a longer sentence.\n\nChauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was found guilty last month of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd in May 2020.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill said in an order made public Wednesday that four aggravating factors are present in the case: Chauvin abused a position of trust and authority as a police officer, treated Floyd with \"particular cruelty,\" committed the crime as part of a group with at least three other people, and that children were present during the commission of the offense.\n\nDuring the trial, a 9-year-old girl who had witnessed the incident testified that seeing it made her feel \"sad and kinda mad.\"\n\nChauvin was found guilty of all the counts against him, but in Minnesota, a person convicted of multiple crimes for a single incident is typically only sentenced for the most severe charge. In this case, that's second-degree murder.\n\nThe maximum sentence for that charge is 40 years, but state sentencing guidelines recommend 12.5 years in prison for a conviction on unintentional second-degree murder for someone with no criminal history. Prosecutors sought an upward departure from that duration, arguing that there were multiple aggravating factors in the case.\n\nCahill agreed with prosecutors, other than their argument that Floyd was particularly vulnerable. \"Restraining George Floyd in the prone position with the weight of three police officers on him for a prolonged period did not create a vulnerability that was exploited to cause death; it was the actual mechanism causing death,\" Cahill wrote.\n\nChauvin's sentencing is scheduled for late June.

The Justice Department is now bringing criminal charges against Chauvin over allegedly violating Floyd's rights and using excessive force in restraining him.\n\nThe Justice Department has filed federal criminal charges against Derek Chauvin, accusing the former police officer of using excessive force and violating the civil rights of George Floyd. Floyd died after Chauvin pressed on his neck for more than nine minutes on the pavement outside a convenience store last year in Minneapolis.\n\nThree other former officers on the scene that day - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - have been charged federally in connection with Floyd's death. Two of the men, Kueng and Thao, are accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin. All three face a charge of failing to provide medical care with \"deliberate indifference\" to Floyd's suffering. They already are preparing for a state trial in August.\n\nChauvin also faces a separate federal indictment related to a 2017 incident where he allegedly used a neck restraint \"without legal justification\" on a 14-year-old and beat the teenager in the head with a flashlight.\n\nFederal civil rights prosecutors from Washington worked hand in hand with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota to build the case.\n\nSuch federal charges are rare, in part because it is difficult to meet the high legal bar they require. To succeed, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin acted \"willfully\" to deprive Floyd of his civil rights and used force that was \"constitutionally unreasonable.\"\n\nIn those cases, officers can argue in their defense that they acted out of fear, panic or even poor judgment, some of which featured in Chauvin's defense to state charges in a trial that concluded with a conviction on all counts last month. Chauvin has moved for a new trial , citing alleged jury misconduct and pretrial publicity.\n\nThe video of Floyd, who was Black, pleading for his life and crying for his late mother reverberated around the globe, with people who watched it taking to the streets in the summer of 2020 to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Floyd's young daughter met President Biden on the campaign trial, and he often repeats her statement that her \"daddy changed the world.\"\n\nThe case is yet another demonstration of the Biden administration's emphasis on civil rights. In the Trump administration, Attorney General Bill Barr declined to approve a plea deal with Chauvin after Floyd's death, reasoning that he preferred to cede that ground to local authorities and that the situation in Minneapolis was incendiary enough.\n\nBut the U.S. Justice Department has weighed in with federal charges in other cases, including the brutal police beating of Rodney King in California in 1991; the murder of nine Black parishioners during a Bible study at a historic church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015; and the death of a young woman protesting against hate groups in a vehicular assault in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.\n\nThe current attorney general, Merrick Garland, told ABC News he was \"shocked\" by the video of Floyd's death and saddened by the persistence of racial discrimination in housing, education and the justice system.\n\nThe new federal criminal cases are separate from an ongoing civil rights investigation Garland announced April 21 that will examine whether Minneapolis police have engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination, including excessive force and mistreatment of people with disabilities. Authorities in Minnesota have pledged to cooperate with that civil investigation, which could take months to pursue.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison welcomed the new federal criminal charges. \"The federal government has a responsibility to protect the civil rights of every American and to pursue justice to the fullest extent of federal law,\" Ellison said. \"Federal prosecution for the violation of George Floyd's civil rights is entirely appropriate.\"\n\nNAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said the charges are a \"step in the right direction\" but that \"urgent reforms\" are needed. The NAACP has been working with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on a bill named after Floyd that would create a national registry of police misconduct, among other things.\n\n\"No police officer is above the law, nor should they ever be shielded from accountability,\" Johnson said.\n\nby Vanessa Romo\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin who was convicted last month of murdering George Floyd filed court documents for a new trial on Tuesday.\n\nHis attorney, Eric Nelson, petitioned the court, alleging that Chauvin's constitutional rights were violated when Judge Peter Cahill refused to change the venue of the trial, and that the pretrial publicity deprived the officer of a fair trial.\n\nNelson also cites \"prosecutorial and jury misconduct; errors of law at trial; and a verdict that is contrary to law.\"\n\nChauvin, who jammed his knee into Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds as the Black man lay in a prone position on the ground, was convicted on one count of second-degree murder, one count of third-degree murder and one count of second-degree manslaughter.\n\nFloyd's killing, which was sparked by an initial call to police over the alleged use of a counterfeit $20 bill, was witnessed in real time in broad daylight by about a dozen people on May 25, 2020. They pleaded with Chauvin and three other Minneapolis police officers to release Floyd as he struggled to breathe. A video of the 45-year-old's death, as he cried for his mother and begged bystanders to tell his family he loved them, quickly went viral and ignited a national reckoning on police violence and systemic racism even before the trial commenced.\n\nThroughout the latest four-page court document, Nelson argues that the court abused its discretion by keeping the high-profile trial - one that became a national referendum on Black justice in America - in the same city where Floyd was killed and protests had drawn national attention.\n\nThe publicity leading up to the proceedings, Nelson said, allowed for \"intimidation of the defense's expert witnesses, from which the jury was not insulated.\" Nelson suggested that such fallout may have a long-lasting \"chilling effect\" on the ability of defendants in other high-profile cases to obtain expert witnesses in the future.\n\n\"The publicity here was so pervasive and so prejudicial before and during this trial that it amounted to a structural defect in the proceedings,\" Nelson wrote.\n\nThe blame for Chauvin's alleged unfair treatment also extended to the jury, the court and the prosecution, according to Nelson. The filing asks Cahill for a hearing to impeach the disgraced officer's verdict, in part, on the grounds that the 12 jurors \"felt threatened or intimidated, felt race-based pressure during the proceedings.\" As a result, he said, jurors were left vulnerable to intimidation and potential retribution.\n\nThe jury was significantly less white than Hennepin County itself; the 12 jurors included four Black people, two people who identify as multiracial and six white people.\n\nAccording to the motion, the court abused its discretion in the following instances:\n\nChauvin, a 19-year law enforcement veteran, is now awaiting sentencing, which could come as early as this month or sometime in June. State sentencing guidelines recommend 12.5 years in prison for a conviction on unintentional second-degree murder for someone with no criminal history. But prosecutors say they want an additional penalty, called an enhancement, because of certain aggravating factors. Ultimately, it will be Cahill's decision.\n\nIt is rare for police officers to be convicted for their conduct while wearing a uniform. As NPR's Carrie Johnson reported , \"Some studies show only seven police officers since 2005 have been convicted of murder for their actions on the job. That's even though about 1,000 or 1,100 people a year die at the hands of police.\"\n\nIt took the jury in Chauvin's case about 10 hours over a two-day period to return a guilty verdict for the white police officer.\n\nby The Associated Press\n\nIn this image from surveillance video, Minneapolis police officers (from left) Tou Thao, Derek Chauvin, J.

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are seen during the incident that killed George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Derek Chauvin's murder trial was the first Minnesota criminal trial to be broadcast live on television. It won't be the last.\n\nSome in the Minnesota legal system were apprehensive about allowing the live broadcast of Chauvin's trial in the killing of George Floyd, but the video feed had no major problems and bolstered the public's understanding of the trial, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nA spokesperson for the Hennepin County court system said an order from Judge Peter Cahill to allow the live broadcast will still apply to the August trial of the other three former Minneapolis officers charged in Floyd's death, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao.\n\nCahill ordered the trials to be broadcast live because of the intense global interest in the case and limited courthouse space because of the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota court rules usually ban cameras at criminal trials unless both sides agree to them. Although Chauvin's attorney quickly welcomed the live broadcast, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison had argued against allowing the live broadcast because he said it could intimidate witnesses.\n\nBut a week after the jury found Chauvin guilty, Ellison told WCCO-TV that the live broadcast \"went pretty well\" and that he was grateful the judge allowed juvenile witnesses to testify off camera.\n\nCahill also barred jurors' faces from being televised.\n\nHennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette said he was also a longtime skeptic of cameras in the courtroom. He met with journalists and media attorneys ahead of the trial and worked closely with Court TV, which operated the cameras and provided its video feed to other news outlets.\n\n\"Over time, I felt more comfortable that they were really interested in the integrity of the process, and worked very hard to make sure there were no violations of Judge Cahill's order,\" Barnette said.\n\nBarnette said one of the biggest benefits of televising the trial was that the public learned about the process, from jury selection to the final verdict. Chauvin was convicted last week of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He'll be sentenced June 25.\n\nby Becky Sullivan\n\nNew York Police Department officers on patrol in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan last month.

Foot patrols were increased following the mass shooting in Atlanta which killed eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.\n\nIn the days since a jury in Minneapolis convicted former police officer Derek Chauvin on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, many police officers and law enforcement organizations around the U.S. have expressed relief at the trial's outcome.\n\nAfter the video of Floyd's death went viral last May, many sought to distance themselves from Chauvin, characterizing him as one of the so-called \"bad apples\" that spoil the reputation of officers who try to do things the right way.\n\n\"As we have said from the beginning, what Derek Chauvin did that day was not policing. It was murder. The jury has spoken and he will face consequences for his actions,\" said Patrick Lynch, the president of New York City's Police Benevolent Association, in a statement released Wednesday .\n\nIn a striking repudiation of Chauvin's actions, 10 of his former colleagues at the Minneapolis Police Department testified against him during the trial, including police chief and star witness Medaria Arradondo, who said Chauvin's restraint of Floyd \"in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy.\"\n\n\"We recognize that our community is hurting, and hearts are heavy with many emotions. However, I have hope,\" said Arradondo in a statement after the verdict. \"Together, we can find our moment to begin to heal.\"\n\nBut some other police organizations - while not defending Chauvin's actions - chose to decry what they saw as politicization of the judicial process or remained silent altogether.\n\nThe Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, the union that represents officers in the Minneapolis Police Department, last summer disavowed once-member Derek Chauvin. The union has also resisted police reforms at the city and state level .\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday after the verdict, the union thanked the jury before declaring \"there are no winners in this case.\"\n\n\"We need the political pandering to stop and the race-baiting of elected officials to stop,\" the statement read. \"In addition, we need to stop the divisive comments and we all need to do better to create a Minneapolis we all love.\"\n\nThe Minneapolis police union is part of a larger statewide group called the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, whose legal defense fund is paying for Derek Chauvin's defense team.\n\nThat group told NPR it did not have any comment on the verdict. It also declined to share any information about how much it has spent so far. The case is not yet wrapped; Chauvin is due to be sentenced in eight weeks, and an appeal is likely to follow.\n\nReform efforts riven by disagreement\n\nThe trial and verdict have renewed calls for structural changes to policing, both around the U.S. and in the Twin Cities region, where the funeral of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man shot by police while resisting arrest as the Chauvin trial was underway, is taking place today.\n\n\"What if we just prevented the problem instead of having to try these cases?\" said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison after the verdict Tuesday. \"We don't want any more community members dying at the hands of law enforcement and their families' lives ruined. We don't want any more law enforcement members having to face criminal charges and their families' lives ruined.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday it will investigate possible patterns of discrimination and excessive force among the Minneapolis Police Department, an inquiry Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told NPR he \"welcomes.\"\n\n\"I believe strongly that it's an opportunity to continue working towards that deep change and accountability that we know that we need in the Minneapolis department,\" Frey said.\n\nEven as many states passed reform legislation last summer, including Minnesota , police reform remains a complicated endeavor due to the decentralized nature of law enforcement in the U.S.\n\nThere are more than 18,000 independent law enforcement agencies, some with thousands of sworn officers and many more with just a handful.\n\n\"The federal government doesn't have authority to dictate how local law enforcement is provided, but they can certainly incentivize local law enforcement to follow standards or models,\" said Sue Rahr, the former King County, Wash., sheriff who is soon retiring as head of Washington state's police training commission.\n\nA wide-ranging police reform bill bearing George Floyd's name passed the U.S. House of Representatives last month. For federal law enforcement officers, it would ban chokeholds, no-knock warrants and racial and religious profiling, and put an end to qualified immunity. The bill would also encourage states to follow suit by making those bans a condition of federal aid.\n\nBut its prospects in the Senate, where it needs the support of at least 10 Republicans to overcome a filibuster, are uncertain .\n\n\"One of the things I say to [Republicans] is that until policing is transformed in the United States, don't be surprised if police continue to have a reputation that becomes worse and worse every time one of these incidents is happening,\" said Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., and the bill's sponsor in the House, in an interview with NPR .\n\nBass is working with Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of only three Republican African Americans in Congress. Scott, who proposed a Republican alternative last year that failed due to Democratic opposition, told reporters Wednesday that the group is \"on the verge of wrapping this up in the next week or two.\"\n\n\"We have a moment in time right now, and we need to seize that moment, take this and get it across the finish line,\" said Bass.\n\nNPR's Martin Kaste contributed reporting.\n\nby Jason Breslow\n\nVanita Gupta appears during her confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Alex Brandon/AP hide caption\n\nVanita Gupta appears during her confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate voted to confirm Gupta as associate attorney general in a 51-49 vote.\n\nThe Senate on Wednesday narrowly voted to confirm Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general, elevating a longtime civil rights attorney to the third-highest position inside the Justice Department on the same day the agency announced renewed efforts to monitor local police practices.\n\nGupta was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 49 , with only one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, breaking ranks to join Democrats in approving her nomination.\n\nWith her confirmation, Gupta, 46, will become the first woman of color in Justice Department history to serve as associate attorney general - a role in which she will oversee the department's civil rights litigation as well as its antitrust, civil and environment divisions.\n\nSpeaking from the Senate floor Wednesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Gupta's confirmation \"very good news for the forces of equality and justice in the country.\"\n\n\"Not only is Ms. Gupta the first woman of color to ever be nominated to the position, she is the first civil rights attorney ever to be nominated to the position,\" Schumer said. \"That's shocking, really. We never have had a former civil rights attorney serving in such a position of prominence at the Justice Department.\"\n\nWednesday's vote marked the culmination of a contentious confirmation process for Gupta, who nearly saw her nomination derailed by Republicans over her advocacy for progressive policies as well as her past criticism of former President Donald Trump during her time as head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing, Gupta apologized for any \"harsh rhetoric\" she has used against Republicans but nonetheless struggled to win GOP support. In remarks ahead of the vote, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced he would oppose Gupta, saying she had \"levied attacks on members of this body\" and \"amplified left-wing fear-mongering toward judicial nominees and sitting federal judges.\"\n\nAt the time of her hearing, Gupta had also been targeted by five Republican state attorneys general as well as a nearly $1 million negative advertising campaign launched by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. Much of the criticism centered on Gupta's work at the Justice Department during the Obama administration, when she oversaw investigations of police departments after white officers shot and killed Black citizens - including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nExplaining her party-breaking support for Gupta, Alaska's Murkowski said that while some of the nominee's past remarks troubled her, she was ultimately swayed by a lengthy conversation with Gupta.\n\n\"I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who I believe has demonstrated throughout her professional career to be deeply, deeply committed to matters of justice,\" Murkowski said.\n\nGupta won similar praise during her confirmation from the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest law enforcement union. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the group's president called Gupta a \"strong defender of civil rights\" and said she \"always worked with us to find common ground even when that seemed impossible.\"\n\nGupta will return to the Justice Department at a moment when it is recommitting itself to increased federal oversight of police departments.\n\nFollowing Tuesday's guilty verdict against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd, Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday announced an investigation into possible patterns of discrimination and excessive force by the city's police force.\n\nThe announcement marked the Biden administration's first such \"pattern or practice\" investigation - a tool used more than two dozen times by the Obama administration but just once under Trump.\n\nGupta is expected to play a leading role in the department's work to police the police. Addressing the verdict against Chauvin on Tuesday, President Biden said Gupta had spent her entire career \"fighting to advance racial equity and justice,\" saying she had \"the experience and the skill necessary to advance our administration's priorities to root out unconstitutional policing and reform our criminal justice system.\"\n\nby Mary Louise Kelly , Mano Sundaresan\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was met with boos from protestors in his city last summer after saying he didn't support abolishing the police.

Now, the city council is mulling giving voters an option on the ballot this November to replace the police department outright with a new entity based around public health.\n\nWhile Frey doesn't see eye to eye with advocates of the #DefundThePolice movement, he was forthright about the need to significantly reform the police and Minneapolis at large.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn your view has there been a pattern of unlawful, unconstitutional policing in Minneapolis?\n\nWe've certainly had issues in our Minneapolis Police Department, like many other police departments throughout our country. And now I feel like we've reached a point when people are pushing very clearly for change. We're making sure that the precision of our actions right now match the precision of the harm that has been inflicted over quite some time. And let's be clear, we've got a mandate right now for that change. These cycles of trauma and tragedy, they're not going to interrupt themselves, so we need to act.\n\nLet's stay with the changes that you would like to see happen. What are your prioritizing?\n\nThere have been a litany of changes that have already taken place. There are also more changes that are underway and that need to happen. Our Black community continues to demand these changes of the highest order. And that's everything from the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act at the federal level, that's state law changes and we need safety beyond policing as well. Noting that not every single 911 one call needs response from an officer with a gun.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council is working to give voters an option on the ballot to eliminate the police department. Now in past you have not supported moves like that. Where are you now?\n\nI very much support a comprehensive strategy to public safety that includes the aspects that I just talked about, whether it's a mental health co-responder approach or social workers or individuals that have experience working with those experiencing homelessness. That's important and that doesn't need to have response from an officer. The part where we diverge is twofold. One, I do not believe we should be defunding/abolishing the police department in a way that we would be significantly reducing the already very low number of officers that we have on a per capita basis in Minneapolis. And two, I don't support a move that would have the head of public safety or the chief of police report to 14 individuals. I believe that that diminishes accountability and it clearly diminishes the ability to provide clear direction.\n\nHow are you thinking about helping your city heal?\n\nOur city has gone through a barrage of trauma over this last year, in many respects culminating in the trial and the verdict that we just saw yesterday. This is a moment perhaps centuries in the making - a centuries in the making reckoning around racial justice. And also, I want to note that we don't want to shortchange that moment in a way that we limit the conversations to simply aspects of policing. The conversation needs to be about economic inclusion. It needs to be about rights in housing. We need to be making clear moves towards racial equity in every shape and form, towards justice and to healing. And that can't simply focus on policy reforms and policing itself. Of course, that's part of it. But we need to go well beyond.\n\nKaren Zamora, Elena Burnett and Courtney Dorning produced and edited the audio interview.

Stephen Maturen/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPeople celebrate at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis after the guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder trial on Tuesday.\n\nThe murder conviction of Derek Chauvin could represent \"a huge paradigm shift,\" if three other Minneapolis officers charged in George Floyd's death are also convicted, says Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and activist in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Before yesterday's verdict, Minnesota officers had been sent the message that they could take a Black life and that there would not be any real accountability under the law, which makes it dangerous for Black people and other people of color,\" Armstrong said Wednesday in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition .\n\nAlong with the charges against Kim Potter, a Brooklyn Center Police Department veteran who killed Daunte Wright , \"that is a huge paradigm shift,\"  if all of those officers \"wind up being convicted,\" Armstrong said. \"It would have been unimaginable just even a month ago that something like that was possible.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement about the fact that what we would call a killer cop is finally convicted,\" she said.\n\nArmstrong said \"this did not happen because the system worked. This happened because the people put in the work. At every hand, we had to press for the officers to be fired, for them to be charged, for there to be more serious charges and things like that.\"\n\nShe's not sure that Chauvin's conviction will set a precedent for how police behave in the future.\n\n\"It remains to be seen as to how the system will respond when an officer shoots someone or has to make a split-second decision versus the circumstances of this case,\" Armstrong said.\n\nIn a separate Morning Edition interview , Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Floyd family, said, \"The system worked because the people put in work. And when something has a bright light shined upon it, it functions properly.\"\n\nBystander video of Floyd's murder on a Minneapolis street made all the difference in bringing attention to his death, Stewart said. \"Normally I say justice by video is the only way that African Americans ever, you know, get prosecutions in this type of case. ...\"\n\n\"If there were no videos, if there were no bystanders screaming, 'Get off him.' If no one was paying attention, we never would have heard of this case. ... The world wouldn't have made it go viral,\" Stewart said.\n\nStewart also represented the family of Walter Scott , a Black man whose fatal shooting in 2015 by a white police officer in North Charleston, S.C., also was captured on video. Stewart says the pandemic helped raise the focus on Floyd's death.\n\nCoverage of Scott's death \"was huge,\" Stewart recalls. \"It was worldwide for about a month. And then people moved on. You know, you got back to work. You got back to your family. You got back to life. But when George Floyd happened, we were all trapped in our homes. You couldn't move on. You know, there was no going to work. There was no leaving the house. And so people that normally wouldn't care about the death of some Black man in Minnesota cared.\"\n\nStewart says that proper policing and caring about how police treat people of color are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\"Because you want to hold an officer accountable does not mean you're against policing ...\" he said. \"We've been pushed that you have to choose a side, which is pure stupidity. You know, you can support good policing and you can support victims that don't look like you.\"\n\nMilton Guevara, Arezou Rezvani and Scott Saloway produced and edited the audio versions of this story.

Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks alongside members of the Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday following the verdict against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd.\n\nWith the verdict against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin now in for the murder of George Floyd , attention is turning to Congress and whether lawmakers can meet the growing demand from across the nation for meaningful changes to policing.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the guilty verdict appeared to add a new sense of urgency around talks on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House of Representatives in early March , but seven weeks later remains bogged down in the Senate.\n\nThe legislation would ban chokeholds and end qualified immunity for law enforcement - the legal protection for police officers that limits victims' ability to sue for misconduct. It would ban no-knock warrants in federal drug cases, mandate data collection on police encounters and create a nationwide police misconduct registry to help hold problematic officers accountable. The bill would also prohibit racial and religious profiling and redirect funding to community-based policing programs.\n\nThe bill passed the House by a 220-212 vote, mostly along party lines. But it has faced an uphill climb in the Senate, where Republicans have sought to revive a competing plan by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., designed to diminish the use of chokeholds - but not ban them outright - and increase federal reporting requirements for use of force and no-knock warrants. Democrats blocked the plan last June, saying it did not go far enough to address racial inequality.\n\nIn the wake of the Chauvin trial, lawmakers from both parties are saying they want to see action on policing, but the path ahead seems far from certain. While Democrats technically hold the Senate majority, they would need 60 votes (all of the Democratic caucus plus 10 Republicans) to overcome a potential filibuster and pass legislation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday after the verdict was announced, Rep. Karen Bass, who first introduced the House bill in the last Congress, said informal discussions were taking place between Democrats and Senate Republicans, but the California Democrat said she \"would not call it negotiation.\"\n\nBass has said she would like to see a bill reach President Biden's desk by the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death on May 25, though it remains unclear whether Democrats will be able to secure the Republican votes they would need to reach that target.\n\n\"I am hopeful because I'm working with Sen. Scott, and Sen. Scott has received the blessing of his caucus,\" Bass said in an interview Wednesday with NPR's All Things Considered. \"I believe that if he is supportive of the bill, that we will be able to round up the Republican senators that we need.\"\n\nScott, who has been leading talks for Republicans, expressed cautious optimism about reaching a deal on Wednesday, saying, \"I think we are on the verge of wrapping this up in the next week or two.\"\n\nOne of the major sticking points has been qualified immunity, an issue that Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, said he was working to resolve with Bass; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and other Democrats.\n\n\"There is a way to put more of the onus or the burden on the department, or on the employer, than on the employee,\" Scott said. \"I think that is a logical step forward and one that as I've spoken with Karen Bass over the last several weeks is something that the Democrats are quite receptive to.\"\n\nHe said other outstanding issues include how the legislation would deal with chokeholds and no-knock warrants.\n\nUnlike last summer, when talks stalled in Congress, Democrats now hold the majority in the Senate and have a crucial ally in the White House. In a televised address to the nation after Tuesday's verdict, Biden said it was time for Congress to act.\n\n\"George Floyd was murdered almost a year ago,\" Biden said. \"There's meaningful police reform legislation in his name ... legislation to tackle systemic misconduct in police departments, to restore trust between law enforcement and the people they're entrusted to serve and protect. But it shouldn't take a whole year to get this done.\"\n\nBiden said he told the Floyd family that the White House would continue to fight for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but his administration has faced criticism for failing to detail his efforts to secure its passage.\n\nAsked Wednesday about the president's role in the negotiations, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden plans to use his address to a joint session of Congress next week \"as an opportunity to elevate this issue and talk about the importance of putting police reform measures in place.\" Psaki also said the administration has been in direct conversation with leaders in Congress as well as with civil rights leaders who are advocating for the bill.\n\n\"But I will also say that there are times, and this is true in diplomacy, but also true in legislating, that ... the best strategy is to provide the space for those conversations to happen privately, and that's part of our objective,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday announced the opening of an investigation by the Justice Department into possible patterns of discrimination and use of excessive force by the Minneapolis Police Department -  the first such \"pattern or practice\" investigation in the Biden administration.\n\nby Bill Chappell\n\nDerek Chauvin, seen here in a booking photo, faces sentencing in June.

Minnesota Department of Corrections via AP hide caption\n\nDerek Chauvin, seen here in a booking photo, faces sentencing in June. The former Minneapolis police officer was convicted of murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death.\n\nWith Derek Chauvin found guilty of murder, attention now turns to his sentencing - and to the trial of three fellow former police officers who are accused of aiding and abetting Chauvin, who is white, in the killing of George Floyd, who was Black.\n\nTuesday's verdict is being hailed by activists who urge more accountability for police, particularly in officers' use of violent and deadly force against people of color.\n\nHere's a look at what's next in the Minneapolis case:\n\nChauvin's likely prison sentence\n\nChauvin is scheduled to be sentenced in June after a jury found him guilty of all three charges Tuesday. In Minnesota, a person convicted of multiple crimes that happened at the same time is typically only sentenced for the most severe charge. In this case, that would be second-degree murder (unintentional) while committing a felony.\n\nState guidelines recommend that Chauvin be sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison for second-degree murder, given his lack of prior criminal history. But he could face a longer prison term if prosecutors successfully argue that aggravating factors - such as Chauvin's position of authority and Floyd's killing in front of a dozen witnesses - require greater punishment.\n\nThe maximum prison term for second-degree unintentional murder is 40 years, although the state's sentencing guidelines for second-degree unintentional murder largely taper off at 24 years.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill, who has authority to sentence Chauvin above or below the guidelines, will take the first step in establishing the range of Chauvin's prison sentence in two weeks. He'll consider both sides' arguments over whether aggravating factors call for an \"upward departure\" in sentencing. Those arguments will be made in writing. The former police officer will be sentenced about six weeks later.\n\nUnder Minnesota law, people sentenced to prison become eligible to be considered for parole after serving two-thirds of their sentence , providing they've had no disciplinary problems in prison.\n\nKueng, Lane and Thao face trial\n\nThe trial of three other former police officers who were involved in Floyd's death is set to begin on Aug. 23 in the same Hennepin County government building where Chauvin was tried.\n\nThe former officers - J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao - will be tried together. The state has charged them each with two counts of aiding and abetting - one for second-degree murder and one for second-degree manslaughter.\n\nAll the former officers would face the same maximum penalty of 40 years in prison if they're found guilty of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder. A guilty verdict on aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter would expose them to a maximum of 10 years in prison, according to court documents in the case.\n\nKueng , Lane and Thao were fired along with Chauvin one day after Floyd died last Memorial Day. Soon afterward, prosecutors leveled criminal charges against the four.\n\nAt the time of Floyd's death, Chauvin was by far the most experienced officer of the group, with 19 years on the force. He also held the status of a field training officer.\n\nKueng, 27, and Lane, 38, were the first officers to respond to the Cup Foods store in southern Minneapolis after a report came in that someone had used a suspected counterfeit $20 bill to make a purchase. Thao, 35, then arrived with Chauvin.\n\nA small crowd watched as the officers struggled to put Floyd into a police vehicle and then restrained him in the street, holding him facedown on the asphalt for nine minutes and 29 seconds. Video from the scene, with Floyd pleading for his life, set off outrage and months of protests over police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nPolice department under scrutiny\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a federal investigation into \"whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing.\"\n\nThe guilty verdict in Chauvin's case \"does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis,\" Garland said.\n\nThe attorney general said the civil inquiry will review allegations of excessive force by Minneapolis police officers. The scope of the inquiry will also include police actions during the months of protests that followed Floyd's death.\n\n\"If the Justice Department concludes that there's reasonable cause to believe there is a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing, we will issue a public report of our conclusions,\" Garland said.\n\nIn addition to the new probe, the Justice Department is already conducting a civil rights investigation into Floyd's death.\n\nMinneapolis police Chief Medaria Arradondo and other senior police officials testified against Chauvin during the former officer's trial, saying his actions went against departmental policies and training.\n\nby Rachel Treisman\n\nAn image from a police body camera shows bystanders outside Cup Foods in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020.

Minneapolis Police Department via AP hide caption\n\nAn image from a police body camera shows bystanders outside Cup Foods in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. The group includes Darnella Frazier, third from right, as she made a 10-minute recording of George Floyd's death.\n\nThe Black teenager who recorded the now-infamous video of Derek Chauvin pressing his knee on George Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes last May is being hailed as a hero following the former Minneapolis police officer's conviction on murder and manslaughter charges.\n\nDarnella Frazier, who was 17 at the time, testified during the trial that she has spent nights apologizing to Floyd for \"not doing more.\" Now, people across the country - including Floyd's family, President Biden and numerous celebrities and elected officials - are crediting her bravery and quick thinking in capturing the video that they say made the guilty verdict possible.\n\nAfter the jury convicted Chauvin of all three charges, Frazier shared a post on social media expressing her relief and thanking God. \"Justice has been served,\" she added.\n\nA post shared by Darnella 🌷(@darnella_frazier03)\n\nFrazier had been taking her 9-year-old cousin to Cup Foods last Memorial Day when she saw police officers holding Floyd on the asphalt near the rear of a police vehicle, a scene she described during her testimony as that of \"a man terrified, scared, begging for his life.\"\n\nShe sent her cousin inside the store and began filming. The 10-minute video she posted to Facebook has since been seen by millions and became a central piece of evidence in Chauvin's trial.\n\n\"When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, my brothers, my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black,\" Frazier said from the witness stand . \"I look at how that could have been one of them.\"\n\nThe graphic video captured a scene drastically at odds with the initial police statement, which described the encounter as: \"man dies after medical incident during police interaction.\" It said that Floyd physically resisted officers and made no mention of the prolonged restraint.\n\nIf Darnella Frazier hadn't filmed what happened and uploaded it to social media, where would this case be? #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/PUjbh6aNKD\n\nMany social media users and public figures are praising Frazier for taking the video, which they credit with disproving the police narrative and facilitating the trial's historic outcome.\n\nPolice officers are rarely convicted of murder for on-duty killings, and Chauvin is just the second such case in Minnesota's history.\n\nIn remarks delivered Tuesday, Biden also noted how rare such a verdict is and said Chauvin's conviction seems for many people to have been the result of \"a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors\" - including \"a brave young woman with a smartphone camera.\"\n\nAngela Harrelson, Floyd's aunt, lauded Frazier's bravery in a Wednesday interview with CNN.\n\n\"It really doesn't surprise me that much, with police cover-ups, because they've always had done that, especially towards Black and brown people,\" Harrelson said. \"The sad thing is if it hadn't been for that 17-year-old girl Darnella, it would have been another Black man, that was killed by the police, his own fault, and they would have said, 'Oh, it was drugs, oh it was this.' And we would never have had the story we would have and wouldn't be here today talking.\"\n\nOscar-winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a tweet that Frazier had changed the world, adding, \"No film in our time has been more important than yours.\" Journalist Ann Marie Lipinski called it \"one of the most important civil rights documents in a generation.\"\n\nSome have called for Frazier to receive the Pulitzer Prize for photojournalism. Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, Minn., wrote , \"What work of media has been more consequential in the past year?\"\n\n\"She is a stellar example of how everyday people can be powerful in documenting injustice and creating momentum for accountability,\" tweeted Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.\n\nHistory should remember the incredibly 17 year old Darnella Frazier who had the strength and composure to capture the murder of #georgefloyd on video.   Without her video there may never have been #justice .\n\nFrazier has received one award already - from PEN America, the nonprofit organization focused on freedom of expression. The legendary producer, director and screenwriter Spike Lee presented Frazier with an award for courage at a virtual ceremony in December.\n\n\"She documented the murder of George Floyd, our brother. King Floyd. And that footage reverberated around this God's earth, and people took to the streets all over this Earth,\" Lee said. \"Not just the United States of America, and it wasn't just Black people either.\"\n\nAt the ceremony, a slew of high-profile figures - including actors Gabrielle Union and Meryl Streep, civil rights activists DeRay Mckesson and Anita Hill, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. - offered their praise and thanks in a series of brief video clips.\n\n\"I never would imagine out of my whole 17 years of living that this will be me,\" Frazier said as she accepted the award. \"It's just a lot to take in, but I couldn't say 'thank you' enough for everything that's been coming towards me.\"\n\nIn the wake of the trial, supporters of Frazier are expressing their gratitude as well as their hopes that she will continue to receive support.\n\nFrazier testified that she felt like she was in danger at the time and that police were threatening bystanders with Mace as they called for officers to stop hurting Floyd and render medical attention.\n\nMany have noted that the experience and resulting trauma will stay with her permanently.\n\nBernice King, CEO of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, posted a tweet wishing \"emotional healing\" for Frazier, while journalist Evette Dionne offered prayers for the safety of Frazier and other bystanders who \"now have a city police department's bullseye on their back.\"\n\nOthers are sharing the link to an online fundraiser titled \"Peace and Healing for Darnella Fund,\" which was created last May and has raised more than $630,000 as of midday Wednesday.\n\n\"In addition to the trauma of watching a black man be murdered by police, she has had to deal with trolls, bullies and ignorant people harassing her online,\" organizers wrote. \"It took unbelievable courage for her to stand there and bear witness to such an awful tragedy. We all have our roles to play in the revolution against white supremacy. Darnella played an important one and should be uplifted, not shamed.\"\n\nIn an update on Tuesday, organizer Mica Cole Kamenski said that while the fundraiser had originally been established to support Frazier's immediate healing and well-being, contributors wanted to provide the financial resources to ensure her long-term safety and that proceeds from the fundraiser will be transferred to a trust in Frazier's name.\n\nKamenski added that \"because of Darnella Frazier, we saw a glimpse of accountability today.\"\n\n\"The support I had since day one carried me a long way,\" Frazier wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. \"So thank you all again, thank you.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "4 years since George Floyd's death, the Minneapolis police force has made some changes\n\nBy\n\nJon Collins\n\n,\n\nScott Simon\n\nA conversation from Minneapolis about what's changed and what's not since George Floyd was killed by police officers four years ago.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: It has been four years to the day since a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for more than nine minutes and killed him. The horrific scene was captured on a bystander video, and George Floyd's death sparked outrage and calls for police reform across the country. Minnesota Public Radio reporter Jon Collins joins us now from Minneapolis. Jon, thanks so much for being with us. JON COLLINS, BYLINE: Thanks so much for having me. SIMON: How have the Minneapolis Police, at least so far, been held accountable? COLLINS: You know, the main thing that's happened is prosecutions. That's the four officers that were involved in George Floyd's killing. They were either convicted or pleaded guilty to both federal and state charges, with, of course, Derek Chauvin, who was the officer who placed his knee on Floyd's neck, now serving more than 20 years. And these prosecutions were very significant because charges against officers for using lethal force are pretty rare in the United States, and then convictions are even rarer. So these convictions were a big win for prosecutors and then for members of the public who really pushed for these former officers to be charged in Floyd's death. SIMON: Minneapolis Police were also investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. Where do these investigations stand? COLLINS: Both of these investigations found glaring issues with the Minneapolis Police Department. On the state side, the city and state Department of Human Rights negotiated a court-enforced agreement that requires all sorts of changes to the policies and practices of the Minneapolis Police. So that's everything from training to crowd control to officer wellness. And I spoke to Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero, and she says the city has made progress setting up the foundation for really systemic change, but there's a long way to go. REBECCA LUCERO: There is so much hunger for community members to see really big substantive changes. And there's this urgency around that because we know lives are at stake here. And to get there, it takes a lot of really important, small steps. COLLINS: And the separate federal consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice has not yet been finalized, but that's expected very soon here. So that would make Minneapolis the first city in the country to be under both state and federal consent decrees on policing at the same time. SIMON: Jon, what are some of the other changes that Minneapolis has made? COLLINS: Yeah, Minneapolis has totally revamped its public safety structure. They hired a commissioner for the first time. A new chief came in. Just recently, they also announced plans to create a new early intervention system. So they say they'll use data to track police officers who seem to be in trouble or on a troubled path and intervene before something tragic happens. And another high point has been the expansion of the city's behavioral crisis response teams. So people in Minneapolis can now call 911 in nonviolent situations, and unarmed mental health responders are going to show up to help. So Minneapolis appears to be investing in the sort of public safety efforts that do not require armed police, which is what a lot of folks were calling for way back in 2020. SIMON: And how are the city and the police department still contending with some of the other consequences of what happened to George Floyd in 2020? COLLINS: The Minneapolis Police Department lost a ton of officers after Floyd's death. So officials say they want to bring on more young, more diverse candidates who also live in or have roots in the city of Minneapolis. Chief Brian O'Hara said they're turning the corner on staffing, but they're not there yet. And then finally, there's the question of what happens to the Third Precinct building, which was famously set on fire during these protests. It's been closed off. It's been surrounded by barbed wire and concrete since not long after Floyd's killing, and it's really become a symbol to the community and also a reminder of what happened to Floyd. There are some proposals, but, tellingly, four years later, it's still not clear what's going to take the place of the precinct. SIMON: Reporter Jon Collins of Minnesota Public Radio, thanks so much.

On the state side, the city and state Department of Human Rights negotiated a court-enforced agreement that requires all sorts of changes to the policies and practices of the Minneapolis Police. So that's everything from training to crowd control to officer wellness. And I spoke to Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero, and she says the city has made progress setting up the foundation for really systemic change, but there's a long way to go. REBECCA LUCERO: There is so much hunger for community members to see really big substantive changes. And there's this urgency around that because we know lives are at stake here. And to get there, it takes a lot of really important, small steps. COLLINS: And the separate federal consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice has not yet been finalized, but that's expected very soon here. So that would make Minneapolis the first city in the country to be under both state and federal consent decrees on policing at the same time. SIMON: Jon, what are some of the other changes that Minneapolis has made? COLLINS: Yeah, Minneapolis has totally revamped its public safety structure. They hired a commissioner for the first time. A new chief came in. Just recently, they also announced plans to create a new early intervention system. So they say they'll use data to track police officers who seem to be in trouble or on a troubled path and intervene before something tragic happens. And another high point has been the expansion of the city's behavioral crisis response teams. So people in Minneapolis can now call 911 in nonviolent situations, and unarmed mental health responders are going to show up to help. So Minneapolis appears to be investing in the sort of public safety efforts that do not require armed police, which is what a lot of folks were calling for way back in 2020. SIMON: And how are the city and the police department still contending with some of the other consequences of what happened to George Floyd in 2020? COLLINS: The Minneapolis Police Department lost a ton of officers after Floyd's death. So officials say they want to bring on more young, more diverse candidates who also live in or have roots in the city of Minneapolis. Chief Brian O'Hara said they're turning the corner on staffing, but they're not there yet. And then finally, there's the question of what happens to the Third Precinct building, which was famously set on fire during these protests. It's been closed off. It's been surrounded by barbed wire and concrete since not long after Floyd's killing, and it's really become a symbol to the community and also a reminder of what happened to Floyd. There are some proposals, but, tellingly, four years later, it's still not clear what's going to take the place of the precinct. SIMON: Reporter Jon Collins of Minnesota Public Radio, thanks so much.

COLLINS: You know, the main thing that's happened is prosecutions. That's the four officers that were involved in George Floyd's killing. They were either convicted or pleaded guilty to both federal and state charges, with, of course, Derek Chauvin, who was the officer who placed his knee on Floyd's neck, now serving more than 20 years. And these prosecutions were very significant because charges against officers for using lethal force are pretty rare in the United States, and then convictions are even rarer. So these convictions were a big win for prosecutors and then for members of the public who really pushed for these former officers to be charged in Floyd's death.

There are some proposals, but, tellingly, four years later, it's still not clear what's going to take the place of the precinct. SIMON: Reporter Jon Collins of Minnesota Public Radio, thanks so much.

And there's this urgency around that because we know lives are at stake here. And to get there, it takes a lot of really important, small steps. COLLINS: And the separate federal consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice has not yet been finalized, but that's expected very soon here. So that would make Minneapolis the first city in the country to be under both state and federal consent decrees on policing at the same time. SIMON: Jon, what are some of the other changes that Minneapolis has made? COLLINS: Yeah, Minneapolis has totally revamped its public safety structure. They hired a commissioner for the first time. A new chief came in. Just recently, they also announced plans to create a new early intervention system. So they say they'll use data to track police officers who seem to be in trouble or on a troubled path and intervene before something tragic happens. And another high point has been the expansion of the city's behavioral crisis response teams. So people in Minneapolis can now call 911 in nonviolent situations, and unarmed mental health responders are going to show up to help. So Minneapolis appears to be investing in the sort of public safety efforts that do not require armed police, which is what a lot of folks were calling for way back in 2020. SIMON: And how are the city and the police department still contending with some of the other consequences of what happened to George Floyd in 2020? COLLINS: The Minneapolis Police Department lost a ton of officers after Floyd's death. So officials say they want to bring on more young, more diverse candidates who also live in or have roots in the city of Minneapolis. Chief Brian O'Hara said they're turning the corner on staffing, but they're not there yet. And then finally, there's the question of what happens to the Third Precinct building, which was famously set on fire during these protests. It's been closed off.

      "text": "Three ex-Minneapolis police officers guilty of violating George Floyd's civil rights\n\nBecky Sullivan\n\nFrom left to right, former Minneapolis police officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao provided by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office in Minnesota on June 3, 2020. Hennepin County Sheriff's Office/AP hide caption\n\nFrom left to right, former Minneapolis police officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao provided by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office in Minnesota on June 3, 2020.\n\nA federal jury found three former Minneapolis police officers guilty of depriving George Floyd of his civil rights when they helped with the restraint that led to his death.\n\nThe jury found that Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao all deprived Floyd of his right to medical care, and that two of them failed to intervene as Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe three former officers each faced federal civil rights charges over their conduct on May 25, 2020, when they joined Derek Chauvin in holding Floyd to the ground for about nine minutes and keeping bystanders away.\n\n\"Today's verdict recognizes that two police officers violated the Constitution by failing to intervene to stop another officer from killing George Floyd, and three officers violated the Constitution by failing to provide aid to Mr. Floyd in time to prevent his death,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement .\n\n\"The Justice Department will continue to seek accountability for law enforcement officers whose actions, or failure to act, violate their constitutional duty to protect the civil rights of our citizens. George Floyd should be alive today,\" he added.\n\nPhilonese Floyd, George's brother, called it a good but sad day, according to Minnesota Public Radio .\n\n\"This is just accountability,\" Philonese Floyd said after the convictions. \"It can never be justice because I can never get George back. I can't get my brother back.\"\n\nLane and Kueng were the first officers on the scene after workers at the Cup Foods convenience store called 911 to report that someone had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. As the two confronted and handcuffed Floyd, they were joined by Thao and Chauvin. Chauvin was the most senior officer present.\n\nAfter officers struggled to place Floyd into a squad car, three restrained Floyd on the ground for about nine minutes as bystanders begged them to stop. Floyd was later pronounced dead.\n\nIt was Chauvin who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. He was convicted of murder in a state trial last year, and in December he pleaded guilty to a single charge of violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nInstead, this federal civil rights trial - the second of what will likely be three total trials over Floyd's death - focused on the actions of the other three ex-officers, all of whom assisted in the deadly restraint: Lane held Floyd's legs down, Kueng knelt on Floyd's back, and Thao stopped bystanders from intervening.\n\nAll three were charged with willfully and without due process depriving Floyd of his right to liberty. Prosecutors say the former officers saw that Floyd needed medical care but failed to provide it. Thao and Kueng each faced an additional charge of willfully depriving Floyd of his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure when they failed to intervene to stop Chauvin.\n\n\"They chose not to intervene, they chose not to aid George Floyd as the window to save Mr. Floyd's life slammed shut,\" prosecutor Manda Sertich told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday. \"This is a crime.\"\n\nThe statutory maximum sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights resulting in his death is life in prison.\n\nA sentencing date has not yet been scheduled.\n\nProsecutors faced the challenge of convincing the jury that the three officers had \"willfully\" deprived Floyd of his civil rights, a legal standard that has often served as a high bar in civil rights prosecutions.\n\nThey focused on the officers' training, saying the officers knew they had a duty to provide medical care and that they had been trained to turn handcuffed suspects on their side to allow for breathing. A training expert for the Minneapolis Police Department had testified that officers were trained to intervene if they witnessed a fellow officer using excessive force.\n\nOf the three defendants, Lane appeared to have the strongest defense, legal observers agreed. Lane twice asked if they should turn Floyd onto his side so he could breathe, but he was rebuffed by both Chauvin and Kueng. Lane also called for an ambulance and body camera footage shows that he later assisted paramedics in their attempt to resuscitate Floyd.\n\n\"Even though he recognized and even gave voice to the mortal danger George Floyd was in, he did nothing to give George Floyd the medical aid he knew that Mr. Floyd so desperately needed,\" Sertich said Tuesday. \"When the need was the greatest, he did the least.\"\n\nLawyers representing the ex-officers argued that their training had not been sufficient and that they were following the lead of Chauvin, the senior officer on scene. Lane and Kueng were both rookies, a fact their lawyers turned to repeatedly.\n\n\"I'm not trying to say he wasn't trained,\" said Thomas Plunkett, a defense lawyer representing Kueng. \"I'm saying the training was inadequate to help him see, perceive and understand what was happening here.\"\n\nLane's attorney Earl Gray criticized the prosecution and blamed \"mob rule and politics\" for the trial.\n\nThe three ex-officers also face state charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All three have pleaded not guilty. That trial is scheduled to begin on June 13.\n\nChauvin's state trial took place last year, and he was convicted of murdering Floyd . He is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence .

      "text": "Two former police officers are sentenced for violating George Floyd's civil rights\n\nBy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nFormer Minneapolis Police Officer Tou Thao (left) was sentenced to 3 1/2 years and J. Alexander Kueng got three years Wednesday for violating George Floyd's civil rights. Hennepin County Sheriff's Office via AP hide caption\n\nFormer Minneapolis Police Officer Tou Thao (left) was sentenced to 3 1/2 years and J. Alexander Kueng got three years Wednesday for violating George Floyd's civil rights.\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. - The last two former Minneapolis police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd's civil rights during his May 2020 killing were sentenced Wednesday in federal court to three and 3 1/2 years - penalties that a judge said reflected their level of culpability in a case that sparked worldwide protests as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nJ. Alexander Kueng was sentenced to three years and Tou Thao got 3 1/2 years. They were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd's civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Derek Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes.\n\nAs Chauvin pinned Floyd's neck, Kueng held Floyd's back, Officer Thomas Lane held his feet and Thao kept bystanders back during the killing, which was recorded by bystanders.\n\nThe federal government brought the civil rights charges against all four officers in May 2021, a month after Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court. They were seen as an affirmation of the Justice Department's priorities to address racial inequities in policing, a promise made by President Joe Biden before his election. And they came just a week after federal prosecutors brought hate crimes charges in the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and announced two sweeping probes into policing in two states.\n\nKueng and Thao were convicted in February of two counts of violating Floyd's civil rights. The jury found they deprived the 46-year-old Black man of medical care and failed to stop Chauvin. Kueng, who is Black, was sentenced to three years on each count, to be served concurrently.\n\nThe lower sentence for Kueng and Thao raise questions about whether he would consider a plea deal or risk a state court trial on Oct. 24, when they face counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nChauvin, who pleaded guilty last year to violating Floyd's civil rights and the civil rights of a teenager in an unrelated case, was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. Lane, who twice asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side so he could breathe, was convicted of one count and was sentenced last week to 2 1/2 - a sentence Floyd's brother Philonise called \"insulting.\"\n\nKueng and Thao got a victory last week when Magnuson issued rulings that affected how their federal sentences would be calculated. The rulings - particularly one that cross-references their crimes with involuntary manslaughter instead of murder - meant the men headed into Wednesday's hearings with a recommended range of 4 1/4 years to 5 1/4 years. They might have faced a life sentence.\n\nMark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, said ahead of the hearings that Kueng and Thao would likely seek a plea deal on the state charges that won't exceed the federal sentence and will let them serve the sentences concurrently.\n\nKueng and Thao can still appeal their federal convictions. If they plead guilty in state court, any federal appeal would be moot, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who has been following the case. But it's also hard to win a federal appeal, he said.\n\n\"Those are some of the calculuses they are going to have to make in terms of, `Do I go to trial and risk something worse? Do I think I have a good shot at appeal on the federal case?'\" Brandt said.\n\nLane, who is white, pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing in that case. He was allowed to remain free on bond after his federal sentencing.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was sentenced to a 22 1/2-year state sentence in addition to his federal sentence. Those sentences are being served simultaneously.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He died Monday night in Minneapolis; video shared online by a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Jim Mone/AP hide caption\n\nA portrait of George Floyd is part of the memorial for him near the site of his arrest. He died Monday night in Minneapolis; video shared online by a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe.\n\nFriends of George Floyd watched in disbelief as the now-viral video played. It shows a handcuffed black man facedown on the street, pleading for his life. He's struggling to breathe as he's pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer's knee pressing into his neck.\n\nThe black man in the video was identified as Floyd, 46. He died Monday after he was taken to a hospital.\n\nFriends describe him as a \"gentle giant\" - he was 6 feet, 7 inches - who grew up in Houston's Third Ward, a center of the city's African American community. A vigil was held this week at Houston's Emancipation Park, in the neighborhood where Floyd grew up.\n\nHe was remembered by friend Johnny Phillips, who told Houston's Fox affiliate that Floyd \"was just a young guy that was athletic, fun to be around and was lovable.\"\n\nFormer NBA star Stephen Jackson met Floyd in high school, and they remained friends.\n\n\"He played two sports - football and basketball,\" Jackson said, speaking to the syndicated radio program The Breakfast Club .\n\nHouston Public Media reports that Floyd was \"talented enough to get a basketball scholarship from Florida State University.\" He didn't finish college there, instead returning to Houston to pursue another passion - making music. For a while in the 1990s, he performed under the name Big Floyd and collaborated with other artists in the local hip-hop scene.\n\nJackson said that where he and Floyd grew up, there could be a lot of fighting between neighborhoods. But he said Floyd was someone everyone liked.\n\n\"It makes me angry. It just hurts that people have that much hate,\" said Jackson, referring to the officers involved. Jackson says he worries about Floyd's two daughters now that they've lost their dad.\n\nJackson says Floyd moved to Minneapolis for work, driving trucks. He says Floyd was pulling his life back together after getting in trouble with the law and spending time in jail. By most accounts, Floyd was doing well in Minneapolis, where he found a new community.\n\nThe Star Tribune reports that for years Floyd had a security job at Conga Latin Bistro and was known for giving hugs to regulars. The restaurant's Facebook page paid tribute to Floyd, saying \"he was a peaceful and loving man\" who wouldn't have liked the \"violence, vandalism and riots.\"\n\nA second night of protests turned violent in the city, prompting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard on Thursday. But family and friends say they want the focus to be on Floyd, saying he was a good person.\n\n\"We need to see justice happen,\" his cousin Shareeduh Tate told CBS This Morning . She called Floyd's death a murder and wants police prosecuted. \"We want to see them arrested. We want to see them charged. We want to see them convicted for what they did.\"\n\nThe four police officers involved in the arrest have been fired.\n\nIn a joint statement , U.S Attorney Erica MacDonald and FBI Special Agent in Charge Rainer Drolshagen said they \"are conducting a robust criminal investigation\" headed by the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and the FBI's Minneapolis field office.\n\n\"If it is determined that there has been a violation of federal law, criminal charges will be sought,\" the statement said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "10 Questions About Empathy In America, A Year After George Floyd's Death\n\nBy\n\nBill Chappell\n\nPeople embrace last month in Minneapolis after the verdict is announced in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd. Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption\n\n\"I can't breathe.\" \"I'm scared.\" For many people, hearing someone say those words would prompt a scramble to help. But not all. It depends on who's listening.\n\nA year ago Tuesday, the world watched as George Floyd's life was taken from him in an agonizing 9 1/2-minute video - a murder a police officer was convicted of committing. This month, we saw long-suppressed footage of troopers stunning and punching Ronald Greene as he apologized for leading them on a high-speed chase. He too died.\n\nMillions of us watched those videos. But we didn't all see the same things, and part of the reason is empathy.  On a basic level, how we hear the words of Floyd - and more recently, the words of Greene - depends on our level of empathy.\n\nTestifying about the day Floyd died in Minneapolis, many witnesses wept, still feeling despair at not being able to help him.\n\n\"When I cried, the whole world cried,\" witness Charles McMillian said recently, describing the powerful testimony he gave in court.\n\nWitness Charles McMillian gets emotional as he begins his testimony in Chauvin's trial in Floyd's death.\n\nBut not everyone had the same response. To get a sense of why - and to learn whether America's relationship with empathy is changing - we spoke to two people who have spent decades studying empathy and bias: Elizabeth Segal , a professor at Arizona State University's School of Social Work, and Jody David Armour , a criminal justice and law professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nHow do you define empathy?\n\nElizabeth Segal: Empathy is a lot more complicated than we would like to think.\n\nI consider the word \"empathy\" a broad umbrella that includes \"interpersonal empathy\" and \"social empathy.\"\n\nGenerally, [interpersonal empathy is] the understanding of others from their perspective. In other words, it's both sharing feelings and understanding what those feelings mean to others ... one-on-one or in a very small group.\n\nSocial empathy fits more with what's going on in terms of coming to grips with racism in America and the death of George Floyd. It's trying to understand what experiences mean to other groups who are different from you and experiences you may never have. That's social empathy - and it's much harder.\n\nLet's get the big question out of the way: Do you see a lack of empathy as one reason racism continues to thrive in the U.S.?\n\nSegal: It's the lack of social empathy. You have a lot of people who don't have any experience or insight into people of other races, and that fills a void that often can be filled with stereotypes and displaced anger: \"I'm not getting ahead because of them.\" It's the other-ness of people. We have intrinsic tools for empathy, but we have to learn how to be empathic.\n\nJody David Armour: Absolutely, yes. But we have to carefully define terms, what we mean by racism, because a lot of my work recently and even early in my career was on unconscious bias. You know, something people now like to refer to as implicit bias.\n\nI initially was looking at how at the descriptive level, people unconsciously make harsher judgments about Blacks. But more recently, I came across studies involving brain imaging, that essentially show you your brain - and then here's your brain on race. It's a phenomenon called \"in-group empathy bias.\"\n\nThe study was based on the phenomenon that occurs when a person sees someone of the same race drinking water - the observer will simulate what he or she sees, in their mind. They don't pantomime it, but their brain's mirror neurons allow them to simulate what they see.\n\nProtesters stand outside the Government Center in Minneapolis in May 2020 to support CAIR-Minnesota in calling for the arrest of police in Floyd's death. Elizabeth Flores/Minneapolis Star Tribune via Getty Images hide caption\n\nProtesters stand outside the Government Center in Minneapolis in May 2020 to support CAIR-Minnesota in calling for the arrest of police in Floyd's death.\n\nThey found a tendency for that to fail when it comes to race. So that if you're someone, say, white and you're looking at somebody Black who is drinking a cup of water, your mirror neurons are less likely to fire. So, the basic building blocks of empathy and sympathy aren't there.\n\nOne thing we've seen is that more people of different backgrounds are now saying \"Black Lives Matter,\" the rallying call against violence targeting people of color. Do you also hear it as a call for empathy?\n\nArmour: No question, absolutely. At the heart of the Black Lives Matter mantra is an [implicit] ellipsis that people have chosen willfully to misinterpret. And that ellipsis is: Black Lives Matter, also .\n\nThe most natural reading is \"Black Lives Matter, too \": Why don't Black lives get the same kind of consideration, the same kind of care and concern as non-Black lives? That was the real thrust.\n\nYou can be willfully obtuse about what [BLM] means and say, \"Oh, you're saying only Black lives matter? No, all lives matter.\" There's a whole group of Blue Lives Matter people - the same people who were criticizing Black Lives Matter. What it meant was, they got it all along.\n\nConsidering the past year, do you believe more Americans are now finding empathy within, especially for people of other ethnicities?\n\nSegal: It seems to be the case. To be honest, I'm more optimistic with younger people. Empathy is actually a combination of different brain activities and changing brain behavior.\n\nFamily and friends react during a news conference last month following the verdict in Chauvin's trial in Minneapolis. The former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty on all three charges he faced in Floyd's May 2020 death. Nathan Howard/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFamily and friends react during a news conference last month following the verdict in Chauvin's trial in Minneapolis. The former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty on all three charges he faced in Floyd's May 2020 death.\n\nThat's what we struggle with - is to change images or ideas that are fixed in our brain from a young age. And that's why I have great faith in young people, because more and more of them seem to be actively trying. They're also living in a more diverse world, just through social media. I mean, they have more input than young people 50 years ago.\n\nThat exposure normalizes all these differences and helps to combat the stereotypes that then block empathy.\n\nWhen people learn about a confrontation between someone and the police, the defining narrative has often been a police statement that's very condensed, and only from the officer's point of view. But video provides this other window and sort of brings a chance for empathy. It's also where some people seem to diverge.\n\nSegal: That nine minutes and 29-second video [of Floyd and the police], the power of that video ... there'll be different reactions. But watching that is a form of experiencing something. And it was a horrific thing to watch, that a dry police report wouldn't give you.\n\nThat's the part that takes training, too, is what do you see in there? Who are you identifying with? If George Floyd looks like your father, your brother, your best friend, yourself - you're going to have a stronger reaction than if he looks different than you.\n\nThere's lots of research that empathy is triggered more deeply, more quickly, that empathic neuro actions in the brain are triggered deeper for people who look like us versus people who don't. That may be something deeply embedded in human beings from a survival perspective early, part of tribal living.\n\nWhat about people who are in a position of power? Do you see people's capacity for empathy being affected by how much power or authority they have?\n\nSegal: Yes, power actually blocks it. This is a generalization, but power can block empathy. And there's both good and bad reasons for that.\n\nStarting with the good reasons: When somebody is in a leadership position, if they are picking up and processing everyone's feelings and experiences - those who work for them or who are represented by them - they would be immobilized. So that's the part where power and leadership says, \"I can't attend to every need, I have to look more globally.\"\n\nThe bad part of it is that people in power don't tune in to people's needs and experiences. And the more powerful you become, the more closed off you are to people's lived, day-to-day experiences.\n\nThe other thing about power, which is very interesting from an empathy perspective: When you are less powerful, you have to read the people who are in power and the people who are around you, your peers. So you're bicultural, essentially.\n\nI mean, you talk to any racial minority, sexual minority, any minority, they speak multiple languages - I mean \"languages,\" as in culturally. We hear about it a lot, that African American parents have to have \"the talk\" with their sons about what happens if you get pulled over by police. That's a survival mechanism they have to learn. That's being multicultural.\n\nI understand why there's the call for bringing in social workers or people who behave differently with members of the community than the police, who are in charge of law and order. What I think's happening underneath is that they're saying, \"You have to see us as human beings.\"\n\nYou have to see people as a person with mental illness, or a person who's just been evicted and doesn't have any resources - as opposed to a law-and-order-only perspective: \"You've been evicted, you're breaking the law; you're screaming on the street, you're disturbing the peace.\"\n\nCan our laws do more to encourage or even require empathy? Should they do that?\n\nArmour: This is one of the things that the grassroots activists brilliantly drove home to us over the course of last summer. They say it's transformation, not reform, that we need transformative change.\n\nReform would be approaches that try to train police to be more empathetic, like implicit bias training. It tries to integrate them more into communities so they are, you know, in some ways on a more intimate basis with a lot of the people they're policing.\n\nBut the folks say those aren't the reforms that are going to get us free. Those aren't the reforms that are going to make the real difference, as long as you have a way of approaching safety that requires using the police to surveil communities and engage in stop and frisk - or stop and frisk on wheels.\n\nHave you seen America change in the past year?\n\nSegal: I tend to be an optimist in general, but I've seen great progress. I mean, it's sometimes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nWe have horrible unempathetic, horribly unsocially empathic behaviors in this country - slavery jumps out, of course. So we're not at all perfect. But we have undone some horrific laws in this country or ways of behaving, and we're moving in that path. So I'm cautiously optimistic. But it takes work. It's not something you can rest on at all. Every generation keeps pushing it forward.\n\nArmour: Heck yes, and it's been very interesting. In some ways I see reason for pessimism, but in other ways I see reason for great, great optimism and celebration, frankly.\n\nHow can we all get better at showing empathy?\n\nSegal: There's the golden rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" And I actually am not a believer of that - I think it's because I've had some really bad neighbors.\n\nBut the silver rule is: \"Do not do unto others that which you do not want done to you.\" Meaning, \"I don't have to love you. I don't have to like you, but I want to be treated well. So I'm going to treat you well.\"\n\nThe George Floyd video is so powerful. We need to ask, \"What if that were your father? What if that was you? What if that were you who was facedown on the ground with your hands cuffed?\"\n\nThat's where empathy can be powerful. I don't want to be killed lying on the street suffocating. Would you?\n\nConsidering the past year, do you believe more Americans are now finding empathy within, especially for people of other ethnicities?\n\nArmour: Yes, yes, yes. I would have been more pessimistic before this past summer. I saw an outpouring of empathy and sympathy for the excruciating death of George Floyd. And I think one of the things we saw is that building empathy can itself be a political process, humanizing people who are \"otherized.\"\n\nWe know that Black folk historically have been, and are still, otherized in America. And if you otherize an individual, it's harder to have empathy and sympathy for them.\n\nThat's part of what the otherization does: It robs them of claims to your sympathy and empathy. When you humanize them, when you recognize their humanity, you're able to establish a real firm basis for empathy and sympathy.\n\nAnd that's what has been going on with, you know, Black Lives Matter for a long time - the effort to humanize the victims of police brutality. A lot of times, the victims of police brutality were otherized as somehow criminals who deserved what they got.\n\nThey all deserve our empathy and sympathy, care and concern. You shouldn't forfeit your humanity even if you have done something wrong in some way, or your right to be treated with human dignity.\n\nInterviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Police Expert Says 'Excessive' Force Against Floyd Wasn't The Only Option\n\nBy\n\nBill Chappell\n\nA police expert says former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin used excessive force against George Floyd when Floyd died in police custody last May. The officers had other options, including simply talking to Floyd, according to Sgt. Jody Stiger, a use-of-force expert at the Los Angeles Police Department whose testimony continues on Wednesday.\n\n\"My opinion was that the force was excessive,\" Stiger told the jury on Tuesday, after reviewing the incident through police body cameras. He is appearing for the prosecution as a paid expert.\n\nStiger said he based his opinion on the \"objective reasonableness\" legal standard for the use of force and by weighing the officers' actions against the seriousness of the crime and the suspect's behavior.\n\nChauvin, who pinned his knee into Floyd's neck, is facing murder and manslaughter charges over the man's death. The case is being closely watched, after months of nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality.\n\nProsecution witness Jody Stiger, an LAPD sergeant, says officers were initially justified in using force against George Floyd - but Derek Chauvin's actions were excessive, he added. Stiger is appearing in the Minneapolis trial as a paid expert. Court TV via AP, Pool hide caption\n\nProsecution witness Jody Stiger, an LAPD sergeant, says officers were initially justified in using force against George Floyd - but Derek Chauvin's actions were excessive, he added. Stiger is appearing in the Minneapolis trial as a paid expert.\n\nAs Nelson began his cross-examination of Stiger on Wednesday, he established that Stiger has never testified as an expert in state or federal court. But Stiger also said that the Los Angeles County Superior Court has previously qualified him as an expert.\n\nNelson also said that of Stiger's 461-page report, roughly 26 pages reflect his opinions and the rest are a list of the more than 5,000 documents or records he was given to review before the trial.\n\nNelson referenced the Graham v. Connor ruling, noting that the Minneapolis police manual's reference to the ruling isn't limited to the three factors discussed earlier. Nelson notes that it quotes from the ruling:\n\n\"The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"\n\nThe citation continues, Nelson said, by acknowledging officers must make \"split-second judgments\" in tense situations. He says their decisions must be considered using the \"totality of circumstances.\"\n\nNoting that Stiger said on Tuesday that the amount of force used on Floyd was \"excessive,\" Nelson asked, \"That's not the standard, is it?\"  The standard, the defense attorney said, is whether the use of force is \"objectively reasonable.\"\n\nBut under follow-up questions from the prosecution, Stiger said the force used on Floyd \"was not objectively reasonable.\"\n\nNelson also noted that when Chauvin arrived at the scene, he was operating under the information available from the dispatch call: that two officers were struggling with a large man who was under the influence.\n\n\"You would agree ... that sometimes the use of force, it looks really bad, right?\" Nelson asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Stiger answered. But he agreed that sometimes such instances can still be lawful.\n\nNelson later displayed photos of the officers restraining Floyd, noting that one image suggests most of Chauvin's weight was on his right knee - on Floyd's back - rather than on his left knee, in Floyd's neck area.\n\nNelson also displayed two sequences of images - one from a bystander video and one from an officer's camera. From the sidewalk, Chauvin's knee appears to be on Floyd's neck, he said. But he added that from the closer view, Chauvin's knee appears to be on the base of Floyd's neck. Stiger agreed to those descriptions.\n\nIn the prosecution's follow-up questions, Schleicher asked about the risks of positional asphyxiation, and whether pressure on the neck or the body raises that risk.\n\n\"It's the pressure on the body\" that makes it harder to breathe, Stiger said. He also agreed that both of Chauvin's knees were on Floyd's body for the full 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nFloyd lost consciousness as police restrained him on the street outside of Cup Foods - the convenience store where he was accused of paying for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. When Chauvin arrived, Stiger said, he saw then-officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng struggling to get Floyd, who was in handcuffs, into the rear seat of a police SUV. Chauvin moved to help them.\n\n\"Mr. Floyd was actively resisting, moving around ... clearly he didn't want to be back there,\" Stiger said, adding that Floyd was pleading with officers and saying he couldn't breathe.\n\nChanging their plan, the officers pulled Floyd from the vehicle and he wound up on his knees in the street.\n\nUp to that point, Stiger said, the officers' actions could be perceived as reasonable. But he said the officers could have continued to talk to Floyd rather than use force, noting that Kueng seemed to have built a rapport with Floyd.\n\nAs Floyd was placed facedown on the asphalt, he kicked his leg at an officer - the only act of aggression Stiger saw in that phase of the struggle.\n\nChauvin and the other officers restrained Floyd for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, Stiger said. Referring to images from the scene, the use-of-force expert noted that at one point, Chauvin was placing most of his body weight on Floyd, with his right knee in the man's back and his left knee on Floyd's neck.\n\nIn addition to using his knees on Floyd, Chauvin is seen using his hand to put pressure on Floyd's hand or wrist, in an apparent \"pain compliance\" technique, Stiger said. \"The handcuffs were not double-locked,\" he added, meaning the restraints could continue to tighten on Floyd's wrists during the struggle.\n\nProsecutor Steve Schleicher asked what happens when a subject in that situation can't comply with officers' orders.\n\n\"Then at that point, it's just pain,\" Stiger replied. He then added that according to the recordings, Chauvin did not stop using the pain compliance technique.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department's manual cites the Supreme Court's landmark Graham v. Connor ruling of 1989, which established the reasonableness standard. The manual, seen in court Wednesday, lays out three components: the severity of the crime; whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to officers' or the public's safety; and whether the suspect is actively resisting or trying to flee.\n\nAsked if Floyd posed a threat when he was being restrained, Stiger said, \"No, he did not.\"\n\nStiger noted that Floyd was handcuffed in a prone position and was not trying to resist or assault the officers.\n\nAnother factor, Stiger said, was the number of officers at the scene: five, including four city officers and one Park Police officer.\n\nThree of the officers were using their body weight to control Floyd, he said.\n\nAfter referring to police use-of-force policies, Stiger said that in his opinion, \"No force should have been used once he was in that position.\"\n\nHe also said that the dangers of positional asphyxia have been known to police, as a person can die while handcuffed on their stomach or chest.\n\nSchleicher then turned to the bystanders who were watching and recording the officers from the sidewalk. Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has repeatedly brought up the idea that the crowd of around a dozen onlookers posed a potential threat to the officers.\n\nSchleicher asks Stiger if he has dealt with hostile crowds before while handcuffing a suspect. He says he has, with people throwing rocks and bottles at him and his colleagues in Los Angeles.\n\nReferring to footage from the scene outside of Cup Foods, Stiger said the videos did not show anyone throwing items or attacking the officers.\n\nThere was foul language and the officers were called names, he said. But Stiger adds that the crowd didn't affect his analysis because \"I did not perceive them as a threat.\" Most of them, he said, were showing \"their concern for Mr. Floyd.\"\n\nStiger also said officers can't ramp up the level of force they're using on someone solely because of a a third-party's actions.\n\nNoting that Chauvin underwent some 866 hours of police training, Schleicher asks if the officers should have been able to cope with the distraction posed by a crowd of bystanders.\n\nStiger said, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nOn the body camera recording, Chauvin is heard asking the two other officers whether they have a hobble device in their squad vehicle. Stiger described the device as a leg restraint that is often used to keep people from kicking out the windows once they're inside a car. The fact that the officers didn't use the device suggests they believed Floyd was starting to comply with their orders, he said.\n\nStiger is a 28-year veteran of the LAPD; he told the jury that he joined the police force after serving in the Marines. As part of his appearance for the prosecution, he reviewed videos from the scene as well as the Minneapolis Police Department's policy manual and training materials.\n\nStiger told the jury that he is currently on vacation from his job in California.

Rosa Park refused to give up her seat. His murder and her arrest lit the match that fired up the 20th century civil rights movement . But before Emmett, there were other Emmetts, Black bodies swinging from trees, beaten to a pulp, left to die alone in the woods. And before Rosa, other Rosas decided they too, were fed up. They werenât giving up their seats, not today, no, not ever.\n\nEric Garner couldnât breathe in Staten Island. Freddie Gray broke his neck on an alleged ârough rideâ in Baltimore. Michael Brown lay in the streets of Ferguson, baking under the Missouri sun. For four hours.\n\nA city worker repaints Black Lives Matter Plaza on May 13 in Washington, D.C. The words \"Black Lives Matter\" was painted on a two block section of 16th Street last year following the George Floyd protests. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nGeorge Floyd was murdered one year ago today. His death, as his young daughter put it, âchanged the world.â And so, at first, we measured that change in time. The amount of time, that is, it took for him to die, the dividing line between then and now. First we counted that time, clocking in at 8 minutes, 46 seconds. Then prosecutors counted again: It was, actually, they said, 7 minutes, 46 seconds. By the time Derek Chauvin faced his jury, weâd all settled on a number.\n\nHowever we measure it, George Floyd took what felt like an eternity to die. And as we watched his final moments, many of us were changed, too.\n\nRead the series\n\n01\n\nA Minneapolis neighborhood, revisited\n\n02\n\nCorporate America in the spotlight\n\n03\n\nThe Black women leading big cities\n\n04\n\nPolice violence, unchanged\n\n05\n\nThe tide of white âwoketivismâ\n\n06\n\nA civil rights-focused Justice Department\n\nSomething about that video, about those 9 minutes, 29 seconds, left us â many of us â unsettled in ways the countless other videos of Black people dying at the hands of police â¦ didnât.\n\nAnd just like Emmett Tillâs murder served as a catalyst more than 60 years ago â birthing Brown v. Board of Education , the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act â Floydâs killing shook something loose.\n\nNot in the faux, âcancel cultureâ way decried by critics. But woke as in awakened. Compelled to act. Across the globe, people of all stripes took to the streets. They protested in South Africa and in South America, in Seoul and in Syriaâ¦. Chanting âBlack Lives Matter,â âColored Lives Matter,â âPapuan Lives Matter,â âNative American Lives Matterââ¦. This month the tragedy in Israel and Palestine birthed a new hashtag: #PalestinianLivesMatter. Teachers, activists, companies, politicians, scrambled to do something, anything. Aunt Jemima got a makeover. Juneteenth became a paid holiday. Confederate statues were toppled. The âBâ in Black got capitalized. Editors looked around their newsrooms and realized they needed to change, too. (Including this one.)\n\nLeft: Black Lives Matter activists march through downtown Columbus, Ohio. Right: A Black Lives Matter activist holds a sign against police brutality in front of the Ohio Statehouse in reaction to the shooting of MaâKhia Bryant on April 20. | Stephen Zenner/Getty Images\n\nThe neighborhood where Floyd was killed changed, a series of barricades, checkpoints  and art installations where activists refuse to budge until their demands for a complete overhaul of the cityâs police department are met.\n\nCorporations attempted to get woke . Yes, there were those much-mocked black squares on Instagram. But corporations tried to show up â or appear to show up â in other ways. Corporate CEOs, including, Appleâs Tim Cook, Ciscoâs Chuck Robbins, Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg and JPMorganâs Jamie Dimon praised the guilty verdicts in the trial of Derek Chauvin. Both Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola, two of Georgiaâs largest employers, under pressure from activists, took firm stands against GOP-led efforts in the state to limit voting access.\n\nSome white people got woke. Racial justice protests picked up more white participants than ever before , according to researchers. Nearly 65 percent of protesters filling the streets in New York, Washington and Los Angeles last year were white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Department of Justice began investigating â in ways they hadnât before â police departments and individuals charged with violating the civil rights of Black and brown Americans killed by cops.\n\nMeanwhile, Black women were deemed the saviors of a political party. And some Black women leaders, mayors of major cities, were tested in ways they hadnât been before , particularly as cities went up in flames. Sometimes they met the challenge. Sometimes they didnât.\n\nAnd some things didnât change. Some things remained â dispiritedly â the same. The pace of fatal encounters with police remains virtually unchanged from last year. Rashard Brooks, Andrew Brown Jr., MaâKhia Bryant, Adam Toledo and Daunte Wright all met the same fate as George Floyd. Last week, we learned of the killing of Ronald Greene Jr. at the hands of police in Monroe, La., in 2019, almost exactly a year before Floyd died.\n\nPolice originally said Greene died after crashing his car into a tree following a high-speed chase. But released body cam footage shows police choking, punching and firing a stun gun at the 49-year-old barber, while they cursed at him and called him names. In the 46-minute video, Greene begs for his life: âIâm scared! Iâm scared!â\n\nThat video, coming in the wake of the anniversary of Floydâs death, is an all-too-vivid illustration of the numbers:  Black people are still three times more likely to be killed by the police than are white people. Native Americans are also much more likely to die at the hands of law enforcement than are white Americans .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, amid our annus horribilis, something has shifted, something tangible â and intangible. Maybe itâs just a shift in perception, a deeper understanding of all the ways in which an accident of birth, mere degrees of melanin and hair texture, can shape oneâs lot in life.\n\nWeâre trying to understand that, too. Consider these six stories our attempt to do just that, digging deep, taking the measure of a movement, of a moment, of change.\n\nEditing: Teresa Wiltz , Charlie Mahtesian\n\nProject Management and Strategy: Rishika Dugyala\n\nLanding page and design: Beatrice Jin\n\nReporters: Renu Rayasam , Maya King , Ben White , Monica Akhtar , Daniel Payne , Brakkton Booker , Josh Gerstein and Nolan McCaskill\n\nÂ© 2020 POLITICO LLC"

      "text": "Few Cops We Found Using Force on George Floyd Protesters Are Known to Have Faced Discipline\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast summer, ProPublica compiled 68 videos that appeared to show police officers using disproportionate force against protesters during the nationwide events following George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\nWe had culled the videos from hundreds circulating on social media in the wake of the protests and highlighted the cases that seemed to clearly show officers using disproportionate force. We then reached out to dozens of law enforcement agencies whose officers are in the videos and asked some straightforward questions: Have the officers' police departments investigated the incidents? And what consequences, if any, have the officers in the videos faced?\n\nAs time passed, we've been checking in with the departments to get their answers.\n\nAfter a year, we wanted to give a final update on what we know: Departments have disclosed discipline for 10 officers.\n\nA Seattle Police Department officer received a written reprimand for striking a protester with \"six to eight punches over six seconds.\" In Grand Rapids, Michigan, an officer shot a man in the shoulder at close range with a long-range tear gas round. He received two days without pay. In Salt Lake City, an officer received \" coaching and counseling \" for using a shield to push an elderly man.\n\nSix officers were initially fired, though two got their jobs back after a review. Criminal charges are also pending against 11 officers, including some who have already faced internal discipline.\n\nIn 17 cases that we followed, the departments have decided not to discipline the officers or could not identify them.\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing in 25 of the cases. This includes a high-profile case in Buffalo, New York, where two officers pushed a man backward , causing him to hit his head on the pavement. A grand jury dismissed felony assault charges against the officers, but a decision on departmental discipline is still pending.\n\nFinally, in 18 instances, ProPublica could not determine the disciplinary outcome - either because the department did not respond or the department said it could not share the information.\n\nThe weaving journey of accountability has played out starkly around one of the cases in Atlanta.\n\nIn May 2020, the mayor announced the firing of two officers just a day after they were involved in the violent arrest of two college students who were pulled from a car.\n\nBut the officers quickly sued to get their jobs back, citing a lack of due process. In February, Atlanta's Civil Service Board agreed. The two officers are once again employed by the department but remain on administrative leave. The incident remains under investigation. Criminal charges have also been filed against the officers , including assault, though the district attorney who brought them has since been voted out of office.\n\nRead More\n\nOne reason departments have declined to comment on the status of cases is that the incidents have been subject to litigation. But the back and forth on such suits can be illuminating.\n\nResponding to a lawsuit by a protester who was hit by a Los Angeles Police Department vehicle, the city wrote that the \"force used against plaintiff, if any, was caused and necessitated by the actions of plaintiff, and was reasonable and necessary for self-defense.\"\n\nIn about half of the cases we reviewed, including one resulting in discipline, the officer or officers involved have not been publicly identified. Sometimes, it's not even clear which law enforcement agency they worked for.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where Floyd's death occurred, sparking outrage across the world, a video captured the moment in May when officers patrolling a neighborhood fired paint rounds at a woman's home while enforcing a curfew.\n\nA Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told ProPublica the agency was \"not involved\" in the incident. The Minneapolis Police Department said the incident was \"not our agency.\" The Minnesota State Patrol said that it reviewed the video of the incident, and that \"the officer who fired the marking round was not a State Patrol trooper.\" When asked which agency the officers who fired the paint round were from, the spokesperson said it was \"unclear.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nI identify documents, sources and specialized datasets to advance investigations.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "More Than Two Years After George Floyd's Murder Sparked a Movement, Police Reform Has Stalled. What Happened?\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, George Floyd's caught-on-camera murder by a Minneapolis police officer prompted massive social justice protests across the country. Millions of people marched for law enforcement reform - even Sen. Mitt Romney , the Utah Republican and onetime GOP presidential nominee. Activists pressed policymakers to \"defund the police.\"\n\nAmid the pressure, elected officials pledged sweeping changes to how officers operate and how they're overseen.\n\nBut two and a half years later, with violent crime increasing across the country , that momentum has seemingly stalled. In Washington, support for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would have created a national police misconduct registry among other measures, withered while lawmakers passed bipartisan legislation to invest in the police. A recent House bill would award local police departments $60 million annually for five years, with few of the kinds of accountability measures for cops that progressives had advocated.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, home to the nation's largest police force, Mayor Eric Adams pledged to recruit officers with the right temperament for the job, weeding out overly aggressive cops while taking on violent criminals. He has since staked his mayoralty on combating crime , empowering the police to pursue a range of functions, from sweeping homeless encampments to relaunching a controversial plainclothes anti-crime unit , which had only recently been disbanded over criticisms that it disproportionately targeted Black and Latino New Yorkers and was involved in many police killings.\n\nTo make sense of these shifts, I called Elizabeth Glazer, one of New York's leading experts on criminal justice . For more than two decades, she's been working in law enforcement and policymaking circles, first as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where she leveraged federal racketeering laws to put shooters and their enablers behind bars, then as a government official, including the deputy secretary for public safety under New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Most recently, she served as the director of the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice during the Bill de Blasio administration.\n\nThis year, Glazer founded Vital City , a nonprofit dedicated to offering practical solutions to public safety problems. The endeavor is something of a call for a rebirth of civic mindedness, drawing on research that shows how communities can both be safer and feel safer if the whole of city government - not just the police - acts, including cleaning up vacant lots , turning on street lights and employing young people during the summer.\n\nWe discussed police reform post-Floyd, the role of the cops and the shifting narrative around public safety amid rising levels of crime. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwo things happened: One, there's a kind of built-in conservatism about the importance of maintaining the police. As a country, we are afraid to change policing because we are so firmly attached to the view that it is only the police that can keep us safe.\n\nThe second thing is, the movement coincided with rocketing rates of increase in shootings. Suddenly, scary violence really erupted in ways we hadn't seen in many years. And our reflex when crime happens is, \"Call the police,\" not, \"Make sure you have enough summer youth employment.\" That bolstered the reluctance to make changes.\n\nBut I think the other thing is that \"defund the police\" was really a lost opportunity. It sort of had this toxic messaging. So it was viewed as an existential threat to police departments. But in fact, it might've been an enormous opportunity if police departments didn't view it that way. It could have been a chance for them to begin to reshape their roles in a way that focused on their core strengths and to begin to give back to other professionals the responsibility to deal with the homeless, those with mental illness and all these other areas where their authority had kind of expanded into.\n\nIn fact, cops have often said: \"We don't want to be social workers. That's not our job.\" So it does seem like there's an opportunity. But we don't start from that point because I think there's a sense from the profession that they are under attack and underappreciated. And if you say, 'Do less,' it feels like yet a further attack, as opposed to, 'How can we support you to do what you do best?' What's happened is that the police department, as it accretes more and more functions, occupies a very prominent role among the city agencies. But actually we're a civilian government, we have civilian heads whose job, really, is to ensure the police are part of an integrated civic approach, ensuring that communities thrive.\n\nThe police are great at solving crimes. And that is something that only they can do, and, really, that is what they should do.\n\nBut the line between who is police and who is government more broadly has become more and more blurred, so what you see is police really taking over all kinds of civic services. In New York City, the Police Department is funded to the tune of millions of dollars to construct community centers and do community programming. They have an employment program. They do graffiti removal. They do mentoring. They have a beekeeper. All of these are civic services. Why are the police doing it?\n\nWe seem to have gotten into this strange Rube Goldberg situation, in which the police, as a stated matter, are saying, \"We're doing it in order to build trust with the community.\" But it's really a backward way of doing it and ultimately, I think, ineffective because it is hard to make friends when it is an unequal relationship. It is hard to say: \"Play basketball with me. By the way, I have a gun.\" Or, \"By the way, on another day I may be arresting you and your friends.\" It's just the way things are constructed. But the police can build respect by solving cases. And I think neighborhoods rely upon them, and have respect for them, when they do that job they can do so excellently.\n\nI think the frustration I was expressing then was that there didn't seem to be a connection between going back in and arresting people over and over again and saying, \"OK, well now a bunch of people who have been killing other people in the neighborhood have been arrested. Before another group steps in to fill the void, is there something else that can be done?\" Who has that panoramic view?\n\nA civilian needs to be the one who has that panoramic view, that civilian being the mayor, who oversees all the different services that are produced for the benefit of a city's citizens and weaves them together toward one goal, which is supporting the well-being of New Yorkers. The police are an important part of that, but they are not the most important part, and they are not the point of the spear. They are a civic service that needs to be coordinated and synchronized with all these other efforts, focused on neighborhoods in need and working alongside their colleagues in housing, parks, employment and all the other things that keep us safe.\n\nAt the same time, when you think about this service of last resort, meaning the criminal justice system, it's much more than just the city. Somebody also needs to coordinate that, and it needs to be someone who has enough gravitas and connections to have players who do not report to them be willing to think together and act together for a common goal.\n\nI mean, certainly the mayor's campaign rhetoric was very much about dealing with upstream issues. He famously quoted Bishop [Desmond] Tutu about making sure people don't \" fall into the river .\" And he's been a big proponent on summer youth employment. The difficulty is, it's unclear what the plan is and how it all fits together. And then, even to the extent that one thing or another is announced, how are those things doing? And do they connect to anything else that's being done?\n\nCrime is now and always has been highly, highly concentrated, particularly violent crime. If you look at the neighborhoods that suffered the most number of shootings today and 30 years ago, they're almost identical. Many fewer shootings now, but still, they lead the city. And right across the board, every social distress is borne in these neighborhoods, including poor health outcomes and high unemployment. So we're seeing the durability of place.\n\nRead More\n\nThere are community groups who have the slogan, \"Nothing stops a bullet like a job.\" And in fact they're exactly right. Our problem is it doesn't feel like immediate action. One of the great attractions, I think, for elected officials and for residents of sending in the police is it feels like something is being done. We've seen over and over again; that can't be the only answer. And we have such incredibly good evidence about what else stops crime right now, not in 20 years, but right now. Turning on the lights reduces crime. Summer youth employment reduces crime.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm an investigative reporter covering the intersection of business and government.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced multiple crises.\n\nThe trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd was coming to a close. As the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death approached, authorities were preparing for the kind of unrest that had damaged or destroyed long stretches of the city in 2020. Meanwhile, a package of police reform bills was stalled in the divided Minnesota state Legislature.\n\nThen, on April 11, 2021, a police officer shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in the northern Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, touching off a fresh round of protests, clashes with the police, and criticism of Walz after he sent in hundreds of officers and armored vehicles that had been readied in anticipation of the trial's aftermath.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Walz still saw an opening to bring police reform to Minnesota and provide a national model for systemic change. He feared the 2021 session would be his last, best chance to do so. But he told the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who made repeated trips to Minneapolis during the upheaval after Floyd's death, that local politics were getting in the way.\n\n\"I wish I could report more on our progress,\" Walz told Jackson in a call transcribed by a staff member. \"Both you and President Obama mentioned that Minnesota should be the state that could get this right. That's a responsibility that we have in Minnesota.\"\n\nThe clamorous close of the 2021 legislative session, and Walz's role in trying to enact police reform in response to the police killings of Floyd and Wright, plays out in a cache of thousands of internal emails from the Walz administration obtained by ProPublica and the Minnesota Reformer. The emails were requested that summer by independent journalist Tony Webster, but the administration only recently finished turning them over. Webster shared them with the news organizations.\n\nThough the emails are limited, covering about 11 weeks from April to June 2021, they provide a closer, more detailed look at how Walz tried to leverage his influence on the legislative process. They reveal a politician who seems to be a careful listener in one-on-one conversations with grieving mothers and Black activists, freely giving out his personal cellphone number and invitations to the governor's mansion.\n\nAnd they show how Walz struggled to balance the need for order in the streets against his credibility with activist allies, while simultaneously trying to bridge the ideological divide between progressives in his party and pro-law-enforcement conservatives.\n\n\"He likes being liked,\" former state Rep. Patrick Garofalo, a Republican, said of how Walz operates. \"He's thinking about political survival, and it's nothing more complicated than that. The guy's not an ideologue.\"\n\nSince Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz to be her running mate, the governor has rocketed to national prominence, praised by Democrats for his progressive \"Midwestern dad\" image while labeled a \"dangerously liberal extremist\" who wants to defund the police by Harris' opponent, former President Donald Trump. Walz has never advocated defunding the police.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also tried to cast Walz's response to the 2020 unrest as weak and ineffectual, despite the fact that, at the time, Trump praised Walz for deploying the National Guard, calling it a \" beautiful thing to watch .\"\n\nIn the end, Walz emerged from the 2021 special legislative session with a compromise bill on police reform that seemingly satisfied no one. For some Democrats, it didn't go far enough. Many called the bill a disappointment. Some Republicans felt it went too far. The next year, facing reelection, Walz received no major law enforcement endorsements.\n\n\"He is not a radical,\" said Michelle Phelps, a University of Minnesota sociology professor and author of \"The Minneapolis Reckoning.\" \"He is, I think, a sort of a vanguard of what a more progressive, but still centrist, liberal Democratic wing of the party could look like.\"\n\nIn response to questions, Teddy Tschann, a spokesperson for Walz, said in a statement that the governor \"is committed to bringing people with different views and backgrounds together to find common ground and get things done.\"\n\nAfter Wright was killed, as demonstrations escalated outside the Brooklyn Center police station, texts streamed into Walz's phone.\n\n\"Can you please get those cops out of there and send in the national guard?\" one Democratic lawmaker texted him.\n\nThat night residents, protesters and journalists in Brooklyn Center met with members of Operation Safety Net, an aggressive coalition of Minnesota National Guard soldiers, state troopers and local police who used tear gas and flash-bangs to clear the streets. A prominent union leader texted Walz less than 24 hours later: \"Escalating with tanks and national guard is not helping. You can calm the situation, but this isn't the way.\"\n\nAn attorney representing 30 national and local media organizations would later write to Walz with a detailed list of documented abuses the group said journalists were subjected to at the hands of law enforcement, warning that the state agencies under Walz's control seemed to have no regard for the First Amendment.\n\nDespite renewed tension and unrest, emails from Walz staffers document his outreach to members of Black activist groups and the families of people killed by police in Minnesota. On April 20, the day a jury found Chauvin guilty of murdering Floyd, Walz staff logged phone conversations with the Floyd family, the Rev. Al Sharpton and former President Barack Obama. In one phone conversation on the anniversary of Floyd's death - a day on which Walz called for 9 minutes and 29 seconds of silence acknowledging the length of time Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck - Walz reflected on his own \"inherent racial bias.\"\n\n\"I wanted to be thoughtful and be intentional around race and the murder of George Floyd. I am trying to learn this year,\" he said, according to a staffer's transcript of a call with the leader of a local foundation. \"If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a lot of villages to raise a governor.\"\n\nWith Walz, some advocates felt acknowledged in a way that was initially refreshing.\n\n\"The governor looked me in my eyes and said, 'John, I need you to get me some legislation,'\" said Johnathon McClellan, president of the Minnesota Justice Coalition, a racial equity nonprofit that advocates for social justice reform. \"He understood the protests. He understood what the people were asking for.\"\n\nWalz received a flood of advice and opinions on what the next legislative steps should be, some from less-expected entities. The Minnesota Business Partnership, a group representing the CEOs of companies like 3M and Cargill as well as other business leaders, urged Walz to advocate for training policy changes and measures to make it harder to hire police officers who'd engaged in misconduct, while stressing that the group was broadly pro-law enforcement.\n\n\"Minnesota's reputation matters,\" said Charlie Weaver, the partnership's executive director at the time. \"If we had a reputation as a hostile environment for minority workers, that's a big problem for our large companies.\"\n\nThe Walz administration leapt at the chance to arrange a meeting between lawmakers and Weaver, a former chief of staff for Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. \"We need their help pushing key issues in the Senate,\" wrote one policy adviser.\n\nBut the leadership of the Republican-controlled Senate criticized broader reform efforts as \"anti-police.\" Behind the scenes, according to an internal memo, the Senate agreed to just three of the dozens of proposals the Democrat-controlled House had advanced and Walz had supported.\n\n\"I wasn't going to take things that I knew would hinder a good police officer from doing their job, and also hinder us from getting quality police in the future,\" said then-Senate majority leader Paul Gazelka in an interview.\n\nIn response, Walz brokered a meeting between Gazelka and Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. The group's founder, Toshira Garraway, lost her fiance in 2009 after he was chased by the St. Paul police and later found dead in a bin at a recycling facility. She wanted to advocate for a bill eliminating the statute of limitations on wrongful death suits against police. (Garraway did not respond to requests for comment.) Gazelka said that the request for the meeting, coming straight from Walz, was unusual.\n\n\"I certainly was willing to do that, and did listen to them,\" Gazelka said.\n\nThat meeting took place on June 3, 2021, the same day that a U.S. Marshals Service task force shot and killed Winston Smith Jr. in a parking garage in Minneapolis while trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. Walz's office once again put the National Guard on notice and made repeated requests to the Biden administration to address its role in the incident and ease pressure on local authorities.\n\n\"DOJ in DC is a hard 'no' on doing a press conference,\" staffers wrote in the days after Smith's death. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nWalz couldn't avoid blowback, even from prominent local activists with whom he shared a cordial relationship. A letter sent by Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and the founder of the Racial Justice Network who was in contact with the administration throughout the spring, demanded that Walz create an independent entity to investigate Smith's death, criticizing the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension as hopelessly biased. Staff from both Walz's office and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety wrote a draft of a response that said the BCA, which investigates incidents where police kill people, had the administration's \"utmost trust and confidence.\" Although Levy Armstrong could not confirm that she got the reply, the BCA retained control of the case.\n\nProtests over Smith's death continued until a drunk driver plowed into a group of demonstrators, killing one woman and injuring others. The next day, on June 14, the Minnesota Legislature entered a special session with no movement on police reform and the threat of a government shutdown looming over negotiations. Roughly 38,000 potential layoff notices had already been sent to state employees, and Walz and Senate and House lawmakers had two and a half weeks to come to an agreement. Republicans were particularly eager to pass a bill that would end Walz's COVID-19-era emergency powers.\n\n\"It was very nerve-wracking,\" said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat. \"There were two pressures coming for a shutdown: the Republicans were interested in shutting down the government if the governor didn't give up his emergency powers. My caucus was interested in shutting down the government if we didn't have some public safety reforms.\"\n\nAfter the first day of the special session, Walz staffers noted that Senate Republicans had \"retracted policy concessions\" and seemed \"withdrawn from negotiations.\" Around the same time, Walz policy advisers were also doing damage control after sending an email that erroneously announced that the Minnesota Justice Coalition and Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence had pared down their list of desired legislation from nine bills to four, prompting an angry press release from the groups: \"WE WANT TO MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT WE MADE NO SUCH AGREEMENT.\" Kristin Beckmann, then Walz's deputy chief of staff, admonished the policy advisers for speaking out of turn.\n\n\"This is a major set back in that trust. It's really frustrating,\" she wrote. Beckmann did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe emails end in mid-June with Walz's schedulers batting away invitations and meetings to allow for all-day negotiation sessions while staffers tried to craft messaging for increasingly anxious state employees. \"We're getting a lot of internal pushback that we haven't been able to provide enough information,\" one state communications worker wrote.\n\nReform advocates had been urging Walz for weeks to take a hard-line stance during the final budget negotiations, even allowing the government to shut down to force more sweeping changes. But the governor made it clear that was a line he would not cross, according to staff notes on the conversations.\n\nWalz said that he \"had concerns over shutting down the government and that this hurts many of the people the administration is trying to help. He said he was hopeful on a few items passing this year,\" according to the summation of a phone call with McClellan, the president of the Minnesota Justice Coalition. \"He made it clear it was unlikely that everything he's pushing for will pass.\"\n\nThe notes proved prophetic. Three days before the deadline, Walz, Gazelka and Hortman announced a deal. The final bill included new restrictions on no-knock warrants, a law requiring 911 operators to alert mental health crisis teams under certain circumstances, and the creation of a kind of warrant that doesn't require police to take suspects into custody. The package also included salary increases for state law enforcement, money for body cameras and enhanced penalties for the attempted murder of officers.\n\nThrough an executive action, Walz also directed state law enforcement agencies to turn over body camera footage from deadly police encounters to the affected families within five days.\n\nGarraway's bill to eliminate the statute of limitations on wrongful death suits against the police hit the cutting room floor, as did bills that would disallow police from making a number of equipment-related traffic stops, like ones for expired registration tags, and a bill that would form a civilian oversight board. In an interview with The Washington Post, Walz said he felt he'd \"failed\" Garraway .\n\nRead More\n\nAt the end of one of Walz's last press conferences that session, Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and one of the people the Walz administration had kept in close contact with that spring, pushed through reporters to ask Walz to veto the compromise bill, saying it actually provided more cover for police. Walz, looking tired, listened, addressed Hussein by his first name and said he would not veto the bill.\n\n\"This is the challenge of democracy,\" Walz said. \"There are going to be a lot of people in this moment [who] see this as not acceptable. I understand that.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

Reporter Alec MacGillis asks: Will the result be different this time?\n\nby Alec MacGillis\n\nExamining the News\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was co-published with The Atlantic and is not subject to our Creative Commons license.\n\nAcross the United States, cities are experiencing turbulence and a rise in gun violence following the protests of abusive policing sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. More than 110 people were shot in that city in the month following Floyd's death, eight fatally. In Atlanta, 106 people were shot over a 28-day period ending July 11, up from 40 over the same period last year.\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent years that America has seen such protests followed by a spike in violence. In the spring of 2015 , the death of Freddie Gray, 25, from injuries sustained in police custody brought demonstrators into the streets of Baltimore. The protests flared into rioting and looting. Soon afterward, the city's chief prosecutor announced criminal charges against the officers involved in the arrest. The officers' colleagues responded by pulling back on the job, doing only the bare minimum in the following weeks. In the resulting void, crews seized new drug corners and settled old scores. Homicides surged to record levels and case-closure rates plunged . \"The police stopped doing their jobs, and let people fuck up other people,\" Carl Stokes, a former Democratic city councilor in Baltimore, told me last year. \"Period. End of story.\"\n\nThe protests of recent months, which reignited again in August following the shooting of a man by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as he leaned into his vehicle, have created real momentum for efforts to reform police departments. In many cities, though, rank-and-file police officers are greeting these efforts with an apparent pullback. They say they are aggrieved by the charges against their fellow officers, public criticism of their department as a whole or growing calls to greatly reduce their powers and resources. In several cities, rising violence is already undermining support for shifting resources out of police departments, including among many Black residents and elected leaders . If reformers hope to succeed in curbing overpolicing, they will first have to overcome the challenge of underpolicing, which has often allowed officers to exercise an effective veto on reform.\n\nMichael McGinn dealt with a police pullback when he was mayor of Seattle in 2012. And, he told me, the problem has a straightforward solution: A mayor facing a police pullback has to make it plain that officers are accountable to the elected government they serve. That starts, he said, with relatively small steps, such as demanding that officers uncover their badge numbers. And if officers refuse? \"Anyone who doesn't follow an order gets sent home. That's what you do with someone who doesn't follow orders in a semi-military organization. You fire them.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, where the City Council approved legislation that would put up for referendum the wholesale replacement of the Police Department, residents have reported a notable decrease in police presence. \"All you see now is them with their windows up,\" one told The Washington Post . In Atlanta, many officers started calling in sick in reaction to the 11 charges, including felony murder, filed against Garrett Rolfe on June 17. The former Atlanta police officer shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, who had been found asleep in his car in a drive-thru, following a tussle with Rolfe and his partner after he failed a sobriety test. Brooks ran from Rolfe and his partner and fired a Taser that he had wrestled from the partner.\n\nThe interim police chief, Rodney Bryant, was left to plead with the officers on his force to do their job. \"I implore you to channel your concerns for your fellow officers by having their back. At this moment, I implore you to remember why you became a police officer. We did not choose this line of work because it was easy,\" he said . \"We became officers because we wanted to help people in distress, make a difference in our communities and simply serve and protect.\n\nBryant's appeal echoed the plea made to Baltimore officers in the spring of 2015 by Anthony Batts, then the city's police commissioner, as homicides soared following Gray's death. \"I talked to them again about character and what character means,\" Batts told me and other reporters. \"I'm sharing with them what it is to put that holster on every day, to put that badge on every day, to put that uniform on every day: the character that it takes, the responsibility that comes with that, and our responsibility to this community and to the 9-year-old little boys who are playing in the middle of the street that get shot. (Batts was replaced as commissioner a few weeks later.)\n\nIt is too early to say whether the Atlanta and Minneapolis officers' pullback will result in a continuing surge of violent crime. In the case of Baltimore, as a ProPublica investigation explored in detail last year , a police pullback appeared to be an instigating element that combined with other problems to create a breakdown of civil order in the city. The rise of violence there has yet to abate , five years later, and has resulted in more than 500 deaths over and above the average homicide toll of the decade prior to 2015.\n\nRises and falls in crime rates are notoriously hard to explain definitively. Scholars still don't agree on the causes of a decadeslong nationwide decline in crime . Still, some academics who have studied the phenomenon in recent years see evidence that rising rates of violence in cities that have experienced high-profile incidents of police brutality are driven by police pullbacks. Many criminologists also cite the general deterioration of trust between the community and police, which leaves residents less likely to report crimes, call in tips or testify in court. Added to that are the dynamics that are now likely also driving a rise in violent crime, even in cities that have not witnessed recent high-profile deaths at police hands: the economic and social stresses of the pandemic lockdowns, including disruptions to illegal drug markets, and the usual seasonal rise in violence during summer.\n\nLawrence Grandpre, the research director with Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, a Baltimore activist organization, cautions against overstating the role of underpolicing in the rise in violence. He argues that some of the cities where police are coming under scrutiny are also ones where Black residents have been struggling the most with long-standing inequities that could fuel disorder in this time of protest and pandemic-induced stress. \"The dynamics that drive violent crime are intra-community dynamics,\" he told me. \"It's the accumulation of historical trauma in communities. Look to the social and economic disruption of COVID and the sense of hopelessness and desperation that falls on these communities that feel that nothing is working. ... When you're under stress and feel hopeless, it's more likely that these conflicts spiral into violence.\"\n\nAlongside such local dynamics, though, the shared recent experience of cities such as Baltimore, Atlanta, and Minneapolis points to one of the biggest challenges facing municipal leaders who are trying to hold police officers accountable for possible abuses of power and reform their police departments as a whole: the prospect that officers will pull back, staging a silent strike that, at best, leaves the city unable to contend with a spike in violence or, at worst, helps give rise to one.\n\nThe problem is not new, but the politics surrounding it have suddenly changed. For decades, it was political death to run afoul of the police and their powerful unions. Now the electorates of many cities have shifted further left and grown more vociferous about demanding police reform and even defunding departments, which puts more pressure on elected leaders to take a tougher stand against their departments than they might have in years past.\n\nThat means big-city mayors including Atlanta's Keisha Lance Bottoms, New York's Bill de Blasio and Chicago's Lori Lightfoot face a daunting challenge. They have to navigate two problems at the same time: reining in overpolicing while also preventing underpolicing, the consequences of which are every bit as dire. And a great many lives are riding on how well they pull that off.\n\n\"The real issue,\" McGinn told me, \"is what actions will mayors take to reassert control over the police department? Can a mayor admit they don't have control and take more firm action to gain control? That's a big bridge for a mayor to cross. But if you don't cross that bridge, then you have the situation we have across America.\n\nIn Atlanta, the police union has responded to the pressure for accountability and reform by blaming its critics. \"Officers are fed up. They've been treated like crap both by their fellow citizens and their own legislators,\" said Vince Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, which represents most Atlanta officers. \"You can't have it both ways - call us and we come to do our job, but then if our job gets ugly, we're the bad guys.\"\n\nSome of the activists seeking to defund or limit policing might welcome this line of argument - see how you like life without us . But many other activists battling against abuses say they recognize the need for policing, done properly, and they worry about what will happen if police respond to calls for reform by pulling back. \"A lot of the onus for the violence falls right at the feet of law enforcement,\" Gerald Griggs, the first vice president of the NAACP's Atlanta branch, told the Post . \"There are certain elements in our community that don't take a break when the police take a break. You're sworn to protect and defend, but when there are a few rogue [police] being held accountable you decide to shirk your responsibility?\"\n\nAs mayor of Seattle, McGinn inherited policing trouble: He was tasked with negotiating a consent decree in 2012 with the U.S. Department of Justice to overhaul the city's Police Department following several incidents of police force against minority residents, including the fatal shooting of a Native woodcarver and an officer punching a 17-year-old Black girl in the face. The federal government has imposed more than 40 such decrees or other forms of settlement , and conducted about 30 investigations that did not result in decrees, since Congress gave it the authority to do so in 1994, after the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles. And many of the decrees have been met with what experts call \"de-policing\" by officers upset about the scrutiny or worried about running afoul of new limits.\n\nMcGinn, a garrulous Democrat who was the Washington State chairman of the Sierra Club before running for office, said in an interview that he was getting reports at the time that officers were taking less initiative to act on possible offenses they witnessed on their rounds and settling more often for responding to calls that came in. But it was a subtle enough shift to escape much notice. \"There were still police doing police things,\" he said.\n\nA former Seattle police officer who was on the force during the consent-decree period explained how this dynamic often played out. (Like the other officers quoted in this story, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because his current position does not authorize him to speak with the media.) Among the elements of the city's consent decree was a broadened definition of \"use of force,\" which required reporting even an arrestee's complaint that handcuffs had caused physical pain. The decree also put in place an early warning system for officers racking up use-of-force incidents at a high rate. Many officers concluded it wasn't worth the hassle to arrest someone for relatively minor offenses, such as public disturbance or loitering, the former officer said.\n\nThese 68 videos show clear apparent instances of police officers escalating violence during protests. Here's what we learned about each case.\n\n\"I made two arrests two days in a row one week, and both turned into paperwork clusterfucks,\" the former officer said. \"When you've accumulated two or three use-of-force complaints in a week, you'll say: 'I just need to stop. I need to stop doing this.'\" Among the sort of policing that fell away, the former officer said, was officers' routine sweeps of areas where drug users congregated, to check their names for outstanding warrants, which would often net suspects in local burglaries. Meanwhile, he said, several dozen of the department's more proactive-minded officers responded to the new rules and paperwork by simply deciding to \"lateral out\" to a job in another police department.\n\nAnd police officers opposed to the consent decree that McGinn negotiated didn't just engage in underpolicing - they found an even more effective way to protest it: The union endorsed his opponent in the 2013 election, Ed Murray, and made a $15,000 campaign expenditure on his behalf. After Murray narrowly defeated McGinn, the new interim police chief he installed dismissed claims of misconduct against a group of officers. (Murray later resigned amid allegations of child sexual abuse. He denied the charges and was not prosecuted, though the city did settle at least one civil case filed by a man accusing Murray of abuse.)\n\nIn Seattle, the pullback correlated with a rise in street crimes and disorder. The city has relatively high rates of property crime, and it has become so well known for highly visible homelessness and drug use that a local TV station owned by the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group aired an hourlong documentary last year called \" Seattle Is Dying .\"\n\nBut the post-consent-decree pullback did not result in a rise in violent crime in the city, whose homicide rate remained very low compared with other large cities. In this, the city is representative of a broader trend, according to two recent de-policing studies. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, and Joel Wallman, the director of research for the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, examined the impact of arrest rates in 53 large cities on homicide rates from 2010 to 2015. They found that arrests, especially for less serious crimes such as loitering, public intoxication, drug possession and vagrancy, had already been dropping over that period, even prior to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014. And they found that in nearly all of those cities, the declining arrest rates did not result in higher rates of violence. To put it another way: Over the first half of the past decade, many cities shifted away from the \"broken windows\" style of policing popularized in New York under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, but even as they did so, violent crime continued to decline in most places, as it has since the early 1990s.\n\nSimilarly, a June working paper by Roland Fryer, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Tanaya Devi found that in most cities where police have been under federal investigations in recent decades, a step that often leads to consent decrees, rates of violent crime have not increased - just as they didn't in Seattle.\n\nThere was one set of exceptions in the latter study, though. Federal investigations and de-policing did correlate with a sharp rise in violent crime in cities that had experienced what the study referred to as \"viral\" incidents: a high-profile, highly controversial instance of police using deadly force against a civilian - precisely what several cities are contending with today.\n\nIn Baltimore in 2015, the underpolicing was so conspicuous that even some community activists who had long pushed for more restrained policing were left desperate as violence rose in their neighborhoods. \"We saw a pullback in this community for over a month where it was up to the community to police the community. And quite frankly, we were outgunned,\" the West Baltimore community organizer Ray Kelly told me in 2018. In fact, the violence got so out of hand - a 62% increase in homicides over the year before - that even some street-level drug dealers were pleading for greater police presence: One police commander, Melvin Russell, told New York magazine in 2015 that he'd been approached by a drug dealer in the same area where Gray had been arrested, who asked him to send a message back to the police commissioner. \"We know they still mad at us,\" the dealer said. \"We pissed at them. But we need our police.\"\n\nOne veteran Baltimore police officer said that the 2015 pullback was the result of almost instantaneous demoralization that spread across the department. Officers resented the lack of official direction and protective equipment during the riots, he said, and the charges against the six officers involved in Gray's arrest, which the Baltimore state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, had delivered in a ringing tone from the steps of the city's War Memorial Building. The resentment was exacerbated by the fact that Mosby's own office had recently requested heightened enforcement in exactly the area where Gray was arrested.\n\n\"You were responding to calls - if an old lady was being robbed, you were going to stop them. But as far as being very aggressive and doing proactive patrolling of the sort that Mosby had demanded, that was over,\" the officer said. \"We did exactly what you wanted! And a horrible accident occurred.\n\nThe pullback carried local resonance: Baltimore had been the site of the nation's last major police strike, in 1974, when nearly half of the department's 2,800 officers joined a strike by sanitation workers, jail guards, highway repairers, and park and zoo maintenance workers over wage increases deemed inadequate amid rising inflation. \"I'm a cop/my life is on the line/but not for 5.5%\" and \"I will not die for 5 1/2%,\" read signs on the picket line. After a spike in looting and arson, the governor sent in state police as reinforcements. The strike ended after four days. The city delivered a larger wage increase the next year, but the police commissioner fired more than 80 officers for organizing the strike and revoked the union's collective-bargaining rights, which were not restored until 1982.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, a formal strike was out of the question. The local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police sent no signals about a pullback, the veteran officer said. There was no need to - the cues coming from other officers, particularly from more veteran ones toward more junior ones, were enough. \"They were very careful about not saying anything official or unofficial that you should lay down and not do your job. But the writing was on the wall,\" the officer said. \"It was the sense that you need to look out for yourselves and not put yourself in harm's way or put yourself at any [legal] risk, because you aren't going to have the support of the department.\"\n\nThe role of underpolicing amid the rising tide of violence was evident even to the staunchest advocates for reining in the police. \"Police 'not doing their job,' I don't think can be the sole explanation,\" Grandpre, the local activist, told me in 2019. \"I do think, however, there is a perception among people in street organizations that the police are not doing their job. And that perception creates the feeling that they could get away with it now, when there was a feeling they could not get away with it four or five or six years ago.\"\n\nBaltimore became the classic example of the exception observed by the Fryer and Devi study: a city in which a \"viral\" incident brings about a federal investigation into policing practices correlated with a notable increase in violent crime. The other five exceptions cited in Fryer and Devi's paper were Chicago; Cincinnati; Riverside, California; and Ferguson, Missouri, where the fatal 2014 shooting of Michael Brown led Sam Dotson, then the St. Louis police chief, to coin the phrase \"Ferguson effect\" to describe rising violence in his own, larger city following protests.\n\nIn their paper, Fryer and Devi note that spikes in violence were not observed in cities that had a viral incident but no ensuing federal investigation, such as North Charleston, South Carolina, following the 2015 police shooting of Walter Scott as he ran from an officer. In those cases, Fryer said in an interview, police seem able to compartmentalize the criticism of the incident, rather than see it as an indictment of the entire force. \"If the police feel like the management has their back, which is what they tend to feel if there's a viral incident and no investigation, then they continue on,\" Fryer said.\n\nFryer said he was also struck to find that investigations not sparked by viral incidents also did not produce spikes in violent crime. But something about the combination of the two - a viral incident leading to an investigation - seemed to lead to police pullbacks and higher rates of violence. \"What I've heard [officers] say is: 'I don't want to be the next YouTube sensation. All I want is my pension. I've got a family to worry about.' They're putting their life on the line to do this work, and if it's not going to be appreciated then they're pulling back,\" he said. \"It's incredible the amount of media intensity that happens when there's a viral incident. It's not that investigations are different, they're the same, but it's the view that, If I make a mistake under these circumstances, it's going to be career altering.\"\n\nRosenfeld, the co-author of the study showing how little impact de-policing has had on violent crime in most cities in recent years, told me that Fryer and Devi's study was \"complementary\" to his own in identifying an exception to the overall trend in a handful of cities. \"Those are cities where the community's relationship with police is enormously fraught, and in those situations, people tend to withdraw from the police and take matters into their own hands,\" he said. \"It's not just what police are or aren't doing that could be provoking more incidents. It's also the community reacting to police brutality.\"\n\nIn Baltimore, the pullback has persisted five years later, in an evolved form. The resentment that police harbored over the charges against the six officers has dissipated; none of the cases ended with a conviction. Now, the veteran officer said, the continued decline in arrest rates and proactive-policing levels are driven more by uncertainty over what is allowed under the city's new consent decree, even after multiple training sessions. Some of the sessions have been useful, the officer said - for instance, on the rules around searches and seizures. But officers are still uncertain about the expanded use-of-force definitions, he said, which include forcible handcuffing, as in Seattle, and about when and how they are allowed to clear crowds from major drug corners, so they often choose to simply drive by them. \"The officers are confused. I have no idea what I can do and what I can't do, and I've been an officer for 20 years,\" he said. \"The good members of the community want us to do our job. But the small number of noisy people who are getting in trouble over and over are out there dictating policy to the detriment of the city.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the 2015 surge in violence has yet to ebb five years later. The department's efforts to win back the trust of the community have been hugely undermined by a police-corruption scandal that resulted in guilty pleas and convictions for a dozen officers, with charges outstanding against several more, the subject of a newly released book by two local journalists. The city finished last year with 348 homicides, even more than in 2015, and is on pace for nearly that many this year.\n\nThe hope remains that, over time, the consent-decree reforms will curb abuses and help rebuild community trust in the department, which in turn will make it easier to solve and prevent violent crimes. Departments - notably, Los Angeles' - have managed to climb back from riots and scandal with the help of a consent decree while presiding over a reduction in violence.\n\nBut that hope is qualified for some reformers by local nuances. For one thing, Baltimore's consent decree requires that the city hire more police officers, in contravention of activist calls to greatly reduce spending on policing. For another thing, Grandpre notes that the consent decree has made it harder for his organization and others to demand specific state-level reforms, such as increasing funding for witness protection in Baltimore. When they went to Annapolis to testify for that, the response was essentially that this was the purview of the federal government, given the consent decree. \"It's a barrier to offer[ing] more targeted forms of police-community reform,\" Grandpre said. \"They focus on abstract professional notions in ways that deter the more substantive reforms on the ground.\"\n\nThe nationwide protests that erupted after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd suggest that his death may have given rise to something relatively new, the equivalent of a viral incident in each individual American city. And in some cities where municipal leaders have supplied the other ingredient researchers identified - signaling their support for broad reforms - police pullbacks appear well under way.\n\nDuring the protests that followed Floyd's death, Seattle police withdrew from their precinct house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, allowing the area to become an \"autonomous\" zone. In the following days, they were slow to respond to several emergency calls in or near the zone, including a shooting inside the area that left a 19-year-old dead and another injured. (The police attributed their slow response to having been impeded by the zone's occupiers.) Many officers have also refused to uncover their badge numbers, deterring identification.\n\nMcGinn has been observing from the sidelines as the city, now under the leadership of Mayor Jenny Durkan, appears to be experiencing its own version of a silent strike protesting the activists and Durkan, who initially said the autonomous zone had a \" block-party atmosphere . There s a lot of evidence that the police today are not fully under control of the mayor. No mayor can admit that, but all evidence seems to suggest that,\" McGinn said in July, just before police finally moved to clear the autonomous zone. \"They're engaging in their own version of civil disobedience - showing that they're the thin blue line and that without them there will be chaos. That's what they believe and they want to go out there and prove it.\"\n\nIn New York, the 205 shootings in June were the most for that month in the city since 1996, and shootings are up 72% over the first seven months of the year compared with last year. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has said that his officers are feeling constrained by a new bill passed by the City Council that makes it a crime to put their knee into someone's back and are feeling demoralized by a general lack of public support. Regardless of motivations, what is beyond dispute is that arrest rates have fallen sharply in the city since May, while violence has been rising, In the week of May 24, according to The New York Times , there were 113 gun arrests citywide; by early June, the weekly tally was down to 71, and by late June, it was at 22.\n\n\"There's a slowdown without a doubt, and NYPD is allowing it,\" the chairman of the City Council's public safety committee, Donovan Richards, told the   Times . \"We've seen what the NYPD will do when they want to keep record low shootings over the course of the last few years. Every year, we're breaking this record, we're breaking this record. There's not an effort being made at this point.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, where protests over Floyd's death have lingered longer than in most other cities, 15 people fell victim to homicide in July, the city's deadliest monthly toll in decades, while police have been fuming over the newly elected district attorney's decision to dismiss many of the cases against protesters, which has in turn led to reports of disengagement by officers . All told, homicides in the 50 largest cities are up by nearly a quarter over the first half of the year, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, while many other crimes, including robberies and burglaries, are generally down.\n\nThe former Seattle officer predicted that any pullbacks would follow the same template they had in his city. Officers with less than 10 years of experience who still want to engage in proactive policing might move to other departments. \"They're going to leave, because they received the message politically that it's not being supported,\" he said. Officers who have 10 or years or less until retirement will likely stay. Also sticking around will be officers with lengthy records of complaints - \"'internal affairs' jackets that are too ugly\" - because it's hard for them to get hired elsewhere. Something of the sort appears to be under way in Minneapolis, where 65 officers have already left the department this year, well above the usual attrition rate of about 45 a year, according to the Times, and dozens of other officers on the force of about 850 have taken temporary leave since Floyd's death and the ensuing protests.\n\nThe Seattle officer also predicted that officers who remain will scale back by, for instance, taking longer than necessary to handle a 911 call, just to fill their shift. A Washington, D.C., police officer told me he was already seeing signs of such easing back in his department, which has avoided a viral incident on par with the Floyd and Brooks deaths but has faced criticism for its aggressive response to the recent protests. \"I haven't seen anyone say we're not going out because of this, but I have seen people take more time,\" the D.C. police officer said.\n\nThe D.C. officer, like those from Seattle and Baltimore, was quick to underscore how appalled officers were by the video of the death of George Floyd under the knee of the Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin. \"All of my colleagues had a feeling of broken hearts,\" he said. \"It was a sadness.\" What has driven the widespread demoralization among officers, the officers said, was not the public condemnation of Chauvin, but the protests' focus on police in general as the overwhelming target of their ire.\n\nAs many police see it, government and society have failed Black citizens and their neighborhoods on countless levels, and they have left it to the police to reckon with the consequences and then to bear the blame. The blame is especially hard to take, the officers say, when it comes from well-to-do white liberals who have moved to segregated suburbs or kept their kids in heavily white schools, yet are quick to accuse officers of racism. \"It's systemic. But wealthy whites in Northwest [D.C.] see a cop on Fox 5 do something that's awful and they want to blame the cop and keep it moving and not accept the responsibility that we all have,\" the D.C. officer said. \"It's great to Zoom into a City Council hearing and repeat what you heard at your Georgetown class.\n\nFueling the resentment of such criticism is the perception that some well-off critics are untouched by the high levels of violence in the neighborhoods that the officers spend a lot of their time patrolling. The officers also note that - as James Forman Jr. wrote about in his 2017 book, \"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America\" - many residents of these neighborhoods see more of a need for a greater police presence than some activist rhetoric reflects. \"They don't have a stake in the game,\" said the Baltimore officer of the police's more privileged critics. \"Where was the outrage of these people the weekend that 11 people were murdered [in Baltimore]? Instead, people were rioting over the murderous act by this ridiculous asshole,\" Chauvin.\n\nThe Baltimore officer was among those detailed for the protests over George Floyd, which ended up being far more contained than the Freddie Gray protests five years ago, as well as the recent protests in other cities. Still, he said, it was hard to stand there and absorb the anger and scorn. \"It's demoralizing. After 20 years, it's soul-crushing. I know I do good in the community. That's what I do, at great sacrifice to my family and my health. The collateral damage of dealing with horrible, depressing stuff day after day, it adds up,\" he said. \"People are just so angered, and their anger is directed at us, because we are part of the machine and the system that has oppressed them. To have them screaming 'All cops are bad; you're a murderer' is soul-crushing. I know better, but it just is.\"\n\nThere is, in fact, a city that seemed to make it through a recent police pullback and the spike of violent crime that followed, and that can provide a model for mayors who want to pursue policing reforms. Fryer and Devi's research paper cites Chicago's 2016 homicide surge , alongside Baltimore's, as an instance in which a police pullback accompanied a sharp rise in violent crime. In Chicago's case, the pullback followed charges against the officers involved in the killing of Laquan McDonald. The 17-year-old was shot 16 times by police in 2014, but the video of the shooting wasn't released until a year later. Chicago saw its homicide tally spike from 478 in 2015 to 756 in 2016, an increase nearly as large as that suffered by Baltimore from 2014 to 2015.\n\nBut unlike Baltimore, Chicago saw its homicide tally retreat after the spike, with three straight years of declines , down to 482 last year - still one of the highest rates in the country, but 35% lower than in 2016. And the declines were happening as the city was entering into its own federal consent decree stemming from McDonald's killing.\n\nThe city's current deputy mayor for public safety, Susan Lee, says the improved trajectory could be attributed partly to Eddie Johnson, the police superintendent installed by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel in April 2016. Johnson grew up in one of the city's most notorious housing projects and had sufficient credibility with many officers to rally them back to the job at hand. (He was fired late last year after officers found him sleeping in his car after drinking.)\n\nAdditionally, a coalition of several dozen local organizations and foundations made a unified investment in violence reduction. \"The horrendous spike in murders brought a citywide response that was about embracing [the Police Department] but also about the community stepping up and saying, 'We need to do more,'\" Lee told me.\n\nThis success story had a disheartening coda, though. Amid this year's nationwide rise in violence, Chicago is now experiencing one of the worst increases of all, putting it on pace to near its 2016 total, alongside several high-profile episodes of looting downtown, most recently again on Aug. 10 .\n\nLee cautioned against seeing all apparent police withdrawals through the lens of rank-and-file resentment. In some cases, she said, officers are still operating under the limits imposed by COVID-19 concerns, or are simply weary from protest details, which, along with coronavirus quarantines, have been pulling many of them from their beat. \"We've had a transition from the closures to reopening ramping up, and there's a level of uncertainty from that. They're working 12-hour days for multiple days. There's a sheer exhaustion factor. All of that would translate into folks saying, 'Officers are not working as hard.'\" The key to making sure that officers were not edging into a more deliberate withdrawal, Lee said, lay with command staff. \"It all goes back to supervision and whether those frontline supervisors are holding people accountable for their work product.\"\n\nBack in Baltimore, the next person to face the threat of police pulling back from the job they are paid to do is likely going to be Brandon Scott, the 36-year-old City Council president who narrowly won the recent Democratic mayoral primary and is thus nearly guaranteed to win the November general election. Scott, who grew up in one of the city's most homicide-plagued neighborhoods, watched from his perch as chairman of the council's public safety committee as the recent pullback occurred and violence filled the void. He told me that he was confident that he would be able to address the threat of withdrawal, should it arise again, partly because of the personal ties he's built over the years with many in the department. \"Leaders lead,\" he said. \"You have to have leaders that are able to communicate to multiple groups of people, who have relationships with different groups of people. It doesn't mean they'll always be happy with everything you do, but they'll appreciate that you did it in a thoughtful way.\"\n\nAnd what if officers in Baltimore, or elsewhere, still hold back? \"Most of these places have failure-to-obey-lawful-duty provisions, and they should follow them,\" Scott said. \"You signed up to protect people.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

For protesters we talked to, that's one more reason to be on the street. \"If it's not police beating us up, it's us dying in a hospital from the pandemic,\" one said.\n\nby Akilah Johnson\n\nThe U.S. Response to COVID-19\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

Couldn't get proper treatment. Lived in crowded conditions, so social distancing was hard to do. And they were still forced to go to work and be put in harm's way.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected?

The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\nWhen speaking out against the loss of black lives, it is tough to separate those who die at the hands of police from those who die in a pandemic that has laid bare the structural racism baked into the American health system. Floyd himself had tested positive for the coronavirus. Eighteen black protesters interviewed by ProPublica were well aware that black lives were being lost to the virus at more than twice the rate of others, and that societal barriers have compounded for generations to put them at higher risk.\n\nIt was fueling their desire to protest and their anxiety about joining the crowd. But they flocked to the White House on Tuesday afternoon, one day after peaceful protesters there were tear-gassed so that President Donald Trump could hold up a bible for a photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church. There were tanks on the streets, along with a battalion of federal agents, military troops and police. Many of the protesters said they were willing to sacrifice their bodies, either to violence or the virus, to be heard.\n\nIn front of the White House stood Caleb Jordan, who turns 21 on Saturday. He showed up with an overstuffed backpack to make sure his 62-year-old grandmother, Carolyn Jackson, had enough water to drink and a hoodie to protect her arms in case of violence. \"I don't know what I would do if anything happened to her,\" he said. Some people had on masks. Some did not. Some pulled their masks down to talk or breathe. \"I'm not comfortable with that,\" he said. She's got a chronic lung condition, and he had been so worried about her catching the coronavirus in the past few months that he wouldn't hug her. But then she mentioned that she drove by the protests on Sunday, and immediately he asked, \"Why didn't you take me?\"\n\nHe had been losing sleep over what he was seeing in social media and on TV, having nightmares in which he was fighting a \"real-Jim-Crow-looking white guy in a white button-down shirt, black tie, sleeves rolled up.\" His mom told him he was fighting racism. \"It's like obstacle after obstacle,\" he said. \"If it's not police beating us up, it's us dying in a hospital from the pandemic. I'm tired of being tired. I'm so tired, I can't sleep.\" It was something he continued thinking about until he couldn't help himself, sending a text at 3 a.m. asking his grandmother if they could attend together. \"I thought about it and said, 'This is a teachable moment,' \" she recalled.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nSo Jackson took the day off from her job as an accountant at a hospice organization and put on some peace sign earrings and a T-shirt from the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March. On the car ride into the city, her grandson asked about her struggles with race. She explained what it's like being a professional black woman with over 30 years experience who still feels overlooked for opportunities because of questions about her qualifications. Her awareness of being treated differently dates back to how her white paternal grandmother favored her lighter-skinned cousins. She found solace in her black maternal grandmother, who would comb her hair while she sat between her legs. Jackson wants her grandson to feel that kind of comfort from her.\n\nThat desire extends to her mission to help the black community understand palliative care is an option that can offer dignity and support at the end of life. \"Because when people hear hospice, their hands go up and they say, 'I don't want to hear it.'\" She's also heard that resistance when it comes to getting tested for the coronavirus; she has gotten tested twice and plans to get tested again. She feared being exposed on Tuesday, but being here with her grandson was too important to miss. \"We internalized a lot with my generation,\" she said, \"but I think it's important for him to see this.\"\n\nN.W.A.'s \"Fuck Tha Police\" blared from a nearby speaker outside St. John's Episcopal Church until an interfaith group of men and women bowed their heads and began to pray. Among them was Timothy Freeman, pastor at Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, who wore a brightly colored kente cloth-inspired mask, its vibrant yellows and reds standing in stark contrast to his ministerial black suit and white clerical collar.\n\nFreeman, 42, knows eight people who have been diagnosed with the virus; one died. For two weeks, a sick friend had a fever and could barely move from fatigue but refused to get tested, running through all the scenarios of what might happen if he had it: What if he wound up isolated in an ICU with no one to advocate at his bedside? Another sick friend worried an ambulance would take him to a hospital that he didn't trust. These conversations, the pastor said, are always infused with an awareness of the medical system's record of neglect and abuse of black people, from dismissing their pain to using their bodies for research without consent. The virus has forced this all top of mind.\n\nA licensed occupational therapist for 19 years who spent a decade managing a skilled rehab facility, Freeman said he has seen racial disparities in health care firsthand and that access to adequate insurance coverage is crucial. \"I have seen diagnostic tests not performed ... and hospitalizations cut extremely short - or not happen at all - because of insurance.\" COVID-19 is affecting black and brown people in disproportionate numbers, \"and not just because we're black and brown, but because of the social and economic conditions people are forced to live in,\" he said.\n\n\"All of it comes together. What happened with George Floyd publicized to the world the experience that we live,\" he said. \"It's a conglomeration of everything.\"\n\nA block away from the prayer group, Elizabeth Tsehai, 53, drove slowly in her BMW SUV, honking her horn, as federal agents in riot gear began to march past the crowd just behind her. She had a Black Lives Matter T-shirt displayed on the dashboard and a bike rack on the top of her car that she joked made her look like the \"caricature of a soccer mom.\"\n\nShe stopped her car on the road and remained there as protesters to her left took a knee. There was some heckling from the crowd but no one was in anybody's face. A Secret Service agent warned her to move. Her response: \"Arrest me. I can't breathe!\" Agents then pulled her from her car and to the ground and handcuffed her. \"I didn't resist because I know they just arrest you for resisting arrest,\" she said. \"But the minute they pulled me up on my feet, I was talking all kinds of trash.\"\n\nElizabeth Tsehai was stopped in her car, honking in support of protesters, when Secret Service agents pulled her out and handcuffed her.\n\nHer car was left unlocked in the middle of the street, where it was protected by protesters. She was questioned and released. She said agents told her they were afraid she was going to hit protesters because people have been using their cars as weapons. They told her to move it and leave. The Secret Service did not respond to questions about this incident.\n\n\"Ordinarily, I would not get involved,\" Tsehai said. But George Floyd's death was enraging, as were \"all of the things that came before it.\"\n\nAll of the things.\n\nHow a white nurse looked her up and down when she arrived at the hospital to give birth to her son and sneered, \"Can we help you?\"\n\nHow her brothers, who live in Minneapolis, recount being pulled over by police for driving while black.\n\nHow a black man couldn't watch birds in Central Park last week without having the police called on him.\n\n\"The pandemic is hitting black people hard and exposing these structural inequalities,\" she said. \"Then on top of that, you get Amy Cooper ... weaponizing her white privilege at a time when he might end up in jail, where infection is rife.\n\n\"But when they manhandled protesters who were peaceful, that was a bridge too far,\" said Tsehai, who grew up in Ethiopia under an authoritarian regime during a period known as Red Terror. She didn't know life without a curfew until she moved to the United States to attend Georgetown University 35 years ago.\n\nMedicare's COVID-19 testing costs reached over $2 billion in 2022. The growing costs concern some experts, who say financial incentives and a lack of regulation early in the pandemic led to fraud and overspending.\n\n\"Moments like this are quite unusual,\" she said. They can also inspire change, a message she shared with her children, ages 12 and 14, when recounting her ordeal with them. \"I want these children to live in a different world. It's not enough to read about it and get outraged and talk about it at the dinner table. Silence makes you complicit.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

      "text": "How Police Have Undermined the Promise of Body Cameras\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn't understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department?\n\nMiguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father's friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. \"It's as if I sensed something was going to happen,\" she says. \"I was calling him, calling him, calling him: 'Miguel, come home. Come home.'\"\n\nHis parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards' landlord, who hadn't seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him.\n\nRichards' death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced \"for clear viewing of the event as a totality.\" And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes \"the use of deadly force is unavoidable,\" the police commissioner at the time, James O'Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is \"nothing short of exceptional.\" And, he added, \"releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.\"\n\nRichards' parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney's office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn't they know about their son's death?\n\nWhen body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation.\n\nYet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given wide latitude to run their departments as they wish and to police - and protect - themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York's, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct.\n\nEven when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don't always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department said it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents \"within 30 days.\" There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice.\n\nAnd the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

(Mayor Eric Adams' spokesperson did not make him available for comment.)\n\nFor a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases - or about 42%.\n\nThis article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect.\n\nTo Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America's quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. \"Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,\" he says. \"Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to 'silver bullet' syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.\" He later added, \"We just said to police departments: 'Here's this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.' It shouldn't be a surprise that they're going to use it in a way that most benefits them.\"\n\nJeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. \"Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,\" he says, \"should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.\"\n\nWhen full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder. (Charges were dropped after two mistrials.) And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with \"a weapon.\" In fact, footage released by the district attorney - who charged the officer with murder - shows that the man was sitting in his own car.\n\nIn New York, Miguel Richards' parents weren't the only ones who had doubts about the department's claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn't include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn't include footage from other police units that responded.\n\nRuth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department's own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting.\n\nNow, watching the video the department released of Richards' shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department's edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. \"What's your name, man?\" one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. \"You are seconds away from getting shot,\" one officer said. \"Do you want to die?\" A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired.\n\nLowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the \"NYPD is committed to being as transparent as possible.\" But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department's records officers: \"I must deny access to these records.\"\n\nBody-worn cameras were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown's life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown's mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. \"Please,\" she begged Missouri legislators, \"let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his plans to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they're paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama, an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man's femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have refused to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause \"civil unrest\" and that the officers could face \"embarrassment.\" But a lawyer for the man's family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. \"Did you get a bite?\" an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. \"Sure did, heh, heh,\" the K-9 officer responded.\n\nThe secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy's mother, reaching to help him, begged, \"Please, please do not kill my son!\"\n\nThe footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin's conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. \"Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,\" says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, \"the city never burns. We'd have a downtown still. It's a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.\"\n\nA Department of Justice report from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn't make the footage public or mete out punishment.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in Memphis, Tennessee, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly abused residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others knew they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers.\n\nSome politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the announcement with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts.\n\nThe way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes.\n\n\"This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,\" Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn't say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is \"not a public record subject to disclosure,\" thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina.\n\nIn 2021, York County sheriff's deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, \"We never release that footage.\"\n\nThe pattern has become so common across the country - public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal - that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia's civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the \"body-cam head fake.\" And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world's largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong.\n\nNew York's adoption of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department's aggressive \"stop and frisk\" policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability - body-worn cameras - in passing.\n\n\"My head snapped when I heard the words,\" Scheindlin recalled this year. \"I thought, 'That could be a useful remedy!'\"\n\nTwo months later, Scheindlin issued a historic ruling that New York's stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were \"uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.\" Scheindlin laid out three ways the cameras would help: \"First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.\" She continued, \"Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.\"\n\nBut in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin's ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community's answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure.\n\nOfficers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would \"show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,\" according to a separate NYU survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point.\n\nWhen the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process - in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision).\n\nThe policy blunted the technology's potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements - something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video.\n\nThe policy was \"so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers' civil rights,\" Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times. \"Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.\"\n\nStill, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O'Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O'Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. \"I'm totally convinced now that this is the way forward,\" he said. \"These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.\"\n\nThen the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship.\n\n\"This is an historic day for New York City,\" de Blasio said, with O'Neill by his side. \"This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.\"\n\nFive months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it.\n\nDisclosing the full footage would be an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" the department wrote. Whose privacy - the dead man's or the officers' - was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could \"endanger the life or safety of any person.\"\n\nThe letter came from the department's legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. \"They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,\" Byrne told NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, \"most of this footage\" would never be made public.\n\nLowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department's various explanations for its denials \"pissed me off,\" Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department's kneejerk secrecy. \"There's a good side to the department,\" he says, \"but there's always been a self-serving dark side to it too.\"\n\nIn response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage \"in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.\" But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards' parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public.\n\nPublic disclosure of footage isn't the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers' allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said, \"I'm sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.\"\n\nThe agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them - along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election - staged a huge protest outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases when it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it.\n\nMany civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency's ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano's hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 - the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. \"We talked about it in detail\" at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. \"We thought, 'Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.'\"\n\nNapolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn't appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight.\n\nAs with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department \"liaison\" unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn't cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department's cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn't know an officer's name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage.\n\nPerhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board's investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. \"If you were setting up a system to be shitty,\" one agency insider says, \"this is the system you'd create.\"\n\nAt times, the department's animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department's legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to \"bomb the room\" when only board officials were there, which would have \"solved everything.\" (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn't recall saying that, but added, \"On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.\")\n\nNapolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn't exist - only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn't true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly 1 of every 5 cases.\n\nNapolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department's stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department's system where footage is stored. That's how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers' accounts. Chicago's oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn't see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage - and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, \"freaked\" out.\n\n\"It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,\" Napolitano added, referring to the mayor's tenuous relationship with the police. \"In a dispute between CCRB and NYPD, City Hall always chose the NYPD. Always.\"\n\n\"I don't agree,\" de Blasio says. \"The tension between the CCRB and the NYPD is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.\" He went on, \"The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You're not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.\"\n\nWhile the department fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department's own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted.\n\nAs the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards' nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand.\n\nDepartment guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to \"isolate and contain\" the person. \"The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,\" department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor's permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis.\n\nAt first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. \"Look, we could shut the door,\" Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser.\n\nTwo officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards' right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. \"Hold up,\" one of the ESU officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. \"I don't know if it's a toy or a gun,\" Murphy quickly added.\n\nAs the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards' room. \"Do you want to take him down now?\" Ramos asked them. \"Yeah,\" they both answered.\n\nAt nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. \"Isolate and contain,\" the dispatcher told the officers. \"Use nonlethal force whenever possible.\" As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming - who later said Richards was raising his arm - fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It's impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming's camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight.\n\nThe shooting of Miguel Richards was the first to be recorded by NYPD body cameras. Police Commissioner James O'Neill wrote in an internal message that releasing footage would show officers' \"restraint in the use of force.\" Below are clips from the videos the police initially released. They contain graphic content.\n\nFleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.)\n\nThe internal investigators asked the officers to explain. \"We kind of handle everything on our own,\" Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had \"situationally changed\" and prompted the decision to \"take him at that point.\" Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. \"I perceived that his intentions were lethal,\" Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn't fully grasped Richards' mental state. \"Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?\" Fleming asked.\n\nWhen the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an \"EDP\" - or an emotionally disturbed person - with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, \"We wanted to, like, end it.\"\n\nWhile the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been \"justified\" in shooting - because they were facing an \"individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm\" - the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report noted , \"was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.\" And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department's full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, \"The Secret Files.\" The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing.\n\nBut in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has absolute power over punishment. In March 2019, O'Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O'Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.)\n\nIt would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the \"public is vested with an inherent right to know\" and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron's organization.\n\nShe received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before.\n\n\"He's still alive,\" Fleming said.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" Murphy replied. \"Just fucking cuff him.\"\n\nThe officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor.\n\nThey searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. \"It's some fucking little thing,\" he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots.\n\nOutside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, \"They were just hurling fucking shots.\"\n\nThe NYPD initially withheld the footage of the aftermath of the Richards shooting. Below are clips from the videos that a state judge later ordered released. They contain graphic content.\n\nLowenkron was shocked. Officers had shot a young man and roughly handled him as he bled to death. \"The utter disrespect,\" Lowenkron says. \"It was a horror movie.\"\n\nNew York Lawyers for the Public Interest would go on to share the footage with journalists. It would also use the footage in a webinar for mental health advocates in November 2020. \"The point,\" Lowenkron told me, \"was to get more people engaged on this issue: transforming New York and this country's response to people in crisis.\"\n\nBut by then, for another man in distress, it was too late.\n\nIn April 2019, one month after O'Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick.\n\nThe circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: \"I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, 'Didn't I read this already?'\"\n\nThis time, though, the victim's family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn't ignore.\n\nBut despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn't share the footage - or any other records - with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department's longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department's internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board's investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident.\n\nIn the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 - more than a year and a half after the killing - and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron's organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage \"in bad faith.\"\n\nWhat it showed was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, \"Why are you in my home?\" One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. \"We ain't gonna tase him,\" Davis said in the video.\n\nThompson didn't listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. \"No, no - don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,\" Davis said, pushing his partner's arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.)\n\nThere was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick's apartment. \"Who's injured?\" a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: \"Nobody. Just a perp.\"\n\nWith all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers - which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call.\n\nThis September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge wrote that she had \"serious doubts\" about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department's refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished.\n\n\"That should not be tolerated,\" says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. \"Both CCRB and NYPD are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.\"\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage - the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd's life.\n\nNapolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage - and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.)\n\n\"The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the CCRB from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the NYPD,\" an internal agency memo warned . \"The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a BWC program intended primarily to aid oversight.\"\n\nWe just said to police departments: 'Here's this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it' It shouldn't be a surprise that they're going to use it in a way that most benefits them.\n\nNapolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department's absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department's withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency has \"publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to BWC footage.\"\n\nThis spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn't be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. \"There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen\" in policing, Williams told me. \"But if we're not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the NYPD, that doesn't make this conversation any easier.\"\n\nThe Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department \"does not fear transparency.\" But the official argued that it would be an \"insurmountable obstacle\" to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months.\n\nThe city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers - the highest total in five years.\n\nWith footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing report about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin's expectations, police supervisors weren't using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100% of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37% of the stops were unconstitutional.\n\n\"It was an experiment,\" Scheindlin says, one that didn't anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. \"That troubles me,\" she says. \"It should always be somebody independent.\"\n\nIn interviews with a half-dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn't committed to using footage for accountability. \"Body cams are essential, if done right,\" says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. \"They are a game changer.\" He added, \"If there's a problem, you flag - and potentially there's discipline. But that's not happening in most cases.\" Instead, he says, body cameras have become \"an exercise in just work they have to do. It's a culture thing.\"\n\nRudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department's compliance with Scheindlin's now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. \"I watch a lot of body-cam videos,\" Hall told me. \"I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.\"\n\n\"Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,\" says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. \"The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren't a lot of discussions about it. The NYPD needs to do a lot better.\"\n\nOne of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, recommended that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That's essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a \"critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,\" says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate.\n\nFour auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. \"If officers know they're being viewed, if supervisors know they're being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,\" says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city's civilian oversight agency - which has direct access to footage - noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to \"the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.\" The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it's the police chief who has the final say on discipline.\n\nDuring his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department's 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. \"It was CompStat for constitutional policing,\" Schlanger says, referring to the department's data-heavy program for tracking crime. \"If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we'd work to help them. It made a difference.\"\n\nThe department quietly ended the review program last year.\n\nA civil suit on behalf of Miguel Richards' estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. \"I want answers,\" his mother told me, \"and haven't been able to get them.\"\n\nThe three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for \"extremely brave and tactically sound action\" in the Richards shooting, noting that \"the officers had no choice but to open fire.\"\n\nThe officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit - whose help he told department investigators he didn't need - is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental health crisis.\n\nIt's not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards' death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases.\n\nOn a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. \"I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,\" he says in Spanish. \"Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.\" But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife.\n\nThe officers shot him 28 seconds after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. \"This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,\" he said. The officers' \"quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.\"\n\nBut the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since.\n\nRead More\n\nLowenkron's colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail. The department has also withheld the footage from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, per the practice of sharing records with the agency only after its own investigation is done.\n\nOn Dec. 5, weeks after we sent questions to the department about that practice, the department signed a memorandum of understanding with the board to send footage to it within 90 days of a request.\n\nBut for now, nobody outside the department knows exactly what happened in the de la Cruz shooting, including the family. They have not heard anything from the department. They want to see the footage.\n\nDo you have a tip about policing or another subject?

      "text": "New Louisiana Law Serves as a Warning to Bystanders Who Film Police: Stay Away or Face Arrest\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFour years before a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, prompting nationwide demonstrations, hundreds of people marched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest officers' killing of Alton Sterling in front of a convenience store. Law enforcement responded in force: Officers armed with rifles, body armor and gas masks pushed protesters back and forcibly arrested about 200 people. Some were injured.\n\nA group of 13 protesters and two journalists filed suit, alleging their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested. Eventually, the city agreed to pay them $1.17 million. Photographs and videos taken by protesters, witnesses and journalists were critical in contradicting officers' claims that protesters were the aggressors, said William Most, an attorney for the plaintiffs.\n\nOn Thursday, a Louisiana law will go into effect that will make it a misdemeanor for anyone, including journalists, to be within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer if the officer orders them back. The two independent journalists who sued, whose photos were used to support allegations against the police, said they wouldn't have been able to capture those images if the law had been on the books during the protests.\n\nKaren Savage was working for a news site focused on juvenile justice issues on the second day of the demonstrations in July 2016 when she photographed officers putting a Black man in a chokehold as they detained him. Cherri Foytlin, who was working for a small newspaper and a community media project, said she was within 4 feet when she photographed officers violently dragging a Black man off private property and arresting him.\n\nFoytlin and Savage said they are hesitant to cover protests in Louisiana now that they could face criminal charges if they're too close to an officer. \"I was thinking about how far exactly 25 feet is, and, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's going to be whatever the officer wants it to be,\" Savage said. \"And if it doesn't get to court, it won't matter because they will have accomplished what they wanted, which was to get the cameras away.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of media companies representing a couple dozen Louisiana news outlets, including Verite News, filed suit against Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges and East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III, alleging the law violates the First Amendment .\n\nIn a statement provided Thursday, Murrill said the law ensures law enforcement officers can do their jobs without being threatened or impeded by others. She said she looks forward to \"defending this reasonable response to documented interference with law enforcement.\" State Police spokesperson Capt. Nick Manale declined to comment on the suit; a representative for Moore did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolice buffer laws, as they are commonly known, are relatively new; Louisiana is the fourth state to enact one. Although those states already prohibit interfering with police officers, supporters say buffer laws are necessary to protect police from distrustful, aggressive bystanders. And with advances in cellphone cameras, including zoom lenses, supporters say there's no need to get close to officers in order to record their activities.\n\n\"There's really nothing within a 25-feet span that someone couldn't pick up on video,\" Rep. Bryan Fontenot, R-Thibodaux, the sponsor of Louisiana's bill and a former law enforcement officer, said during a legislative hearing this year. At the same time, he said, \"that person can't spit in my face when I'm making an arrest.\" (He did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFoytlin disagreed. \"You can't even get an officer's badge number at 25 feet. So there's no way to hold anyone accountable.\"\n\nShe and Savage said police targeted them during the Baton Rouge protests because they were taking photos of protesters being slammed to the ground, dragged across the pavement, choked and zip-tied by law enforcement officers. Both journalists were charged with obstructing public rights of way and resisting arrest. Prosecutors did not pursue those charges.\n\nThe journalists and protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the Louisiana State Police, claiming law enforcement officers had used excessive force when arresting them. The Sheriff's Office was dismissed as a defendant because a judge concluded its deputies weren't involved with those arrests. The State Police settled for an undisclosed amount in 2021. The suit against Baton Rouge went to trial in 2023; the city agreed to the million-dollar settlement the day before closing arguments.\n\nNeither the Sheriff's Office nor the Baton Rouge Police Department responded to requests for comment. The Louisiana State Police declined to comment on the lawsuit or protests.\n\nFoytlin said she didn't think the settlement would cause law enforcement agencies to change their tactics; now, she believes they'll be emboldened by the buffer law to crack down more harshly on anyone trying to document officers' actions.\n\n\"From what I saw in Baton Rouge, and what they were able to get away with, I have no doubt that in the future, the consequences of trying to use your free speech or to protest are going to be much harsher,\" she said.\n\nGiven the inconsistent use of police body-worn cameras, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, often the only way people can guard against false charges and prove that officers used excessive force is to film them in close proximity. \"In the absence of video or audio evidence,\" she said, \"it's very difficult to convince anyone that the story occurred in any way different other than what the police report.\"\n\nSuch video was critical in a lawsuit Ahmed handled in which a woman sued two sheriff's deputies over her arrest in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.\n\nThe May 2020 incident started with an anonymous complaint about someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet in a Slidell neighborhood, according to the lawsuit. Deputies Ryan Moring and Kyle Hart showed up at Teliah Perkins' home, writing in an incident report that they saw Perkins ride a motorcycle without a helmet. In Perkins' lawsuit, she denied doing so.\n\nThe conversation quickly became heated. Perkins accused the deputies of harassing her because she is Black; the deputies wrote in the incident report that she was \"irate\" and verbally attacked them .\n\nPerkins called for her son De'Shaun Johnson, then 14, and her nephew, then 15, to come outside and record what was happening, according to the deputies' incident report and the videos. When they did, at least one of the deputies ordered them to go back on the porch, which was more than 25 feet away.\n\nThe boys ignored the deputies and continued to film from about 6 feet away. As Hart forced Perkins to the ground, Moring approached Johnson, shoving him and telling him to move back, according to Perkins' lawsuit and her son's video. When Perkins screamed that she was being choked, Moring stood in front of Johnson to block his view, he later admitted in his deposition. Moring then pointed his Taser at the boy.\n\n\"You can't tase a child,\" Johnson said, according to the lawsuit and the son's video.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Moring responded.\n\nPerkins was arrested for resisting a police officer with force or violence, battery of a police officer, having no proof of insurance and failing to wear a helmet. She was found guilty only on the resisting charge; the others were dropped. She sued the deputies in federal court, claiming they had violated her and her son's rights. An appeals court dismissed Perkins' claims against the deputies, but her son's claim against Moring went to trial. In May, a jury found that Moring had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Johnson and awarded him $185,000, to be paid by the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\nAhmed said she believes the jury was swayed by videos of the incident, which showed \"with clear granularity exactly what was transpiring.\"\n\nMoring denied in court that he intentionally harmed Johnson and has filed a notice of appeal. The deputies' lawyer didn't comment for this story.\n\nIn an interview with Verite News and ProPublica, Perkins said she fears what could have happened had the new law been in effect. The boys could have been arrested when they refused to move back to the porch. And from there, she said, neither would have been able to see or hear what was happening to her.\n\nJohnson, who is about to start his first year at Alabama State University, said the videos he and his cousin took that day are the only evidence of what actually happened. Without them, he said, no one would have believed a 14-year-old boy's claim that a deputy had threatened to shock him with a Taser simply because he was recording with a cellphone.\n\nThere were no police buffer laws when Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in 2020. Seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier stood several feet away and recorded a video that showed Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, causing Floyd to lose consciousness and die. The video was critical in securing Chauvin's conviction for second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.\n\nFloyd's murder fueled protests across the country and efforts to rein in the police. New York City ended qualified immunity , a legal defense used to shield officers from civil liability. Many states restricted the types of force officers can use, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nThe video of Chauvin \"really drew people's attention to how powerful these recordings can be in inspiring protests and legislative action,\" said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \"I think some legislators are now trying to claw back ground that they feel they lost.\"\n\nArizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican from outside Phoenix who authored the first of these bills in 2022, wrote in an op-ed that police officers asked him to introduce it because \"there are groups hostile to the police that follow them around to videotape police incidents, and they get dangerously close to potentially violent encounters.\"\n\nKavanagh's bill, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, prohibited people from filming police within 8 feet. But federal courts across the country have affirmed the right to film the police, and a federal judge struck down the law after a coalition of media outlets and associations sued the state.\n\nIndiana was the next state to pass a similar law. It, like the two others enacted since, doesn't mention filming and requires people to stay at least 25 feet from police. That's based on a controversial theory, often cited to justify police shootings, that someone armed with a knife can cover 21 feet running toward an officer before the officer can fire their weapon.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted in April 2023, an independent journalist sued the city of South Bend after an officer pushed him 25 feet from a crime scene and another officer ordered him to move back another 25 feet. The journalist claimed in the lawsuit that it was impossible to observe the crime scene from that distance. The state denied in court that the journalist's rights were violated.\n\nIn January, a federal judge dismissed the journalist's suit, stating that officers have a right to perform their jobs \"unimpeded.\" The judge said 25 feet is a \"modest distance ... particularly in this day and age of sophisticated technology\" and that \"any effect on speech is minimal and incidental.\" That case is under appeal.\n\nA second lawsuit in Indiana, filed in December by a group of news organizations and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, is pending. They are suing the state attorney general and the prosecutor and sheriff of Marion County, where Indianapolis is located, arguing that it is \"essential for reporters to be within 25 feet of law enforcement in order to record them.\" In a court filing, the defendants have argued that the law doesn't infringe on reporters' ability to record police activities.\n\nFlorida's law went into effect in April. An early version of that bill specified that it did not apply to the act of peacefully recording, photographing or witnessing a first responder, which it called a \"legitimate purpose.\" That language was taken out of the bill before it was passed.\n\nRep. Angela Nixon, D-Jacksonville, proposed changing the bill's name to \" The I Don't Want the World to See the Police Kill an Unarmed Innocent Man Like George Floyd Again, So I Want To Protect Bad Cops and Violate Free Speech Act.\" Her amendment failed.\n\nIf these laws stand up to constitutional challenges, \"we're going to see more states go down this road,\" said Clary of the Reporters Committee.\n\nThe effect of Louisiana's law may be limited in New Orleans, where the police department has been under federal oversight since 2013 due to widespread abuses , including excessive use of force and racial discrimination. New Orleans Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment said the law may violate a court-approved list of reforms, which states that police must allow people to \"witness, observe, record, and/or comment\" on officers' actions, including arrests and uses of force. Another provision says officers cannot arrest anyone for being nearby or recording them except under certain conditions, including risks to the safety of officers or others.\n\nIn response to questions from Verite News and ProPublica, the New Orleans Police Department said it is revising its policies to account for the new law, and those policies could \"restrict officers' actions\" more than the law does. The NOPD said the Department of Justice and a team of court-appointed monitors will review any changes; neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, the Louisiana State Police, which recently sent a contingent of troopers to New Orleans under a directive from Gov. Jeff Landry, does not have to abide by the terms of the consent decree , according to a federal judge. As such, troopers are free to invoke the new law.\n\nThe State Police is being investigated by the Department of Justice following a 2021 Associated Press investigation that uncovered more than a dozen incidents over the past 10 years in which troopers beat Black men and sought to cover up their actions . The State Police didn't respond to a request for comment on those incidents.\n\nWhen asked how troopers are being trained to use the new law, Manale said only that they undergo regular training on how to engage with the public. The State Police, Manale said, \"strives to ensure a safe environment for the public and our public safety professionals during all interactions.\"\n\nDrew Costley of Verite News contributed reporting.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 1, 2024: This story was updated to include a comment from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Louisiana's buffer law.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Keith Ellison got justice for George Floyd. Hereâs what he learned along the way.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nâItâs hard to convict the police,â Minnesota Attorney Gen. Keith EllisonÂ said Â in 2020. Heâd just taken over the investigation into the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, not long after arsonists had just burned down the cityâs third police precinct. Ellisonâs team won the case, and his new book, âBreak the Wheel,â recounts how they did it, as well as how he won a tight re-election campaign amid the backlash to 2020âs police reforms. This is an edited transcript of his conversation with Americana.\n\nAmericana: You get into your re-election last year in the book, and write that âI simply could not allow the lesson to be that prosecuting a cop is political suicide.â What would have happened, had you lost?\n\nKeith Ellison: I was worried that we would be further away from the basic idea of equal protection, the idea that nobody is above the law, nobodyâs beneath the law. Keith Ellison could go and do other things. Iâve never fully identified with the elective office that I happen to be holding at the time. But I felt a tremendous urgency to pull it out in that election, because if I lost, it would scare anybody away from doing what I believe is their duty as a prosecutor.\n\nThat would have been a horrible outcome. So I knocked every door I could. Can you prosecute a police officer and still win your job back as a prosecutor? The answer is yes, but you might have to work your ass off.\n\nAmericana: You write about thinking through the risks when you learned that Gov. Walz was going to give you the case. âWouldnât I be deciding based on how the outcome affects me personally? Isnât that wrong?â\n\nKeith Ellison: My mom was on my mind that day. Do you remember when that horrible tragic incident happened at the Pulse nightclub in Florida? And then John Lewis and some other members of Congress went down to the House floor and did a good old-fashioned sit in?\n\nAmericana: I do.\n\nKeith Ellison: So, I happened to be in my office talking to some constituents at the time. My secretary walks into the room, and she hands me a card with a note on it, which says: âYour mom said get to the House floor.â My mother had called my office. She saw that there was a sit-down on the House floor, and she expected her son to be at the party.\n\nThatâs the kind of woman that she was. She was a justice person. She would have been absolutely appalled by what happened to George Floyd. And she would have wanted me to do what was right.\n\nAmericana: You write this about the prosecutionâs strategy: âWe werenât putting policing on trial. As much as some protesters would have enjoyed that, it probably would have led to an acquittal.â What do you mean?\n\nKeith Ellison: Iâm aware of the larger historical political ramifications of chronic excessive force. Itâs historic and nationwide. Iâve been working on it for a long time. But it wasnât going to achieve the main goal here. And I think it would be slightly unfair, given the fact that I know so many cops who really do care about the safety of their neighbors, and signed up to protect that safety.\n\nIf this experience taught me anything, it is that we donât have to have fundamentally flawed policing in America. We have it, because we will not maintain accountability. We have it because we wonât fire people or discipline them when they violate rules. But Iâm convinced that the institution remains important and is honorable, and that we donât have to live this way.\n\nWe need to acknowledge that we do need armed agents of the state to deal with certain kinds of crime, violent crime. But we donât need armed agents of the state to handle every kind of crime. For example, maybe you can just send out some sort of counterfeit investigator to go deal with the George Floyd matter.\n\nAmericana: The response to that, especially from Republicans, is usually mockery. Oh, you want to send a social worker to a crime scene?\n\nKeith Ellison: This is all stuff Republicans hate because they believe in punishment, for others, not themselves. If youâre a low-income, poor person, they think the way to get you to do something is to inflict maximum pain on you. If youâre talking about themselves, they want the Donald Trump treatment, nothing bad. Nothing bad you do, you ever have to answer for.\n\nAmericana: You got re-elected, but you endorsed the Â Â measure to replace Â Â the Minneapolis police department, and that failed. Whatâs actually improved since 2020?\n\nKeith Ellison: That became one of my comebacks in the debates. âOh, Ellison supported this proposal to get rid of the police department and have a department of public safety.â I said: Well, youâre right. I did. I did support that amendment. But guess what, after it went down, the wiser people took over and we now have a department of public safety, and you have one person who can coordinate all these agencies. Weâre actually interested in saving lives, and youâre interested in trying to win an election through fear.\n\nWe overhauled the police officer standards and training system. The city of Minneapolis has banned no-knock warrants. St. Paul hasnât done a no-knock warrant since 2016. And we have police leadership that, in my opinion, really gets it.\n\nAmericana: You said earlier that we do need âarmed agents of the stateâ to deal with some crimes. Whatâs your response to abolitionists, who believe that policingâs inherently racist, and you make communities safe by funding them?\n\nKeith Ellison: So long as human beings are as they are, there will be rapes, there will be robberies, there will be domestic violence, there will be drive-by shootings. Even if you got rid of any kind of economic and social injustice, explain to me, why did Bernie Madoff rip off a bunch of people? I mean, people do evil things to each other who donât have to. Theyâre not from poor families. Theyâre not racial minorities. And they do bad shit.\n\nYou might not need to bust into Bernie Madoffâs house with guns pointed at his head. But to the degree that human beings hurt each other, you need somebody whoâs going to stop it, and hold them accountable after they do it. Thatâs why I could never get my brain around abolition. When you talk to the abolitionists, theyâll say that theyâre really talking about how a high percentage of the crime that we see is socially caused. Okay. That doesnât mean we get rid of the police. That means we may not need as many as we have now. And thatâs an empirical question.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Can Kamala Harris survive the Republican oppo machine?\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublicans finally know who they need to beat in 15 weeks: Vice President Kamala Harris. Theyâre still figuring out which version of Harris is running.\n\nWill it be the âsmart on crimeâ prosecutor who out-played a generation of Democratic talent in California while tacking to the center when needed? The flat-footed 2020 presidential candidate, whose âconversationsâ about progressive policies ended with zero progressive votes? The 2020 vice presidential winner whose rhetoric â âthere is no vaccine for racismâ â didnât survive the anti-woke backlash?\n\nAs Harris secured the nomination, Republicans waded through all of it, pulling clips and quotes from a 20-year career that brought her into an unpopular Democratic White House. One emerging approach: Attack all of it, blowing up the prosecutor-versus-predator frame she laid out this week by portraying her as soft on crime, pathetically weak on immigration, and a handmaiden to presidential failure.\n\nâOne hundred percent of the Joe Biden record is Kamala Harrisâ,â Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters on Monday. At the same time, the National Republican Senatorial Committee was circulating a memo, urging candidates to emphasize that âHarris is even more progressive than Joe Biden.â\n\nThe real work started on Tuesday, when the Trump campaign shared the mugshots of people arrested in Minnesota, then released on bail after help from the Minneapolis Freedom Fund. On June 1, 2020, as protests and riots broke out in response to the murder of George Floyd, Harris tweeted a link to the fundâs donation portal âto help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesotaâ; ever since, Republicans have linked her to criminals who re-offended after release, and even one man who was acquitted of his original charges.\n\nâThe Minnesota Freedom Fund has no connection with Kamala Harris beyond a single tweet posted to her Twitter account more than four years ago, at a time when people across the political spectrum were galvanized by the murder of George Floyd and the mistreatment of protesters in Minneapolis,â said Jana Kooren, the MFFâs deputy executive director. âWe understand her tweet as a human reaction to that moment, shared by millions of people around the world.â\n\nGOP strategists didnât expect many attacks to land this week. Too much attention swirled around Harris, her own vice presidential options, and President Bidenâs Wednesday night speech about his decision not to run. The Trump campaignâs pollster Tony Fabrizio put out a memo warning that sheâd likely receive an initial bump in public opinion surveys before they could rev up their attack machine.\n\nBut theyâre building for the next 105 days, and combing through a long list of Harris decisions and statements that stand apart from the Biden record. Biden won the 2020 Democratic nomination while ignoring most of the leftâs policy demands. Harris met those demands, and lost it.\n\nâShe has, in the past, endorsed a whole list of left/unpopular positions, chasing the wokeish activist wing of the Dems, and they will be used against her,â wrote author and Liberal Patriot co-founder Ruy Teixeira, in an email. âItâll be interesting to see whether and how much she tries to move to the center on any of this stuff, or just sticks to the abortion/democracy/Trump is a Satanic criminal playbook to rile up the alleged anti-MAGA majority.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nHarrisâs doomed 2020 primary campaign has informed Republican thinking about her ever since. Democrats saw her as potential White House material as soon as she entered Californiaâs 2016 U.S. Senate race; she arrived in Washington as a left-leaning âresistanceâ was underway, defining itself by opposition to Donald Trump.\n\nThat meant opposing the Muslim travel ban, which Harris rallied against, and opposing Trumpâs immigration policy of family separation, which she traveled to a detention center to memetically denounce. Harris never endorsed the campaign to âabolish ICE,â but she came close, saying in 2018 âwe need to probably think about starting from scratch.â\n\nIt also meant endorsing Medicare-for-All, then walking back the endorsement, after being tripped up by questions on whether she, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, would phase out private insurance. The Sanders brain trust knew that would hurt. Its theory, when the senator got multiple 2020 rivals to sign on to his bill, was that they might pander to his voters, but would struggle to defend the policy.\n\nHarris never endorsed the movement to âdefund the police,â but when Los Angeles redirected $250 million from policing to social services, she praised the mayor âfor doing what heâs done.â The cuts were reversed one year later, but Harris stuck with the concept. âIt is outdated, it is wrong-headed thinking, to think that the only way youâre going to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street,â Harris told voters at a September 2020 event in Detroit, recirculating among Republicans this week. âWhat we have to do, and what we will do, is reimagine public safety.â\n\nThat messaging didnât survive the 2021 crime spike seen in Los Angeles and other cities; the softer touch on immigration, and criticism of border agencies, hasnât been heard again since Biden falsely accused border guards of striking Haitian migrants.\n\nOther Democrats had also been forced to own or explain progressive ideas that they embraced in the Trump years. One popular response: Recanting. Texas Rep. Colin Allred, whoâs challenging Cruz, had condemned the idea of a border wall, and now condemns âopen border policies.â Another response: Moving on quietly. In races where theyâre accused of supporting the âdefundingâ of police, Democrats appeared with police and sheriffs in ads and embraced the Biden administrationâs increased law enforcement funding, which was condemned by Black Lives Matter groups who donât have the inter-party influence that they used to.\n\nWhat has the Democratic candidate switch really cost Republicans? They had an entire convention, with four days of earned media, without high-profile attacks on Harris that stood out. If there are bereaved families who blame her for springing criminals out of jail, or furious Arizona ranchers who fear that sheâd open the border, they can still be found. They just wonât be on a big arena stage.\n\nFour years ago, Trumpâs party was frustrated that it had to run against a candidate who never talked about phasing out private insurance or unbuilding ICE. Joe Biden knew he wasnât winning the partyâs college-educated progressive primary voters, and didnât offer what their advocacy groups wanted. When they faded â the Womenâs March, national BLM, protesters demanding a halt to all deportations â Biden wasnât affected.\n\nFormer HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro, who also ran in the 2020 primary, said that the issues Republicans were dredging up now wouldnât be a serious problem for her.\n\nâSo much has changed since 2019,â said Castro. âI seriously doubt that itâs going to have any impact on the voters. Weâve gone through a pandemic, the Dobbs decision came down â the world has changed so much.â\n\nCastro, like Harris, proposed a total rethink of immigration policy â decriminalizing the act of crossing the border. But he didnât see Republicans getting much lift if they brought that up. âWhat voters will remember is the tremendous cruelty of the Trump administration, and this sea of âmass deportation nowâ signs they had at the convention. People will reject how extreme Trump was,â he said.\n\nIn the Bulwark, Marc Caputo reports that Trump strategists want to make âWillie Hortonsâ out of several criminals freed by Harris or the bail fund. âWeâre holding the bucket of paint to define her at a time of our choosing,â said Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita.\n\nIn the Atlantic, Tim Alberta writes that the Trump team now has the election choice that it feared. âThe convention scene was one of a party peaking too early.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "âThey see strengthâ: The Black sports icons shaping Donald Trumpâs take on race, politics, and masculinity\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, FloridaÂ â The road to understanding Donald Trumpâs appeal to a segment of Black America âÂ and his hopes of winning back the presidency by pulling a few precious votes away from Democrats â runs through Trumpâs Black friends, a loose set of iconic sports figures from the 1980s.\n\nThat, at least, was the impression I got from his campaign when I set out to interview Trump about his apparent gains with Black men, a group of voters who some public polls show are more likely to consider backing him this year. Trumpâs aides wouldnât promise a meeting with the former president just yet âÂ instead, they started setting up interviews with older athletes who are supporting his campaign.\n\nNot long after, I got a call from Mets and Yankees slugger Darryl Strawberry. That was the beginning of an odyssey through the heroes and villains of my childhood: Over the next few weeks, I chatted with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, stood backstage at a Trump rally with retired NFL star Lawrence Taylor, and traveled to meet boxing promoter Don King in person. Eventually, I talked to Trump himself.\n\nThese men, now aged 57 to 92, would make unlikely spokespeople for almost any other candidate and they mostly arenât known for their politics. But they do have a lot in common with Trump. They were household names at the same time as Trumpâs New York heyday. They were frequently in the tabloids, often for the wrong reasons, and it took a push from the campaign to persuade some of them to talk to a strange reporter. Nearly all of them had faced serious legal issues, including several criminal convictions.\n\nI met Trump six days after his own felony conviction, in the âGreat Roomâ at Mar-a-Lago. He had just finished a sit-down with Dr. Phil. I asked him, among other things, what I should take away from his warm relationship with the Black men who had been singing his praises to me.\n\nâThey see what Iâve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,â he said. âThey want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They donât want to have millions of people come and take their jobs. And we â thatâs whatâs happening. These people that are coming into our country are taking jobs away from African Americans and they know it.â\n\nI reminded him I was talking about millionaires, not working stiffs worried about immigrant labor. He conceded, jokingly, that Don King was not at risk of being replaced.\n\nTheir relationships came up more directly after my next question, when I asked how he responds to Black voters who call him racist.\n\nâI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldnât be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,â he told me. âThey would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist â and Iâm not racist!â\n\nWeâll find out in November if Trump wins this argument. He lost Black voters by a 92-8 margin in his last election, according to a Pew Research study , despite high hopes for a breakthrough that cycle. In 2016, he settled for boasting that fewer Black voters had showed up to the polls that year, which he said wasÂ âalmost as goodâ as their support.\n\nBut while he hasnât succeeded yet, Trump was getting at something noteworthy in our conversation. A common obstacle to outreach for Republican politicians is that theyâre often from cloistered, white spaces where they donât have many interactions with Black people. Thatâs not Trumpâs issue: Heâs had famous âBlack friends,â as they say, throughout his career, even as he was constantly dogged by accusations of racism at the same time. The people I spoke to werenât passing acquaintances, either. They had made deals together, weathered crises together, and shared family gatherings together. One had even chaperoned Don Jr. on a trip to Disney World.\n\nAnd while a handful of aging Reagan-era celebrities obviously arenât a stand-in for all Black people, and especially the rank-and-file voters who actually decide elections, they do represent a recognizable part of Black culture that Trump has long been plugged into. His success in the election may partly depend on whether, in this shifting cultural moment, there are enough Americans thinking about the election the way Mike Tyson does.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs aides seemed to think I might understand their candidate because I was shaped by the same New York era. I grew up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and 1990s at the nexus of these two Black Americas, where ordinary folks and celebrities meet. When I was in my early twenties, I worked at Dooney & Bourke in Trump Tower, selling leather handbags to tourists. I knew Tyson as a global icon, but also as the local bigshot who ran in the same circles as my childhood friendsâ older siblings.\n\nAnd so a couple of weeks after I pitched the campaign an interview, I was in Wildwood, New Jersey talking to Taylor and his old Giants teammate Ottis âOJâ Anderson at a Trump rally. Taylorâs case for Trump was one Iâd heard from voters many, many times before.\n\nâHeâs going to speak his mind,â he told me. âHe doesnât care how it comes out.â\n\nHe added, crucially: âHeâs a manâs man.â\n\nTaylor, like all of the names I had been put in touch with, had a business relationship with Trump at some point as well as a social one. He recalled meeting Trump when he tried to poach him as part of a failed football venture that briefly competed with the NFL. âHe put a million dollars in my account and said, listen, he wants me to play â and weâve been friends ever since,â he said.\n\nAt the time of that rally, Trump was still on trial in a Manhattan court over hush money payments to an adult film actress ahead of his first election; he faces three more pending criminal trials in state and federal courts. It was a problem his friends could relate to.\n\nTaylor, who was plagued by off-field issues throughout his Hall-of-Fame playing career, pleaded guilty in 2011 to patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute. (He said he believed she was 19). Trump stood by Tyson in the 1990s while he was jailed on a rape charge that he denied (he also was hosting his fights , which required the boxer to be out of jail). In 2016, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus reportedly intervened to keep King off the 2016 convention stage because of his prior manslaughter conviction.\n\nâThe party could not associate itself with someone convicted of a felony,â the New York Times noted at the time, which might as well have been a thousand years ago.\n\nStrawberry came out the other side of drug addiction and jail to become an evangelical preacher. When I spoke to him, he mentioned that he and other sports stars know what itâs like to face the burning gaze of the public, something he connected to support for Trump.\n\nâPeople are hoping that he comes back, a lot of athletes,â Strawberry said. âA lot of times people are afraid to say â theyâre afraid of public opinion, and Iâve had public opinion my whole lifeâ¦they were saying I couldnât survive, I couldnât make it. And guess what? Iâm still here.â\n\nTrumpâs gains with nonwhite voters in the polls have mostly come from younger Americans . When I mentioned to Trump during our interview that the people that Iâd been directed to talk to all seemed to be associated with a certain bygone period, he immediately thought to add another name to the list.\n\nâDid you give her Herschel?â he asked his staff.\n\nHe was referring to Herschel Walker, the former football star who lost his Senate race last cycle while facing political attacks over allegations of past domestic abuse and previously unacknowledged children. A born-again Christian, Walker told voters at the time that he had moved past a dark period of mental illness and was reformed.\n\nA few days later, I received a call from Walker, who adores Trump. He recalled how they became close in the 1980s, when he was also involved in Trumpâs football endeavors. Walker volunteered to take a young Don Jr. to Disney World with his own family while his team was at training camp in Orlando. The ease with which a white New York businessman befriended âa Black kid who came from this little town with absolutely nothing,â made a strong impression.\n\nâI know the man has got a great heart,â he said.\n\nWalker rejected the premise that Trump had a problem with Black voters âÂ he said he was sick of being asked to âdefendâ him as a Black man, as if supporting Trump required an extraordinary explanation. His advice to the campaign was to start showing up more often in Black neighborhoods and to treat voters the same as they would white voters.\n\nâWhat I told Don is I think you need to go see more Black people in the cities and talk to them,â he said. âI said, you know, they love you.â\n\nThereâs a reason I keep mentioning the shared legal problems of Trump and his friends: Itâs become inextricable from any discussion of his outreach to Black voters.\n\nBefore his Manhattan trial, Trump had taken to comparing his personal legal struggles to those Black men face in the criminal justice system. At one point in February, he boasted that âthe Black populationâ loved seeing his mugshot in Fulton County, Georgia where he faces separate criminal charges over election interference. He has repeatedly compared himself to Nelson Mandela, the late South African president who spent decades as a political prisoner while opposing apartheid.\n\nDemocrats have accused him of reinforcing ugly stereotypes for his personal benefit. When I asked him about the topic, he said it wouldnât be part of his pitch to Black voters â but also couldnât help making the comparison again.\n\nâNo, it wonât be part of my message,â Trump said. âI think itâs through osmosis. They see whatâs happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, theyâve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see whatâs happened to them.â\n\nBlack conservatives arenât always happy about this kind of talk either. Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist, said she broached the topic with Trump at a dinner he hosted with HBCU students on the night of our interview. âDonât put that out there that Black people like you because youâre a felon,â she told me she said to Trump. âThe Black people donât like you because youâre a felon. The Black people who like you like you because they feel like youâre experiencing the things that they have been complaining about for years, and now maybe you can shine a light on the cries that have been falling on deaf ears for all of this time.â\n\nIt might make some people cringe, but itâs easier to understand where Trump gets the impression this is a relatable message when youâre spending time with his famous friends.\n\nâIf I never saw Donald Trump and didnât know he was white, I would think that he was Black,â Tyson told me. âThe way they were treating him in the papers and in the press? Think about that, the way they treat him in court? Thatâs the way they did Black people.â\n\nKing once said Trump understood Black people ââbecause âno matter what you say or do, you are guilty as hell.â The same week we spoke, rapper 50 Cent said during a Capitol visit that Black men identify with Trump âbecause they got RICO charges,â a reference to the statute being used to prosecute Trump in Georgia.\n\nâLook at what happened to a lot of the people of color and right now the injustice that is happening with Donald,â Walker told me. âRight now, itâs almost just âÂ itâs almost similar to that.â\n\nOf course, the question looming over this and every prior Trump campaign has been whether a few wealthy entertainers and athletes are representative of voters writ large. Thatâs especially true when theyâve faced their own accusations in the public eye that might make them uniquely inclined towards defending Trump.\n\nThereâs at least some early evidence Trump has misread the room in this regard: A poll by Democratic firm Navigator Research found Black voters were the group most likely to think Trump was guilty in the Manhattan case, by a 76-15 margin. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn also noted that their own post-verdict polling showed President Biden shoring up support with younger, politically disengaged, nonwhite voters âÂ the exact group Trump is targeting.\n\nDemocrats have watched Trumpâs polling rise with a mix of shock, anger, and disbelief. He has a long history of remarks that were widely condemned as racist and feuded as president with Black lawmakers like civil rights icon John Lewis , whose district he blasted as âcrime-infestedâ and who he continued to grouse about after his death. Who, they ask, is buying this?\n\nâHeâs trying to lean into his identity, Donald Trumpâs identity, as a criminal, because heâs now a convicted felon,â Rep. Steven Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told me. âItâs not a policy agenda that improves the lives of anyone, much less Black Americans. And not only is it an insult, it is an affront to Black men and Black people and what it is we are fighting forâ\n\nHorsford, who has been holding a tour of Black barbershops in his Las Vegas-area district, described Trumpâs campaign as âa bunch of platitudes with no actual policy or commitment behind them.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has taken Trumpâs polling gains seriously, though. In high-profile campaign speeches, ads, and statements, theyâve tried to remind voters âÂ and especially younger voters âÂ of his history of inflammatory statements and accusations of discrimination .\n\nâDonald Trump has spent his life and political career disrespecting Black men every chance he gets: he entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder, denigrated George Floydâs memory, and launched his political career trying to undermine the first Black president as the architect of birtherism,â Senior Biden Spokesperson Sarafina Chitikatold Semafor.\n\nVoters in their twenties today were children when Trump was leading his false birther charge against Barack Obama, a lengthy public crusade to prove that the first Black president was secretly born in Kenya and that his Ivy League pedigree at Columbia and Harvard Law School was nothing more than affirmative action. He dropped the issue just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nI brought the topic up with Trump in passing; he responded only in generalities about his broader record on issues like HBCU funding. But even some of his friends were stung by that one. Tyson told me he âdidnât agreeâ with Trumpâs Obama-bashing at the time, though he added he didnât let it affect their relationship. Walker chalked it up as âpart of this politics thing.â\n\nDemocrats are also hoping to capture the energy of four years ago, when the nation was engaged in large-scale protests against police brutality and racial inequality, a movement that notably also had broad buy-in from Black athletes in the major sports leagues. Trump condemned the Black Lives Matter movement in his debates with Biden and staged a photo-op outside the White House after riot police tear-gassed Lafayette Square. More recently, he bragged in a Time interview about how he had threatened protestors who âdesecratedâ monuments with 10-year minimum sentences.\n\nThen thereâs the âCentral Park Five,â a group of teenagers who were arrested in 1989 and charged with the rape of a jogger, prompting Trump to take out an ad calling to reinstate the death penalty. They were later exonerated âÂ one recently became a New York City Council member âÂ but Trump has never acknowledged their innocence. Their story is featured in Bidenâs campaign ads .\n\nWhen I spoke to Tyson, he said the topic still comes up when he tries to sell fellow celebrities on Trump.\n\nâThe only thing they can say is that heâs a racist,â he said. âCentral Park Five, other than that, they canât bring up anything else. And most of those famous Black people, they werenât saying that when he was getting them free tickets at the fight and getting them free rooms at the fight âÂ they werenât saying he was a racist then.â\n\nThat Trump is generous to his friends is part of the Democratsâ message, too. Theyâre arguing the former presidentâs sudden interest in discrimination as a smokescreen: Itâs not that he wants a more just legal system, itâs that he wants to abuse the law in order to protect himself, reward his allies, and punish his enemies.\n\nâWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol?â Biden said at a Philadelphia event aimed at Black voters in May. âI donât think heâd be talking about pardons.â\n\nTrump has made tough talk on crime central to his campaign. But he also appealed to Black voters in 2020 by touting his work on the First Step Act, the most significant criminal justice reform package in years, and he boasted about granting clemency and pardons to some nonviolent drug offenders .\n\nThe politics of that movement have changed significantly since then. Following a crime surge in his final year in office, Trump began talking less about freeing prisoners on old drug charges, and more about executing drug dealers . A number of Trumpâs Republican primary challengers criticized the First Step Act and even suggested repealing it.\n\nSo I was at least somewhat surprised to hear Trump still sounded largely like it was 2020 when I raised these topics.\n\nâPeople have been treated very unfairly and itâs largely Black people,â he said. âItâs Hispanic people, itâs not just Black.â\n\nIn fact, he talked about expanding the First Step Act âÂ though itâs not clear how, and Trump has a history of promising policy rollouts that are always right around the corner.\n\nâWeâre going to be doing extensions of that,â he told me, adding that heâd release amendments for âstrengthening certain thingsâ while âworking on fairness.â\n\nIn some corners of the right, like Tucker Carlsonâs online show, thereâs been a renewed effort to defend Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota cop who killed George Floyd and is currently in jail for murder. Trump has pledged to âindemnify all police officers and law enforcement officialsâ if heâs re-elected, touching on a longstanding debate about whether police officers should be held personally responsible for their professional actions.\n\nHe has not elaborated on how broadly this policy should be applied, nor is it clear he has much ability to influence these cases at all. But he did tell me he believed Chauvin should not have been shielded from prosecution.\n\nâNo. What he did was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. That was crazy. When I looked at that â I watched that tape many times, no,â he said. âBut they have a lot of people that did a good job, and they were innocent. And you know, theyâve lost everything. Theyâve lost everything.â\n\nâSay hello to Don âÂ I love Don King,â Trump told me before we parted. âHeâs unbelievable. This guy was unique. There was never anybody like Don King.â\n\nAnd so after my visit to Mar-a-Lago, my nostalgia tour took me 45 miles south to Hollywood, Florida, where King was promoting his Fist of Fury boxing event.\n\nWhen I arrived for the weigh-in, King, 92 years old, was slumped in a wheelchair, though still strikingly tall. The light wasnât in his eyes like it used to be, but he could still pull off a look âÂ he was wearing one of his signature rhinestone denim jackets with an American flag design that heâs been photographed in many times before. With the assistance of his two grandsons, he was able to get on stage and stand just long enough to pose between boxers during their staredowns.\n\nKing wasnât in the mood to chat much, but his niece was there to help him get around. A self-described â Republicrat ,â he enthusiastically backed Trump in his prior campaigns and Jean King Battle told me her uncle has a lifesize cutout of Trump in their family room âbecause heâs family to my uncle.â When I approached him the next day, he seemed unaware we were scheduled to talk.\n\nBut Trump was right about one thing: The place had strong MAGA vibes and they were feeding off the testosterone in the room.\n\nâThatâs my nâa,â boxer Adrien Broner, 34, said when Trump was mentioned at the weigh-in. When I asked him to elaborate, he said, âTrumpâs the man. When Trump was in office, everybody was eating.â Dressed in a taxi-yellow sweatsuit with âWORK OR DIEâ on the back he added, âHeâs a man that means business. Just like me.â\n\nA promoter at the event, Egypt Brown, characterized Trumpâs allure in the boxing world as rooted in masculinity. âThey donât connect with Pride month as a fighter,â Brown told me. âThey donât connect with women fighting with men in their sport because itâs all about competition.â\n\nIâd heard similar things in Philadelphia just days earlier, when Republican Reps. Byron Donalds and Wesley Hunt hosted a â Congress, Cognac, and Cigars â gathering at a smoking lounge to discuss Black male politics. Democratsâ emphasis on LGBTQ issues was helping drive Black voters to Republicans, Donalds said, while an audience member complained to me that feminism was leaving Black men behind.\n\nâThey intentionally promote the Black woman so she can look down on the Black man,â said Michael Blackwell, 60. âSo not only is society looking down at us, now the Black woman is because she got a hundred thousand dollars, got a career. Sheâs been conditioned to not need a man.â\n\nMy 1980s road trip through Donald Trumpâs star-studded world may wind up being a sideshow âÂ just another journalistâs half-futile attempt to understand the direction of the American public. Or it may be a kind of early warning system of something deeper.\n\nLeaders across the political spectrum are scrambling to channel the shifting politics of gender and a sense that men, in particular, have become alienated from the political system. Republicans have long argued that Black voters are more socially conservative than their vote indicates; their hope is that making elections a referendum on traditional masculinity will find a receptive audience.\n\nA big question is whether Trump has an operation ready to capitalize on his polling: The Biden campaign pointed to the newly revamped RNCâs struggles to nail their own program, including an initial decision to close minority outreach centers.\n\nTrumpâs effort is still in its early stages and has been stymied by a lack of direction, with no dedicated lead for ethnic and faith-based outreach. The campaign tapped Gina Carr to focus on Black outreach around the time of his South Bronx rally last month, which was touted as a show of his dedication to reaching nonwhite voters. But itâs still not clear the level of resources or scheduling the campaign plans to roll out, or whether it might release a targeted policy platform for Black Americans like 2020âs â Platinum Plan .â Lynne Patton, his senior advisor, said in a statement that his âpledge to Black Americansâ would be to âreinstateâ his old policies on issues like the economy and immigration.\n\nBut no one should assume Black voters are permanently immune to the kinds of appeals that have worked for similarly positioned white voters âÂ that Trumpâs business success translates to success overseeing an economy, or that his personal problems equate to their personal problems, or that his distrust of the âdeep stateâ echoes their suspicions about government or media or corporations. Trump would hardly be the first candidate to try to beat an unpopular incumbent by feeding votersâ frustrations, avoiding policy specifics, and asking them to project their hopes on him.\n\nI asked Tyson about his interactions with ordinary people when it comes to Trump. He told me fans he meets are skeptical, but that his relationship with the former president makes them curious if theyâre missing something.\n\nâStreet people, they say âYo, I donât fâ with your man [Trump], but he loves you,ââ he said. âThey want to meet him. They ask me âwhat is he like?ââ\n\nAnd what does he tell them?\n\nâHeâs a people person,â he said. âThe common people voted him into office. It wasnât no big shot that voted him in office.â\n\nNot everyone buys the premise that Trumpâs gains with Black voters in polls will translate to the real world. While he has some concerns about younger voters, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher told me that about 14% of Black men have typically voted Republican in non-Obama cycles and heâs seen little in his own polling of likely voters âÂ and especially in recent election results â to indicate this will change in a major way.\n\nâ[There] is literally no evidence in actual voting that Black voters, including Black men, are somehow historically breaking Republican,â Belcher said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Harris caps Democratic conventionâs return to Obamaism\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Democratic Convention marked the triumphal return of former President Barack Obamaâs brand of politics âÂ with some notable updates for the Donald Trump era.\n\nIn this article:\n\nPut aside the questions of Obamaâs role as party leader and the running debates about his record. The most striking feature of this gathering, fittingly in his hometown Chicago, was all Obama style. Night after night, the DNC marked the return of a patriotic pluralism that speaks to America as a united country trying to do the right thing, even when its residents struggle to see themselves that way.\n\nObama portrayed himself in 2008 as a post-partisan opportunity to âcast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the pastâ and move past the psychodramas of the Bush and Clinton era. Kamala Harris framed her potential election as a chance to end an exhausting decade defined by Trump, both in and out of office. She lingered on the promise to be a president âfor all Americans.â\n\nâOur nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past â a chance to chart a new way forward,â said Harris. âNot as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.â\n\nThe Obamas themselves used their speeches to position Harris as the heir to their hopeful brand of politics, but she was already cribbing heavily from that era of Democratic messaging, eliciting âUSA!â chants along the way, even as she brought a harder edge to her attacks.\n\nThe selection of Tim Walz helps to crystallize the message, which celebrates the countryâs diversity with a deliberately naive âAinât that America for ya!â kind of wonder. Onstage with her new running mate earlier this month, Harris marveled at how âonly in Americaâ could two âmiddle-class kids,â one a âdaughter of Oaklandâ and another âa son of the Nebraska plains,â come together and âmake it all the way to the White House.â In her convention speech, she said she was âno stranger to unlikely journeysâ as she recounted her upbringing as the child of immigrants.\n\nThis kind of rah-rah liberalism via biography is an echo of Obamaâs own signature speech from the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The former president himself caught the connection, using his latest address to link Harris to his success as âkids with funny names who believe in a country where anything is possible,â a direct reference to his speech two decades earlier. And, to paraphrase another Obama line from 2004, Walzâs speech was about how Americans coach high school football in the blue states and donât like politicians poking around their libraries in the red states.\n\nThe old time religion clearly delighted Democrats in Chicago and raised the question of why it had been less prominent in recent years. The answer lies in two trends that fed each other over the past decade.\n\nOne was Trumpâs racist birther campaign and inflammatory 2016 run, an exacting kind of anti-Obamaism that made hopes of an enlightened future in which old prejudices disappear into the melting pot look ridiculous. Obamaâs take on the electoral process as a good faith disagreement between people with shared values â still the core of his Tuesday speech â also became a much harder sell amid Trumpâs in-your-face politics. Democrats struggled to see that red-hatted friend, relative, or neighbor as a fellow American with different views rather than, at best, complicit in a toxic conspiracy to dismantle their countryâs most cherished institutions.\n\nSecond was the rise of new social justice movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, which accelerated during Trumpâs presidency and peaked in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Disillusioned with the pace of social and economic gains after Obamaâs election and the backlash of the Trump presidency, Democrats of all races looked for answers as to what went wrong. New voices, often steeped in scholarship, offered a credible explanation: America was plagued by overlapping systems of oppression that needed to be identified and dismantled.\n\nObamaâs celebration of gradual progress, and his Hamilton-style reworking of history around it, sounded naive in that context and his universal rhetoric sounded evasive. Democrats moved toward more direct appeals to marginalized groups, often borrowing terms from academia, and made more ambitious and targeted promises to help them.\n\nThese trends have changed the party permanently âÂ as Harris said in a different context, âWeâre not going backâ âÂ but they also ran into limits that have made Obamaism look more attractive now than it was four years earlier.\n\nTrump no longer looks like an âaberration,â as President Joe Biden hoped he would be, but a lasting force who remade his entire party in ways that will likely extend past his lifetime. That makes the quest to defeat him even more urgent for Democrats, but it also means making peace with the idea that your Fox News uncle isnât going anywhere.\n\nAs Obama put it, âif a parent or grandparent occasionally says something that makes us cringe, we donât automatically assume theyâre bad people.â Acknowledging this, he said, was the way to âbuild a true Democratic majority.â He made a near-identical point in his famous Philadelphia race speech in 2008, even citing his own beloved grandmotherâs prejudices.\n\nPolitically, Democrats looked at the polls and decided that the more academic vocabulary and policy thinking around race and gender was sometimes alienating to the groups it was meant to appeal to. Black voters decisively chose Biden as the partyâs standard bearer in 2020 over more bleeding-edge progressive rivals; Trumpâs recent gains have largely come with nonwhite voters and Gen Z no longer looks like a left-wing majority in waiting. The tough-on-crime, tough-on-border politics Harris ran away from in 2019 are increasingly common in deep blue cities.\n\nObamaism has subsequently become more popular as a way to speak to the broadest group of voters possible in plainer language without qualification or apology, even as the party is still comfortably further left on policy than it was in 2008.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example of the shift came from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had one of the best-received speeches of the week with a populist stemwinder positioning Democrats as the party of the working class and Trump as the champion of billionaires. Like Obama, she relied on her biography (a New York bartender), to make a charismatic appeal to the largest possible group (anyone with a job) in order to reject âa cynical politics that seemed blind to the realities of working peopleâ (a very Obama 2008 idea).\n\nCompare that, as The Atlanticâs Yair Rosenberg did , to her brief 2020 DNC remarks, in which she asked America to ârecognize and repair the wounds of racial injustice, colonization, misogyny, and homophobia, and to propose and build reimagined systems of immigration and foreign policy that turn away from the violence and xenophobia of our pastâ and you can see the quantum leap of the last four years.\n\nNot everything about the new Obamaism is the same. The biggest tweak for the ugly 2020s is a partywide departure from the former presidentâs above-it-all civility â Obama himself used his hands to illustrate Trumpâs âweird obsession with crowd sizesâ (hint hint), the kind of once-shocking line that few commentators can even pretend to be offended by post-Trump. And Harris was absolutely relentless in condemning the âunserious manâ she faced with the zeal of an actual prosecutor.\n\nThere are still targeted messages to different groups of voters, of course. Michelle Obama bluntly noted in her speech Trump and his âugly, misogynistic, racist liesâ have not gone away. But the language around the platform has largely been wrapped in Obamaesque appeals to American traditions. The biggest theme of the convention has been âfreedom,â a simple umbrella term that can be adjusted toward everyone from social justice warriors to mind-your-business libertarians.\n\nAt the grassroots level, where the excitement (and fundraising) is truly only comparable to the Obama campaign, thereâs also been a noticeable shift. The overnight rise of groups like â White Dudes for Harris â alongside Walzâs camo hat liberalism represent a kind of synthesis of 2008 and 2024 politics: Progressives who acknowledge discrimination, but can also laugh about cultural differences rather than constantly look to deconstruct them.\n\nWhen I look at this new Obamaism, I think of a video the Harris campaign released in which Harris and Walz casually get to know each other. Walz went viral joking about his spiceless âwhite guy tacosâ; Harris topped him by asking if they included âmayonnaise and tuna.â The two traded music tastes: Walz went through the all-time White Dad Classics like Bob Seger; Harris named jazz, soul, and hip hop artists and contrasted herself with Doug Emhoffâs interest in Depeche Mode, a stereotypical favorite of the white college-educated hipsters of his day. Their âVenn diagramâ was Prince, of course, who encompassed all these genres while also being the hometown hero of Walzâs Minnesota.\n\nTo quote an ancient pop song, weâre a little bit country, weâre a little bit rock and roll. Does that sound like a pretty banal observation? Congratulations, youâre doing it right.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "What a Kamala Harris presidency might look like\n\nInsights from Politico, The New York Times, Semafor, and New York\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris is the frontrunner to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in November â the choice not just of Biden and a host of senior Democrat leaders but also the politician who polled highest as a Biden replacement before yesterdayâs announcement.\n\nHer nomination isnât certain yet, but as her support coalesces, the focus is shifting to what a potential Harris administration could mean for the US. Based on her record as Californiaâs attorney general, as senator, as a presidential candidate, and as vice president, sheâs known for being a staunch supporter of abortion rights, having ambitious climate goals, and for her sympathy to the Palestinian cause.\n\nHarris is a bigger proponent of action on the environment than Biden, Bloomberg noted: She proposed a $10 trillion climate deal and backed the Green New Deal when she ran as a candidate in 2020, and vowed to ban fracking. She has also become a key voice in the abortion rights movement âÂ a strong voter issue for the Democrats nationally. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, she also introduced laws to ban police chokeholds and no-knock warrants, reform qualified immunity, and establish a national standard for use of force. But as an attorney general, she also supported Californiaâs death penalty, which drew criticism from progressives, Semaforâs Morgan Chalfant noted. Sheâs also been a vocal supporter of student debt relief.\n\nOn foreign policy , Harris would likely support Ukraine, deepen relations in Asia to counter China, and support Israel, Politico noted. But sheâs also been outspoken in calling out the violence in Gaza, which could attract voters that took issue with Bidenâs staunchly pro-Israel stance. On trade, Harris was previously against two major deals Biden supported, including the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which she said would not do enough to preserve the environment and American jobs. Meanwhile on immigration, a top voter issue, sheâs drawn criticism from the right â she was tasked with addressing the âroot causesâ of migration to the US by Biden, and the GOP has blamed her for the number of border crossings and taken to calling her Bidenâs âborder czar.â\n\nVice presidents tend to have good odds to succeed in elections, New York magazine noted. Perhaps more importantly, she is â a late substitution for an unpopular Democratic president facing an unpopular former Republican president ,â so she could offer a fresh contrast to both Biden and Trump, it added. An average of 11 polls compiled by The Washington Post shows that thereâs little difference between how Biden and Harris stack up against Trump â the former president still has a lead of about 1.5 points over Harris. That could change now: Harrisâ nomination would be historic âÂ she would be the first woman of color, as well as the first from a western state, if she were nominated âÂ and that could energize voters as they wake up to this new reality.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Media\n\nWelcome to Semafor Media, where weâd intended to take this week off but couldnât stop the scoops coming.\n\nProduction cycles in the film and TV business are slow â months at least, often years. And that can be a problem when society changes fast. Maxâs story below marks a real sign of the times: A major anti-racist project commissioned by Netflix in 2020 was quietly killed as the winds changed. I suspect there are many more like that we havenât heard of.\n\nAlso today: One big reason that CNN staffersâ Jeff Zucker fantasies wonât come true, and the Vice aftermath continues.\n\nIf youâre feeling patriotic, sign up with one-click for Semafor Americana, Dave Weigelâs consistently-a-month-ahead twice-weekly look at American politics.\n\nBristol : ESPN fires a bunch of big names , girding for a streaming future. â New York Post\n\nParis: A right-leaning French tycoon is extending his influence over media. â FT\n\nDublin : The Irish national broadcaster RTÃ is engulfed in a scandal around secret payments to its star host Ryan Tubridy. The sums, it should be admitted, might not persuade an American TV star to get out of bed. â BBC\n\nTHE SCOOP\n\nAmid the turmoil after George Floydâs murder by police in 2020, Netflix sought to address racist depictions in its film and television library in its own, particularly on-brand way.\n\nSome entertainment companies, like Amazon, had added disclaimers before television shows like Mad Men and movies including Borat. Others, like NBC Universal, removed episodes of television shows that included blackface.\n\nNetflix, by contrast, sought to expand its successful nonfiction series âExplained,â produced by Vox Media, into that sensitive space.\n\nIn early 2021, the company contracted with Vox to create a series of videos that would run alongside movies or television shows featuring racist or stereotypical caricatures. The videos would explain topics like the use of blackface and âyellowfaceâ in Hollywood, as well as the depiction of native Americans in classic films and westerns.\n\nThe task fell to Vox Creative, a brand studio within the media company that aims to âinfluence audiences from a position of truth and purpose, and to build a more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming brand experience,â according to its website.\n\nMore than two dozen Vox staffers and post-production contractors worked on the videos, which were regularly shared with Netflix executives for notes and feedback, according to two people who worked on the project.\n\nBut as the political climate cooled â and corporate racial justice initiatives faced a growing backlash from the right â the project lost steam. First, Netflix told producers that the short videos should be pieced together into a lengthier explainer on race on screen.\n\nEarlier this year, Netflix killed the project.\n\nMAXâS VIEW\n\nNetflix did not explain its decision to kill the project to the people who worked on it, and didnât respond to an inquiry from Semafor.\n\nBut the decision represents the latest retreat by a major brand away from the social justice messaging many companies adopted in the wake of Floydâs death in 2020.\n\nOver the past several months, a number of prominent companies have caved to backlash from conservative groups around LGBTQ messaging. Anheuser-Busch cut ties with trans model Dylan Mulvaney, and put the marketing executives responsible for bringing her on as a spokesperson for Bud Light on leave following massive anti-trans backlash. Target pulled items from its Pride line following complaints from the right.\n\nAdvertising and marketing executives have conceded that there have been consequences for brands from highlighting issues like race, sexuality, and gender identity. Last summer chief brand officer at Procter and Gamble Marc Pritchard told an audience at Cannes Lions that advertising had âgone too far into the goodâ at expense of commercial goals. This year, Semafor reported that organizers of the advertising industryâs top awards ceremony quietly advised jurors to steer clear of granting awards based solely on politics and advocacy in favor of focusing on more commercially-minded campaigns.\n\nAnd while many large, mainstream brands are loath to admit that theyâre responding to social pressures, staffing reflects shifting priorities. Quietly, a number of companies have laid off, fired, or seen executives leave who were brought in to address diversity, equity, and inclusion. Just last week, Netflix announced that its head of inclusion strategy was stepping down in September, while Warner Bros. Discovery said it was laying off diversity executive Karen Horne on Friday amid restructuring.\n\nFor Room for Disagreement, read here.\n\nJon Meacham is a former Newsweek editor, historian and occasional adviser to President Biden, who said last week heâs heard from journalists that âthereâs no editors any more.â\n\nOne big thing in cable news â¦ Thereâs a certain logic to the debt-ridden WBD selling CNN, and to Jeff Zucker and his friends â or some other investor â buying it. The problem: Zuckerâs money comes largely from the United Arab Emirates. The Saudis and Qataris also quietly make up much of the cash available to big deals like this.\n\nBut a foreign-backed bid for CNN could trigger âthe mother of all CFIUS reviews,â said Ivan Schlager of Kirkland & Ellis, a leading expert on the foreign influence regulation. He noted that even the sale of Forbes to Indian investors has been held up by political concerns. If the investment is more than 25%, and if the foreign parent arenât truly passive limited partners (neither the case in Zuckerâs Redbird IMI), Schlager predicted that competitors and members of Congress could block the deal on concerns of creating âanother Al Jazeera.â\n\nOne big thing in bankruptcyâ¦ Just weeks before Vice declared bankruptcy in May, the millennial media company paid performance bonuses to top-level executives.\n\nThe bonuses were part of the annual payouts executives at the company received based on performance in the previous year, according to two people with direct knowledge of the stipends. But the checks were written as the company was gearing up for potential bankruptcy â which means many rank and file staffers and freelancers werenât paid for work from April and May, and were furious to learn of the bossesâ bonuses.\n\nThe company has continued to cut costs in other areas, including eliminating the messaging app Slack. On Thursday, an HR rep sent an email to staff saying that the company will not be able to pay severance this month.\n\nA spokesperson for Vice declined to comment, but the company has previously maintained that despite delays, it intends to pay staff and freelancers for work completed before the bankruptcy.\n\nIn podcastingâ¦. The BBC is looking for a new head of audio to grow the organizationâs commercial podcast business and help the British media giant expand into the USâ¦Former Reply All host PJ Vogtâs new podcast Search Engine is expected to drop on July 7.\n\nIn news partnerships â¦Uber whistleblower Susan Fowler Rigetti is taking over as editor of Future Tense, the tech publication run by Slate, Arizona State University, and the New America foundation.\n\nâ Max\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "A struggling Jamaal Bowman hopes to stave off a devastating loss for the left\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, NY â On Friday afternoon, before he brought Bernie Sanders onstage at a riverside rally, Rep. Jamaal Bowman introduced the crowd to Mayor Nicola Armacost.\n\nâWhen I got into office, she opened this municipality to me,â said Bowman. âWhatâs this, a village? A village! She opened this village to me.â He praised her courage, her experience, and her willingness to stand up to his challenger, Westchester County executive George Latimer.\n\nâAnd thatâs it,â Bowman said. âWe ainât got no more local endorsements.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nElected in 2020 after ousting a longtime Democratic incumbent with a surge of progressive votes , Bowman is heading into Election Day on Tuesday as an out-spent underdog.\n\nJust four years ago, he was part of a successful progressive strategy, kicked off by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her nearby Bronx district, to vault the left into greater political relevance. With the help of groups like Justice Democrats, activists targeted safe blue seats held by longtime moderates and recruited allied candidates to build a growing âSquadâ in Congress. Momentum was on their side.\n\nThis year, the same movement is playing defense instead and Bowmanâs race is seen as a potential turning point. The congressman and his allies describe his race as a test of whether the most expensive House primary in history â more than $21 million on Latimerâs behalf, $14.5 million of it from the pro-Israel group AIPACâs super PAC â can break what the left spent years building.\n\nâIt is one of the most significant elections in the modern history of this country,â said Sanders. âThis election is about whether billionaire super PACs can buy our democracy.â\n\nIf Bowman wins this primary, heâll have overcome nonstop negative ads, abandonment by some former supporters, and a turnout effort thatâs driven out votes in Latimerâs best areas. If he loses â as no member of the extended Squad ever has â the progressive effort to humble AIPAC, which theyâve tried to define as a pro-Republican front group, will absorb a massive defeat.\n\nNo Democrat has made that argument as consistently and passionately as Bowman. According to him , Latimer is both an âanti-Black racistâ and an âanti-Muslim racist.â The evidence: His tongue-tied comments about the âethnicâ advantage Bowman has with Black voters, and his comment that Bowmanâs âconstituency is Dearborn, Mich.,â not Westchester County. (Latimer has since explained that he was talking about Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American who represents Dearborn, raising money for Bowman.)\n\nâIâm an outspoken Black man,â Bowman said at the close of his final debate with Latimer, explaining why AIPAC had targeted him. âI fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here.â When I asked Bowman what heâd say to AIPAC if he won his race, a question I asked AIPAC target Dave Min a few months ago, Bowman said he wouldnât call the group at all.\n\nâI think the win will speak for itself,â said Bowman. âI think what we have to do is double down and continue to organize the grassroots, and labor, and the American people, to save and preserve our democracy.â\n\nThat worked in April, when Pennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee fended off a challenger who criticized her support for a ceasefire and accused her of being an anti-Biden chaos agent. AIPAC stayed out of that race, surmising that Lee couldnât lose; Lee made moves to keep them out, backing out of an appearance at a Muslim event after learning that one speaker made positive comments about Oct. 7.\n\nPro-Israel groups focused on this race instead. Bowman spent most of it on his back heel, buffeted by negative stories that no one had written in 2020, and abandoned by some endorsers, like the progressive pro-Israel group J Street, over his louder criticism of Israel. He told Democratic Socialists of America that he now supported the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, reversing his 2020 position; he accused Latimer of supporting âgenocide,â and called AIPAC a âZionist regime.â\n\nThe strategists at participating PACs are confident that theyâll beat Bowman, whose grasp on the 16th Congressional District was shaky before a dollar was spent this year. Two years ago, as an incumbent seeking his first re-election, Bowman won just 54% of the primary vote â a landslide in the small Bronx portion of the seat, and a weak performance in Westchester.\n\nâThe hatred against the congressman was just phenomenal,â said Brook Packard, a local who canvassed for Bowman that year in Rye, where Latimer lives. âPeople slammed the door in our face. They said they were disgusted with him and the Squad. It wasnât so much that they loved his opponents. They were anti-Bowman.â\n\nOver the next year, the anti-Bowman resistance mobilized. After Hamasâs attack on Israel, the congressman called for an immediate ceasefire and accused the country of peddling âpropaganda,â telling a crowd that âthereâs still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped womenâ â comments heâd retract months later as reports of sexual violence continued to emerge . Days before the 10/7 attack against Israel, Bowman was caught on camera pulling a House office fire alarm, which he called a mistake, generating what-was-he-thinking coverage back home that had nothing to do with Israel. He later pleaded guilty to a related charge and was censured on the House floor.\n\nIn January, shortly after Latimer entered the race, the county executiveâs own polling showed him 10 points ahead of Bowman. Armacost, the mayor of a small, progressive village, stuck by Bowman; the mayor of Yonkers, Bowmanâs home and the districtâs biggest city, went for Latimer.\n\nâAIPAC found a candidate that was willing to be bought,â said Ana MarÃ­a Archila, the co-director of New Yorkâs Working Families Party, which has organized for Bowman in every race. âThey havenât been able to do that in other places.â\n\nSince 2018, when veterans of Bernie Sandersâs first presidential bid began running progressive candidates in deep blue districts, theyâd elected nine of them, from Rep. Ayanna Pressley in Boston to Rep. Greg Casar in Austin. In each race, the goal was to find a âcompelling young leader that reflects the community,â as Justice Democrats co-founder Alexandra Rojas explained in 2019, replacing âan older career establishment politician that does not reflect the true diversity of that district.â\n\nBowman, a Black high school principal whoâd never sought office before, epitomized what JD wanted. In 2020, he defeated Rep. Eliot Engel by 15 points, capitalizing on an awkward incident when the elderly congressman, who had hunkered down in his Maryland residence during COVID, pleaded for speaking time at a New York Black Lives Matter rally. âIf I didnât have a primary,â he explained, âI wouldnât care.â\n\nLatimer presented a different challenge â a well-liked name brand, with an electoral career in the district that he started when the 46-year old Bowman was in elementary school. Pro-Bowman media amplified his argument, that the county executive was a secret racist tasked with eliminating a Black member of Congress.\n\nâHe says Iâve taken money from Hamas,â Bowman told me. âHeâs made outlandish comments about Emmett Till and Governor Cuomo. Heâs taking money from a PAC which targets 85% people of color.â\n\nIn the raceâs closing days, Bowman has honed that argument, asking if Westchester County really wants to oust its first Black congressman. On Saturday, when Sanders and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez rallied for Bowman in the Bronx, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said that the congressmanâs enemies kept âputting this caricature on him, of an angry Black man.â\n\nWhen he took the stage, Bowman rapped the first four bars of Wu Tang Clanâs âTriumph,â rolled up his shirtsleeves (âlet me get the guns outâ), hoisted a three-legged stool in the air, and called himself âthe hip-hop congressmanâ who AIPAC was âscared to deathâ of.\n\nâWeâre gonna show fucking AIPAC the motherfucking power of the South Bronx,â said Bowman; the South Bronx is not in his district, but buses were ready to take volunteers north when it was over. âPeople ask me, why I got a foul mouth? What am I supposed to do? You cominâ after me. You cominâ after my family. You cominâ after my children. Iâm not supposed to fight back?â\n\nThe bulk of the progressive movement, including Jewish Voices for Peace and organizations built by Sanders campaign veterans, is behind Bowman. They share his view that the race is an existential test of whether big money can remove their allies from Congress.\n\nâDemocrats always talk about how we donât like Citizens United,â Sanders told Semafor. âI requested over a year ago, to Democratic leadership: Keep Super PACs out of Democratic primaries. That, they could have done.â\n\nAt the Bronx rally, where hundreds of progressives rallied under ruthless heat â two attendees fainted â Bowman volunteers worried that any victory for AIPAC would be seen as a warning to Democrats, that they could not criticize Israel and keep their seats.\n\nâI am really worried about the far right and about the normalization of genocidal rhetoric in America,â said Genevieve Rand, a 27-year old trans woman who had taken a five-hour bus ride from Ithaca to canvass for Bowman. âThis is the front line of that fight in this country right now.â\n\nOthers disagree. In 2020, at the height of what progressives called the George Floyd uprising, the left was united behind Bowman. This year, in addition to losing J Street, the Bronx rally was protested by drum-banging members of pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime, who chanted that Bowman, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez were supporting âgenocideâ by supporting Joe Biden.\n\nâRep. Bowmanâs scurrilous and shameful attacks wonât hide his record of aligning with the extremist, anti-Israel fringe,â said AIPAC spokesman Marshall Wittman. âIn contrast to his opponent, George Latimer is a pro-Israel progressive who stands with the Jewish state as it battles Iranian terrorist proxies.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Two killings of Black homeless men highlight Democratsâ post-2020 divide\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe young Marine veteran who killed Jordan Neely will be charged with second-degree manslaughter today, nearly two weeks after putting the homeless subway performer who was reportedly shouting on a train in a deadly chokehold.\n\nA few days earlier, San Francisco supervisors urged the cityâs district attorney to release video evidence in the killing of Banko Brown, a homeless man shot by a security guard while allegedly shoplifting from a Walgreens.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe response to both killings, from Democrats leading overwhelmingly Democratic cities, was conflicted â and a study in how the party changed in the three years since the murder of George Floyd inspired a massive protest movement for criminal justice reform.\n\nâTwo things can be true,â said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco. âPeople are definitely frustrated with property crime and some of the conditions on our streets. And people donât want to see other people get shot.â\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, whose initial reaction to Neelyâs killing infuriated progressive activists by not condemning his killer, used a speech on Thursday to repeat that mentally ill people who posed a danger to themselves should be involuntarily confined, a position opposed by the New York Civil Liberties Union.\n\nâIf physiciansâ¦ find that the person has a mental illness, and is dangerous to themselves or others, they have the authority to admit that person and retain them for treatment, even if the person does not agree to it,â Adams said from city hall.\n\nThat response, said the NYCLU, âonly fuels stigma against homeless New Yorkers and those living with mental illness.â\n\nIn San Francisco, activists and left-leaning Democrats have condemned DA Brooke Jenkins for her handling of the Brown case â the killing of a Black trans man who had tried and failed to get supportive housing.\n\nJenkins, appointed by Mayor London Breed after voters recalled reform DA Chesa Boudin, initially said that the security guard who shot Brown âbelieved he was in mortal danger and acted in self-defense.â Brownâs advocates say those words could matter even if a case is eventually brought against the guard, possibly prejudicing a jury.\n\nâYou can be a defense attorney with one brain cell, and you can blow up that statement from the district attorney,â supervisor Dean Preston said at the boardâs public meeting this week, before the vote to urge the videoâs release.\n\nAdams and Jenkins were put in office by Democratic voters frustrated about crime and worried that liberal reformers were making it worse â Adams in a crowded mayoral primary, Jenkins after the Boudin recall. (She won re-election in her own right last November.) Adams defeated a more left-leaning field while talking about a return to police tactics that civil libertarians had sued over; Jenkins won after saying that her city was tired of being âmade fun of in the news across the country, because of the crime situation.â\n\nConservatives drove that backlash, too, and right wing media has been all over the Neely story, with many commentators noting the dozens of times he had been arrested. Some have portrayed his attacker, Daniel Penny, as a hero âÂ much like the vigilante Bernard Goetz , who became a polarizing household name after he shot four Black teenagers on a subway in 1984.\n\nBut theyâve also been a little slow to see that the movement that filled the streets in 2020 and that Republicans still criticize daily has lost ground and numbers, as elected Democrats got more nervous about rising crime rates and collapsing ridership on public transit. The protests over Neelyâs killing and Brownâs killing have been small, relative to what cities saw after prior high-profile deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police or civilians.\n\nReform advocates noticed the conflicted response by Democrats who embraced them three years ago. The Young Womenâs Freedom Center, where Brown worked to help at-risk women and trans people, called for âthe defunding of the police and juvenile carceral systemâ after he was killed, along with an end to âcontracting of armed securityâ and the âfalse narrativeâ that was justifying the cityâs police spending.\n\nIn an interview, the groupâs co-executive director Julia Arroyo said that young people were being victimized by media-driven panic about shoplifting: âEverythingâs behind glass, youâre constantly followed.â And at a rally, Arroyo said that the city was âkidnapping us and they are locking us up in jails and institutions.â\n\nWhile much of the political conversation around Neely has focused on why he had not been either jailed or reached by social services earlier, the picture of what went wrong is murkier. He had been listed as a priority by city agencies, referred to a psychiatric hospital in the past, and even been forced into a treatment facility as part of an assault charge â there was a warrant out for his arrest after he fled the institution.\n\nSteve Berg, the chief policy officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said that enforcement or treatment approaches would fall short without a path to transitional housing âÂ something that cities have often struggled to do, in part because of local opposition to new facilities or programs.\n\nâThe solution is largely to get people housed, so theyâre not homeless, and to make treatment available on an immediate basis for anyone who wants it,â said Berg. âMost people do want it. But mental health treatment is not going to be effective for people who are living on the streets instead of permanent housing. Thatâs just the reality. Thereâs lots of research to back that up.â\n\nHe added that some elected officials were creating a âvery dangerous situation,â when they suggested that the killing of some homeless people might be justified.\n\nHomelessness has been an issue in the 2024 Republican primary, where candidates have cited it as proof of Democratic policy failures. Donald Trump has proposed banning âurban camping,â arresting violators, and giving them the option of treatment or prison. âThe homeless have no right to turn every park and sidewalk into a place for them to squat and do drugs,â he said in a video last month. âAmericans should not have to step over piles of needles and waste.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Republicans had a rough night on Tuesday. Does that spell trouble for Ron DeSantis?\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn Jacksonville, the GOPâs candidate for mayor warned that Democrat Donna Deegan would start âdefunding the policeâ and âplacing radical activists in chargeâ of law enforcement. In Colorado Springs, Republican Wayne Williams claimed that his opponent would ruin the city with âsocialism.â And in Kentucky, Kelly Craft ran for governor on promises to execute drug dealers and âdismantleâ the state Department of Education.\n\nDeegan won, Williams lost, and Craft slumped into third place in Tuesdayâs GOP primary. In each race, tactics that paid off for Republicans in 2021 didnât have the same impact. Donald Trump immediately branded them as defeats for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, declaring his âmagic is gone,â after endorsing both Craft and defeated Jacksonville mayoral candidate Daniel Davis.\n\nFor once, Democrats agreed with Trump. In Jacksonville, where Davis out-spent Deegan better than 3-1, their candidate â a popular former TV anchor and the head of a breast cancer foundation â promised to âput more [police] officers on the streetsâ and reminded voters that crime had surged under Republican Mayor Lenny Curry. Davis, they said, ran too far to the right in a city Trump lost twice, and helped other Democrats win down-ballot.\n\nâWe just finished one of the most controversial legislative sessions in Tallahassee,â said Nikki Fried, the new chair of the success-starved Florida Democratic Party. âThat was fresh in peopleâs minds. It all backfired on them, and gave permission for Republicans and independents to cross over, to support Democrats.â\n\nThe GOP loss in Colorado Springs was more complicated: Mayor-elect Yemi Mobolade ran as an independent entrepreneur, not a Democrat. But like Deegan, he picked up some Republican endorsements and prevailed against a campaign that tried to drive up conservative turnout with warnings about crime and racial âequity.â\n\nAdd it all up and the picture looked concerning for Republicans looking to move on from Trump, but build off his culture war appeal. The default message Republicans had settled on in his absence âÂ much of it embodied by DeSantis and his âwar on woke,â and some of it delivered by consultants integral to his own expected run â again failed to win converts this week. That could spell trouble for a general election, but also for DeSantisâ electability argument in a primary against Trump.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs never ending search for an angle to use against his opponents helped make Tuesday about DeSantis in the press. Thatâs a little too easy.\n\nFloridaâs governor endorsed Craft with full knowledge of the public polling, as a favor to two friends who happen to be deep-pocketed donors, according to a person familiar with the decision. And Davis lost in Jacksonville with the strategic advice of Susie Wiles, a senior Trump advisor ever since DeSantis exiled her. A victory would have been spun as a Trump-aligned rescue mission; defeat, predictably, was blamed on the governor whoâs about to run against him.\n\nRepublicans in Kentucky also credited Craftâs defeat to a few different factors that may be less applicable to DeSantis. Attorney Gen. Daniel Cameron was popular in his own right, earning what GOP strategist Scott Jennings called âa deep and abiding affectionâ from conservatives for refusing to charge police officers in the killing of an unarmed Black woman, Breonna Taylor, in a no-knock raid on her apartment, then facing protests outside his private home.\n\nCameron had Trumpâs endorsement, a particular problem for Craft, whoâd worked in the administration. But he was also closely associated with Mitch McConnell, the dominant power broker in the state and the type of institutional Republican who DeSantis is counting on to help back a run against Trump. There were also candidate issues: Craft dodged public forums to the extent that even a promising Fox News interview foundered on questions about why she wouldnât face Cameron in person.\n\nHer paid messaging, much of it developed by Axiom Strategies, the firm behind the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down PAC, couldnât fix that. A super PAC ad hit Cameron for once supporting cashless bail , while her own campaign warned that the attorney general wouldnât take on the woke left like she would.\n\nâKelly Craftâs consultants let her down,â said T. J. Litafik, an unaffiliated Kentucky GOP strategist. âIt ended up looking contrived, and her messaging was uneven. For all that money, she deserved a better campaign.â\n\nStill, the less complicated, less personalized lesson from Tuesday was that some popular post-Trump GOP messaging may not be as effective as it was in 2021, or even last year.\n\nThe Florida GOP, with more resources and a better turnout operation, made the Jacksonville race close, but Davis lost because Democrats persuaded more non-affiliated and Republican voters to cross over. The relentless GOP effort to label her support for Black Lives Matter as a defund-the-police code felt labored and stale, especially in a GOP-run city where violent crime was out-pacing New York on a per capita basis. Democrats around the country are growing more confident, post-midterms, that they can rebut these appeals with ads showcasing support from sheriffs and police chiefs and clear candidate promises to boost police resources.\n\nâI believe it is both possible and necessary to support our law enforcement while demanding racial justice,â Deegan told Semafor. âEveryone was horrified by the murder of George Floyd, and I marched in BLM protests alongside other community leaders, like Mayor Lenny Curry, and our Sheriff to show solidarity for the innocent lives that are lost every day due to racial violence.â\n\nKentucky was another story â an all-GOP electorate and a front-runner whose conservative credentials were never effectively challenged. Craft wasnât the first wealthy candidate to pay consultants for a populist can-she-really-say-that campaign and then lose to a conservative who voters trusted more. But voters arenât as reactive to this message this time.\n\nRepublicans did pick up the mayoralty of Panama City on Tuesday, and argued that Democrats had ideal conditions for a win in Jacksonville that may not be present elsewhere. Speaking with Politico , FLGOP chairman Christian Ziegler bemoaned the partyâs âhuge bloody primaryâ in the mayoral race âwhere millions of dollars were spent to rip apart the eventual Republican nominee.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Keith Ellison got justice for George Floyd. Hereâs what he learned along the way.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nâItâs hard to convict the police,â Minnesota Attorney Gen. Keith EllisonÂ said Â in 2020. Heâd just taken over the investigation into the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, not long after arsonists had just burned down the cityâs third police precinct. Ellisonâs team won the case, and his new book, âBreak the Wheel,â recounts how they did it, as well as how he won a tight re-election campaign amid the backlash to 2020âs police reforms. This is an edited transcript of his conversation with Americana.\n\nAmericana: You get into your re-election last year in the book, and write that âI simply could not allow the lesson to be that prosecuting a cop is political suicide.â What would have happened, had you lost?\n\nKeith Ellison: I was worried that we would be further away from the basic idea of equal protection, the idea that nobody is above the law, nobodyâs beneath the law. Keith Ellison could go and do other things. Iâve never fully identified with the elective office that I happen to be holding at the time. But I felt a tremendous urgency to pull it out in that election, because if I lost, it would scare anybody away from doing what I believe is their duty as a prosecutor.\n\nThat would have been a horrible outcome. So I knocked every door I could. Can you prosecute a police officer and still win your job back as a prosecutor? The answer is yes, but you might have to work your ass off.\n\nAmericana: You write about thinking through the risks when you learned that Gov. Walz was going to give you the case. âWouldnât I be deciding based on how the outcome affects me personally? Isnât that wrong?â\n\nKeith Ellison: My mom was on my mind that day. Do you remember when that horrible tragic incident happened at the Pulse nightclub in Florida? And then John Lewis and some other members of Congress went down to the House floor and did a good old-fashioned sit in?\n\nAmericana: I do.\n\nKeith Ellison: So, I happened to be in my office talking to some constituents at the time. My secretary walks into the room, and she hands me a card with a note on it, which says: âYour mom said get to the House floor.â My mother had called my office. She saw that there was a sit-down on the House floor, and she expected her son to be at the party.\n\nThatâs the kind of woman that she was. She was a justice person. She would have been absolutely appalled by what happened to George Floyd. And she would have wanted me to do what was right.\n\nAmericana: You write this about the prosecutionâs strategy: âWe werenât putting policing on trial. As much as some protesters would have enjoyed that, it probably would have led to an acquittal.â What do you mean?\n\nKeith Ellison: Iâm aware of the larger historical political ramifications of chronic excessive force. Itâs historic and nationwide. Iâve been working on it for a long time. But it wasnât going to achieve the main goal here. And I think it would be slightly unfair, given the fact that I know so many cops who really do care about the safety of their neighbors, and signed up to protect that safety.\n\nIf this experience taught me anything, it is that we donât have to have fundamentally flawed policing in America. We have it, because we will not maintain accountability. We have it because we wonât fire people or discipline them when they violate rules. But Iâm convinced that the institution remains important and is honorable, and that we donât have to live this way.\n\nWe need to acknowledge that we do need armed agents of the state to deal with certain kinds of crime, violent crime. But we donât need armed agents of the state to handle every kind of crime. For example, maybe you can just send out some sort of counterfeit investigator to go deal with the George Floyd matter.\n\nAmericana: The response to that, especially from Republicans, is usually mockery. Oh, you want to send a social worker to a crime scene?\n\nKeith Ellison: This is all stuff Republicans hate because they believe in punishment, for others, not themselves. If youâre a low-income, poor person, they think the way to get you to do something is to inflict maximum pain on you. If youâre talking about themselves, they want the Donald Trump treatment, nothing bad. Nothing bad you do, you ever have to answer for.\n\nAmericana: You got re-elected, but you endorsed the Â Â measure to replace Â Â the Minneapolis police department, and that failed. Whatâs actually improved since 2020?\n\nKeith Ellison: That became one of my comebacks in the debates. âOh, Ellison supported this proposal to get rid of the police department and have a department of public safety.â I said: Well, youâre right. I did. I did support that amendment. But guess what, after it went down, the wiser people took over and we now have a department of public safety, and you have one person who can coordinate all these agencies. Weâre actually interested in saving lives, and youâre interested in trying to win an election through fear.\n\nWe overhauled the police officer standards and training system. The city of Minneapolis has banned no-knock warrants. St. Paul hasnât done a no-knock warrant since 2016. And we have police leadership that, in my opinion, really gets it.\n\nAmericana: You said earlier that we do need âarmed agents of the stateâ to deal with some crimes. Whatâs your response to abolitionists, who believe that policingâs inherently racist, and you make communities safe by funding them?\n\nKeith Ellison: So long as human beings are as they are, there will be rapes, there will be robberies, there will be domestic violence, there will be drive-by shootings. Even if you got rid of any kind of economic and social injustice, explain to me, why did Bernie Madoff rip off a bunch of people? I mean, people do evil things to each other who donât have to. Theyâre not from poor families. Theyâre not racial minorities. And they do bad shit.\n\nYou might not need to bust into Bernie Madoffâs house with guns pointed at his head. But to the degree that human beings hurt each other, you need somebody whoâs going to stop it, and hold them accountable after they do it. Thatâs why I could never get my brain around abolition. When you talk to the abolitionists, theyâll say that theyâre really talking about how a high percentage of the crime that we see is socially caused. Okay. That doesnât mean we get rid of the police. That means we may not need as many as we have now. And thatâs an empirical question.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Why The Killing of George Floyd Sparked an American Uprising\n\nT he killing of George Floyd was shocking. But to be surprised by it is a privilege African Americans do not have.\n\nA black person is killed by a police officer in America at the rate of more than one every other day. Floyd's death followed those of Breonna Taylor , an emergency medical technician shot at least eight times inside her Louisville, Ky., home by plain-clothes police executing a no-knock warrant, and Ahmaud Arbery , killed in a confrontation with three white men as he jogged through their neighborhood in Brunswick, Ga. Even Floyd's anguished gasps were familiar, the same words Eric Garner uttered on a Staten Island street corner in 2014: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nYet the timing and cruelty of Floyd's death, captured in a horrific video that shows the white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin casually kneeling on the victim's neck, has spurred a national uprising. Since Floyd died on May 25, demonstrations have erupted in scores of cities across the country as veteran activists and newfound allies alike rally to the cause of racial justice. The vast majority of the protests have been peaceful, with simple demands handwritten on torn pieces of cardboard. Enough is enough. Stop killing us. Justice for George Floyd. Those pleas have resonated around the world, producing expressions of solidarity from Europe to New Zealand.\n\nThe protests have also triggered civic unrest in America at a scale not seen since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Protesters burned a police precinct in Minneapolis, torched cop cars in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and dodged plumes of tear gas from Tulsa, Okla., to Madison, Wis. By June 2, the National Guard had been activated in at least 28 states, and dozens of cities had imposed curfews to quell looting, arson and spasms of violence. Militarized police surged cruisers into crowds, fired rubber bullets at reporters and beat citizens peacefully exercising First Amendment rights.\n\nFor 21⁄2 months, America has been paralyzed by a plague, its streets eerily empty. Now pent-up energy and anxiety and rage have spilled out. COVID-19 laid bare the nation's broader racial inequities. About 13% of the U.S. population are African Americans. But according to CDC data, 22% of those with COVID-19, and 23% of those who have died from it, are black. Some 44% of African Americans say they have lost a job or have suffered household wage loss, and 73% say they lack an emergency fund to cover expenses, according to the Pew Research Center. \"It's either COVID is killing us, cops are killing us or the economy is killing us,\" says Priscilla Borkor, a 31-year-old social worker who joined demonstrations in Brooklyn on May 29.\n\nIf the video was the match and the coronavirus was the kindling, Donald Trump provided the kerosene. Since the start of his term, the President has turned the Oval Office into an instrument of racial, ethnic and cultural division. A man who both-sided a white-supremacist march, went to war with NFL players protesting police brutality, called African nations \"sh-thole countries\" and told American Congresswomen of color to \"go back\" to where they came from was never going to appeal for harmony now. As the Floyd protests spread, Trump called demonstrators \"thugs,\" threatened them with \"vicious dogs\" and borrowed a phrase popularized by the Miami police chief Walter Headley in 1967: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nGiven the tone from the top and the grassroots anger, it's a surprise this confrontation didn't come sooner. The movement for racial justice was arguably the biggest story in America before Trump came along. Black Lives Matter began as a protest cry and bloomed into a political force: activists won convictions and shaped federal policy, seeding their message across college campuses and popular culture, in legislation and presidential platforms.\n\nIt wasn't enough, but it was progress, and to many activists, Trump looks like white America's response. \"Trump was elected in part because Black Lives Matter was winning,\" says Jessica Byrd of the Movement for Black Lives. \"Trump was our punishment.\" If so, he was an effective one. The President pokes sore spots in the body politic so incessantly that no single cause can sustain the nation's attention. Protest is a performance, and the audience Black Lives Matter found during the tail end of the Obama Administration has been subsumed into the broader anti-Trump \"resistance,\" which pinballs between outrages: the Muslim ban, children in cages, impeachment. In a way, Black Lives Matter has been a victim of its own accomplishments: it articulated a language of subjugation that could be applied to causes such as immigration or gender or class. Systemic injustice became about everything, rather than the original thing, which was police killing black people.\n\nThat hasn't stopped. From 2015 to 2019, according to statistics compiled by the Washington Post, police shot and killed 962 to 1,004 Americans each year. Black Americans are nearly three times as likely as white people to be killed by police, according to the database Mapping Police Violence. The killings are continuing apace this year. Except now it seems to many as if the nation has moved on. \"For us to get the attention that we need, we've gotta set things on fire,\" says James Talton, a 32-year-old New York fitness instructor. \"Because it seems like nobody's paying attention.\"\n\nNationwide riots, a virus that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, a President threatening to unleash the military on citizens-how much more can the country bear? Every day in this awful, exhausting year feels like rock bottom, and then we tunnel further into some hideous crawl space. More than 40 million jobs have vanished in 10 weeks. One in four Americans is out of work . And the reckoning continues.\n\nIt feels both terrible and fitting that the struggle poised to define the final months before a bitterly divisive election is a conflict that dates to America's founding, a force so powerful it can push even a once-in-a-century pandemic aside. Those who have fought for racial justice for years-for decades-are resolute. \"I believe that we have been working these past four years to get back in the ring with Trump,\" says Byrd. \"And I truly believe that we will win.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd died at dusk on Memorial Day, outside the Cup Foods grocery store at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in South Minneapolis. Floyd had bought a pack of cigarettes with what the clerk suspected was a counterfeit $20 bill. Three squad cars converged to confront him as he sat in the driver's seat of a blue Mercedes SUV.\n\nDerek Chauvin's was the last to arrive. Since joining the Minneapolis police force in 2001, Chauvin has been the subject of at least 17 conduct complaints, almost all of which were closed without discipline, according to city records. He was involved in at least three cases in which a police officer shot a civilian. Another of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest, Tou Thao, was the subject of at least six complaints, five of which resulted in no discipline (one is still under investigation). In 2017, Thao was sued in federal court for excessive use of force over allegations he beat up a suspect during an arrest. The city settled for $25,000, according to a legal filing. (Attorneys for Chauvin and Thao did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nChauvin and Thao are just the start. A review of federal and city records reveal a broader picture of impunity within the Minneapolis police department. A 2015 report by the U.S. Justice Department found that only 21% of conduct complaints against Minneapolis police were ever investigated. Only 13 out of nearly 1,200 complaints processed from October 2012 to September 2015 resulted in discipline, according to local news reports. In most of those cases, the police officer in question was sent for \"coaching.\"\n\nWhat disciplinary structures do exist are weak. The department's office of police conduct review can only make a recommendation to the chief, whose own decisions can be reversed. \"I have seen so many instances where the chief imposed discipline and an officer was fired, only to have it overturned or reduced,\" says Teresa Nelson, legal director of the ACLU in Minnesota.\n\nFor two decades, federal officials repeatedly recommended reforms to increase accountability, curb use-of-force violations and build up community trust, according to more than half a dozen government reports. But Minneapolis lagged behind most other metro police departments in implementing them. Experts say the department stands out for the permissive language of its guidance, which notes that the unconscious neck restraint can be used if the subject is \"exhibiting active aggression\" or \"active resistance.\"\n\nThe results have been evident on the streets. Since 2015, Minneapolis police have rendered people unconscious with neck restraints like the one Chauvin applied to Floyd at least 44 times, according to an NBC News analysis; in three-fifths of those cases, the subject was black. Black residents were about nine times more likely than whites to be arrested for low-level offenses, according to a recent ACLU study. \"People in this community have been very concerned about the Minneapolis police department for a long, long time,\" says Hans Lee, a pastor at Calvary Lutheran Church. \"It was a tinderbox.\"\n\nPolice brutality has also made Minneapolis a locus of racial-justice activism. After the 2014 killings of Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., protesters occupied the Mall of America and shut down freeways. In November 2015, after Jamar Clark, an unarmed black man, was shot and killed in North Minneapolis, protesters established an encampment outside a nearby precinct for 18 days. The following year, after Philando Castile was shot in a Minneapolis suburb by police during a confrontation livestreamed in part by his girlfriend, activists thronged the governor's mansion for weeks.\n\nLike the rest of America, Minneapolis activists have faced new challenges under Trump. The 45th President has exacerbated the tensions between police and communities across the country, unwinding some of the key criminal-justice reform measures that President Obama had championed. Trump's first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, reinstated a program that allowed the Pentagon to send state and local police forces surplus military equipment like armored vehicles, grenade launchers, bayonets and battering rams. Sessions restricted the Obama Administration's use of consent decrees, which are court-ordered agreements to overhaul local police departments accused of abuses and civil rights violations. He also scaled back a voluntary program Obama created to help reform police departments.\n\nShortly after 5 P.M. on June 1, a line of nine military trucks carrying National Guard troops in helmets and tan camouflage uniforms slowly rolled onto the White House grounds and down a narrow alley near the West Wing. The trucks' canvas tops passed just below the windows of the offices of the President's chief of staff, Vice President and National Security Adviser, and turned along a fence line typically filled with tourists snapping selfies before the building's iconic North Portico.\n\nThe rare display of military might outside the seat of American power was only the beginning. \"I am your President of law and order,\" Trump declared in the Rose Garden, just before curfew descended on Washington on the seventh night of national unrest. Trump threatened to deploy \"thousands and thousands\" of \"heavily armed\" military personnel to quash the protests. As he spoke, officers fired rubber bullets and sprayed chemicals to disperse demonstrators outside the White House gates. Shortly after, twin-engine UH-60 Black Hawk and UH-72 Lakota helicopters swept just above the tree line over the capital's streets, buzzing a crowd of protesters with a downwash of air, debris and fuel exhaust in an apparent \"show of force,\" a maneuver used to cow insurgents in combat zones.\n\nTrump's aides believe the confrontations will play to the President's political advantage in the run-up to the November elections. The unrest \"really makes you want tough, Republican leadership,\" a White House official says. \"People do not want their streets to be lit on fire.\" Campaign advisers see in the chaos a reprise of 1968, when Richard Nixon successfully courted white voters with coded racism against African Americans after years of sporadic urban rioting.\n\nNot all Republicans are convinced. \"Trump's re-election chances are going down in flames,\" says Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor and Trump supporter. \"It's hard to see how these riots don't boost Joe Biden's claim to be the Alka-Seltzer America needs to soothe its stomach right now.\" Stuart Stevens, a Trump critic who served as chief strategist to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, notes that Trump won in 2016 with 46% of the vote because nonwhite turnout declined for the first time in 20 years. \"You can call them protests, but you could also call them nonwhite voter-turnout rallies,\" Stevens says of the racial-justice demonstrations. \"It's hard to imagine anything that's going to be more motivating.\"\n\nEven before Floyd's death, race relations in America were regressing. Trump has emboldened a burgeoning white-supremacist movement. Hate-crime violence reached a 16-year high in 2018. Roughly two-thirds of Americans told Pew Research Center last year that expressions of racism have grown more common during his term. \"There is literally a brewing civil war that is happening,\" says Alicia Garza, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter.\n\nBut moments of grace have emerged from the miasma of pain and despair. In Camden, N.J., police locked arms with activists and marched along with them. In Flint, Mich., the Genesee County sheriff removed his riot gear, laid down his weapons and embraced protesters. From Fayetteville, Ark., to Omaha, police took a knee in solidarity.\n\nTwo hours before Trump left the White House for a photo op at a burned church, before the sting of noxious chemicals wafted across Lafayette Square and a line of officers on horseback charged peaceful protesters, Anya Colon stood in sight of the White House columns, holding a Black Lives Matter poster. Her grandmother had marched in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to push local authorities to allow black people to vote. Now Colon, 38, had driven seven hours from Rome, N.Y., spurred by a sense of duty. \"Trump catalyzed a lot of racism,\" she says. \"We have to do some things that make change. This marching has been going on for decades. I had to be here. Something from inside my gut drove me and pulled me here.\" She had come with her cousin Iliana Arthur, 41. Arthur also held a sign. It read: We matter.\n\nWith reporting by Alana Abramson, Brian Bennett, Tessa Berenson, Vera Bergengruen, Philip Elliot and Lissandra Villa/Washington; and Jasmine Aguilera, Charlotte Alter, Josiah Bates, Paul Moakley and Olivia B.

      "text": "The Overlooked, Enduring Legacy of the George Floyd Protests\n\nT he Department of Justice's findings from its investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), released June 16, 2023, just over three years after the murder of George Floyd, were a stunning indictment of the longstanding culture and practices of the department. DOJ's investigation found that MPD routinely uses excessive force, discriminates against Black and Indigenous people, violates the First Amendment rights of protesters and the press, and provides an unlawful response to people with behavioral health disabilities. The report is also a stark reminder of the general failure of policymakers to respond to the summer of 2020's widespread protests calling for the end of persistent cycles of police harassment and violence, especially against Black people.\n\nA closer look at the post-2020 reform landscape, however, reveals that the calls for change after the murder of George Floyd helped accelerate the emergence of alternative first response: a field of practice with the potential to profoundly shift the scope of policing nationwide.\n\nAlternative first response programs send non-law enforcement personnel to respond to and deescalate a wide variety of calls for help: mental health crises, welfare checks, noise complaints, traffic accidents, and other low-level disputes that can take up over half of a police officer's job . Since 2020, a growing number of cities across the country have begun to pilot these programs. Though these pilots can trace their roots back to longstanding isolated programs like Eugene, Oregon's CAHOOTS, a mental health crisis intervention program that started in 1989, the demands for reform after the murder of George Floyd were the catalyst that sparked countless municipalities to invest in these alternative first response programs.\n\nMany of these pilot programs have now grown into full-fledged operations. Albuquerque's Community Safety department (ACS) takes nearly 3,000 calls for service a month, around half of which are diverted from the Albuquerque Police Department. ACS is a cabinet-level public safety department, now deeply embedded into Albuquerque's first responder system alongside police, fire, and EMS. Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina has consistently praised ACS, welcoming the reduction in call volume . He's not alone: Police leaders and rank-and-file officers across the nation are all in agreement that they respond to far too many types of calls. Rather than focus on law enforcement, ACS responders focus on connecting people to resources that can resolve their problems, like housing, mental health care, a ride across town, or just someone to talk to. ACS's monthly reports consistently include accounts of individuals connected to these resources-outcomes not likely with a police response.\n\nAlbuquerque is only one of dozens of programs that have taken root since 2020, the precise scope of which is different from city to city. Dayton, Ohio's Mediation Response Unit is dispatched to resolve disputes between neighbors, family, or friends. Denver's STAR program is expanding to cover mental health calls 24/7 . Despite programs responding to hundreds of thousands of calls nationwide, no alternative response program has yet reported the death of a responder on the job, and no responder has killed the person calling for help .\n\nDOJ's report should help further cement the trend. Its findings in Minneapolis mirror what communities across the country have been telling their policymakers all along: The decision to send law enforcement to many behavioral health-related calls for service is \"often harmful and ineffective,\" and thus is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. DOJ also pointed out that crisis intervention training of MPD officers wasn't sufficient to fix the problem.\n\nThe shift towards non-police responses to mental health and other calls for service is a consequential one. One in five police killings involve a person in mental health crisis. But just as important, a system of alternative first response represents a framework in which cities begin to respond to people with the care they need-not just the gun, badge, and handcuffs we have available.\n\nA 2020 study by the Vera Institute found that of the 240 million calls made to 911 each year, the majority do not require a response from police, fire, or EMS; the potential number of nationwide calls taken by alternative first response programs runs in the hundreds of millions, not the hundreds of thousands. But despite the incredible growth of alternative first response programs, they are still too small to make a serious dent in this number. City and county policymakers need to start thinking about and investing in alternative first response on a commensurate scale.\n\nCongress may have been unable to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act or any other police reform measures in the aftermath of 2020's protests, but Congress plays a limited role in crafting public safety strategies. The most critical developments in policing were always likely to start in cities and counties, which is where policymakers decide how the bulk of public safety resources are allocated.\n\nIf the most enduring legacy of the George Floyd protests ends up being the development of an alternative first response system that fundamentally reshapes the way jurisdictions provide assistance to their residents, it will be a legacy to be proud of.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "3 Years After George Floyd's Murder, Cop Culture Still Hasn't Changed\n\nO n a mild late spring night in 1993, a police officer in Berkeley, California, stopped a black-and-yellow two-door Chevy for a traffic violation. The officer was twenty-one years old, white. He was working a midnight shift in a lower-income neighborhood adjacent to North Oakland that had seen more than its share of violence, much of it linked to the trade in crack cocaine. The year before, 12 people were murdered in Berkeley, then a city of 103,000. Nearly 900 were robbed and more than 700 were victims of aggravated assault, putting Berkeley's violent crime rate at twice the national average.\n\nAt 1:30 a.m., the officer was driving north on a mixed commercial and residential street. A block ahead, the Chevy was stopped at a red light in the left turn lane. Not waiting for the light to turn green, the driver lurched forward, veering out of the lane to continue straight. This was hardly a serious offense. The streets were empty, no oncoming traffic. Still, it was illegal. The officer hit his overhead lights. \"Adam 13, 11-95,\" he called on the radio. Car stop. One of a dozen he'd probably make that night.\n\nExcept the driver accelerated. The officer couldn't tell whether he was trying to get away or hadn't noticed the police car. Nor could the officer know that the events to follow would speak directly to one of the most pressing issues of our time today, three years after the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin : how to fix the police, a troubled American institution. Although many police officers - most, perhaps - do their difficult jobs admirably and well, incidents of egregious abuse are all too common and police reform has proved an elusive goal.\n\nThe solution has been apparent for decades, the major barrier to its implementation politicians and police chiefs who lack the vision and commitment necessary to carry it off. Cop culture, which the Berkeley officer was in the grips of, needs an overhaul.\n\nAt the next street, the Chevy went left. The officer followed but the car had vanished. The only place it could have gone was Stanton, a small street that branched off, and as the officer drove past it, he caught sight of the car's brake lights. He slammed on his own brakes, backed up, and barreled down Stanton until he reached the Chevy, which had parked in the driveway of a stucco house.\n\nLike most small- to midsize police agencies, the Berkeley police department, with 180 cops in the early 1990s, didn't have its own police academy. When the officer joined as a recruit, he was sent to the academy run by the city of Sacramento, held on the grounds where the California Highway Patrol trained. There the future men and women of law enforcement took their morning runs; the recruits all idealistic in their own way, driven to scratch some inner itch by pinning on a badge. Trainers taught them that car stops can be dangerous, even for minor infractions. Usually drivers and passengers are cooperative. But you never know-you might pull over someone with a felony warrant who'll do anything to keep from getting arrested, or a dealer with a stash and a gun hidden under the front seat, or a guy with anger issues looking for a fight.\n\nPosters hung in the gymnasium, where the recruits practiced defensive tactics. One showed the CHP Survival Creed: \"The will to live, to survive the attack, must be uppermost in every officer's mind. Fight back against all odds. Don't let them kill you on some dirty freeway.\"\n\nSacramento police academy recruits were trained to be on high alert when stopping cars. The cardinal rules were that you had to keep everyone contained, and hands had to be visible at all times.\n\nThere was no containment happening on Stanton Street. As the officer pulled up, a young man about his age, Black with cornrows, stepped from the passenger side of the Chevy. He was shirtless, with pale blue shorts and blue Nikes. The driver had stayed at the wheel. The officer yelled to the passenger, \"Get back in the car and close the door!\"\n\nThe man said flatly, \"Why?\"\n\n\"I'm stopping this car. Get back in and close the door.\"\n\nThe man ignored him. He began walking toward the porch of the house, only a few paces away. While trying to keep his eye on the driver, the officer ran to the passenger and put his hand on his shoulder. The man flung it off. \"If you touch me again, I'm going to kick your ass,\" he said.\n\nThe two were face-to-face. The man had threatened a cop; he was going to jail.\n\n\"Get on the ground, you're under arrest,\" the officer ordered. He wanted the man seated or prostrate so it would be harder for him to make good on his threat. The officer had followed every twist of the Rodney King case, but he wasn't thinking about the symbolism of a white police officer ordering a Black man to the ground. He was thinking: if this guy's willing to fight rather than sit in a car while I write his buddy a ticket, there must be something he doesn't want me to know or find. His other thought was, don't let them kill you on some dirty freeway.\n\nHe called for cover.\n\nThe driver, also Black and in his twenties, was out of the car now, too. The passenger again made a move toward the porch. This time, the officer grabbed him, pushing him against the hood of the Chevy, intending to apply handcuffs. The man pulled loose and swung at the officer, clocking him on his cheek. The officer stumbled a couple of steps and drew his baton. Few police had access to Tasers back then (the LAPD officers who assaulted Rodney King were an exception), so batons were the best nonlethal option.\n\nNow the officer upped his radioed request to \"Code 3\" cover-for an emergency. Sirens kicked on in the distance along with the intermittent beeping on police frequencies that signals trouble.\n\n\"Get on the ground! You're under arrest!\" the officer kept repeating, thwacking the passenger in his leg while the man stood ready to box. He grabbed the baton, but the officer wrested it back and hit him again in the leg, then once in the abdomen, a jab he'd been taught in defensive tactics.\n\nHis partner from the next beat over came running to cuff the driver. Meanwhile, an older couple had emerged from the house-the passenger's parents, it would later turn out-and were trying to restrain their son. The officer saw why: he was holding a sizable rock over his head and was about to throw it.\n\nA third cop arrived and rushed to help arrest the driver. The first officer unholstered his handgun, a stainless steel .40 caliber Smith & Wesson, and pointed it at the rock-wielding passenger, lining him up in his sights so he'd have a clean shot. \"Put the rock down!\" he screamed. After a tense moment, the man did as he was ordered. The officer wasn't faced with the choice of shooting him in front of his parents or taking a rock to the head.\n\nThat Berkeley officer was me.\n\nWe never figured out why the passenger had fought. He had an arrest record but wasn't on probation or parole. He had no warrants and no contraband on him. He'd been drinking but wasn't drunk. Taken into custody, all he would say was, \"I'll be out, Gross. I'll find you.\"\n\nThe stop that night on Stanton Street should never have escalated as it did; the outcome could have been horrific. The passenger wasn't blameless. He should have gotten back in the car when I asked. He shouldn't have threatened me or punched me in the face or tried to throw a rock. But I wasn't blameless either. Nor was the police institution that molded me into the cop I was.\n\nAs a rookie, I checked all the right boxes. I was born and raised in the Berkeley area and would be policing my hometown. I was educated. I was young but not completely inexperienced: I'd worked part-time for several police agencies while in college, including as a dispatcher. I had a clean record. I'd gone into policing with the best of intentions, to help people and make the community safer. And yet there I was, gun in hand, fighting with a young Black man over what? Over nothing, really.\n\nWhat went wrong? I served as a Berkeley police officer for eleven months before quitting and going to graduate school to get a PhD in sociology, looking for answers to questions just like that. I've been a social scientist for more than two decades now, and I've thought often about the Stanton Street fight with a mixture of guilt, sadness, and dismay.\n\nAt Colby College in Maine, where I teach courses about the police, I sometimes assess proposals for police reform by asking whether they would have prevented the kind of escalation that occurred. Could the whole incident have been avoided if my training had been different? If the department had different policies in place? If the police academy hadn't taught me to be paranoid about car stops, perhaps I wouldn't have perceived a passenger walking away as such a threat. If California had mandated meaningful de-escalation training for officers, maybe I would have thought to use a calmer tone or to say something less hostile than \"get on the ground.\" Maybe I would have retreated after the man threatened me and waited for the arrival of more officers so that we could have arrested him safely through sheer strength of numbers. If department policy had established that lethal force could be used only when there was absolutely no alternative, maybe I would have ducked for cover when it looked like rocks were about to fly instead of drawing my weapon.\n\nMaybe. But probably not. You can train and rewrite policy all day long, but done in isolation, that won't get you very far. If you've got a department full of cops who think of themselves as aggressive crime fighters locked in a life-or-death struggle against the forces of evil- which is how many officers saw themselves, even in liberal, educated Berkeley-then alienation and resentment are bound to spread in heavily policed neighborhoods. In the heat of the moment, you won't see police backing down.\n\nPolicy change is crucially important. But to fix policing, we need to change cop culture: the values, beliefs, and assumptions, the worldview of those in law enforcement. Right now, not enough people are talking about how to do that.\n\nIn the wake of the massive Black Lives Matter protests that followed the death of Mr. Floyd, a Vox/Data for Progress poll found that large majorities of likely voters supported such police reform ideas as mandatory use of body cameras, collecting better data on use of force, and banning choke holds. Likewise, a CNN poll found that a mere 14 percent of American adults believed that \"policing works pretty well as it is,\" and 53 percent favored major changes to the institution, with the remaining 32 percent preferring smaller-scale reforms.\n\nPoliticians at the federal, state, and local levels (primarily on the Democratic side of the aisle) tried to address this demand for change. Federal legislation (ultimately stalled in the Senate) sought to forbid choke holds and \"no-knock\" warrants, reduce liability protections for police officers, require implicit bias training, and much more. States, for their part, upped de-escalation training, instructed officers to intervene if they see their peers engage in misconduct, and changed laws governing the use of lethal force. Cities increased citizen oversight of police operations, pulled police out of schools, and even prohibited police officers from doing low-level traffic enforcement.\n\nYet whether well-conceived or not, each of these plans for reform will quickly run up against a limit: the aggressive culture of policing that characterizes many American departments. That culture prioritizes above all tactical safety, putting bad guys behind bars, loyalty to other cops, and not taking flak from anyone on the street. Policy changes perceived to be at odds with those values-basically, anything that constrains the options cops have in dealing with what they see as dangerous people and situations-will be resisted and undermined at every turn.\n\nWe've been here before. After the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests and unrest, President Obama assembled a task force charged with developing a vision for policing in the twenty-first century. The task force issued policy recommendations, but its central insight was that policy change alone isn't enough to ensure good policing. \"There's an old saying,\" the task force noted: \"'Organizational culture eats policy for lunch.'\" \"Any law enforcement organization can make great rules and policies,\" the report continued, \"but if policies conflict with the existing culture, they will not be institutionalized and behavior will not change.\" The reason for this is simple: in policing \"the vast majority of an officer's work is done independently outside the immediate oversight of a supervisor.\" Thus \"consistent enforcement of rules that conflict with . . . culture . . . is nearly impossible.\"\n\nDespite the report's emphasis, proposals for reform today typically aim at regulating or limiting the power of the police, not changing police culture. Politicians and pundits talk occasionally about the need for law enforcement officers to view themselves as \"guardians\" rather than \"warriors,\" but it's difficult to know what that distinction entails, let alone how agencies could move in such a direction. It's as though policy makers can't imagine what ethical, effective, democratic policing might look like.\n\nBut the culture of policing can be transformed. Three unusual police departments, dedicated to replacing the aggressive crime fighter with something different and better, have worked to come up with healthier, more socially responsible models of what it means to be a good cop. Many police forces promise change; these three-in Stockton, California, Longmont, Colorado, and LaGrange, Georgia-are walking the walk. The chiefs in those agencies and the officers and detectives who work for them have invaluable lessons to teach all of us on the importance of leadership, creativity, perseverance, and the involvement of everyday citizens when it comes to changing how police officers approach their job. These cops also have remarkable personal stories to tell, stories that shed light on the real world of American policing, which bears little resemblance to its portrayal by political partisans of the left or right.\n\nThe challenges this country faces in getting the professional, equitable, and humane policing it needs are formidable. The aggressive culture of policing I encountered thirty years ago prevails in many departments, and racial inequities are entrenched.\n\nAmid national outrage about police abuse, the temptation has arisen to either write off policing or impose a plethora of legal and policy restraints to bring police into line. But we can't write off the police, not in the foreseeable future. And while restraints on police behavior are needed, public institutions like the police need more than rules to function effectively. They also require an animating spirit, a culture, one that offers employees a sense of mission, purpose, and identity, and that steers them toward doing the right thing. Changing cop culture must become a new national priority.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "What the Artists Behind George Floyd Murals Around the World Want Us to Remember\n\nN o art form embodies the creative response to the collective grief, outrage, and protest that followed the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd like the mural does. In the two years since Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minn., about 2,700 pieces of street art around the world have been created in response to his death, according to the George Floyd and Anti-Racist Street Art Database. Artist have emblazoned walls, sides of buildings, and stretches of streets with his image and the words \"I can't breathe\" and \" Black Lives Matter. \"\n\nThe mural has long been one of the most engaging, if most ephemeral, forms of communicative art-a primarily public form, they've often served as a tool for revolution, community building, and remembrance. From Minneapolis to Bethlehem, here are five murals from around the world honoring Floyd, with reflections two years later from the artists who created them.\n\nAt the intersection of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis, Minn., a space now known as George Floyd Square in honor of the man who died there, offerings are laid in front of a brightly colored mural that depicts Floyd's face in front of a blooming sunflower. The flower is detailed with the names of other victims of police brutality in the U.S. The mural is the creation of artists Cadex Herrera, Greta McLain, and Xena Goldman, who painted the piece on the side of the Cup Foods grocery store, a block away from where Floyd was arrested and killed .\n\nFor Herrera, the mural was a way to honor Floyd with respect and to disrupt the dehumanizing narratives that were emerging in the wake of his murder in the media.\n\n\"We wanted to portray George Floyd with humanity and personhood, someone was part of his community,\" he tells TIME. \"He was a family man, a person that had life and spirit and brought joy to so many people in his community.\"\n\nHerrera, whose art practice is grounded in social justice, says the piece was painted just a few days following Floyd's murder and was a community effort. It was one of the first murals to pay tribute to Floyd, and the beginning of a larger creative response to the murder and to police brutality across the globe. Herrera hopes that the mural's legacy is one that sparks social change.\n\n\"I hope that it has opened up the conversation about police brutality and that we keep a close eye on all of the sort of atrocities that have been committed by law enforcement,\" he says. \"Hopefully, this art piece is just a small part of the wider movement and wider conversation as to what we need to do to stop these things from happening.\"\n\nFor artist Jesus Cruz Artiles, also known as EME Freethinker , hearing about the fatal police brutality that Floyd experienced was discomfortingly reminiscent of a violent incident he witnessed as a teenager growing up in the Dominican Republic. Feeling both anger and hopelessness, he wanted to take action in the way he knew best: street art.\n\n\"I just wanted to say something, to do something,\" he tells TIME. \"This is a movement happening around the world.\"\n\nIn the days following Floyd's murder, Artiles painted a mural honoring him in the public park Mauerpark, which is famous for its strip of the former Berlin Wall , which has become a destination for graffiti artists. According to Artiles, who has created many pieces on the wall, while it's commonplace for murals to be painted over in days, his mural of Floyd lasted far longer than any of his other work-something he considers to be a testimony to the importance of its message.\n\n\"We need to raise our voices against police brutality, against racism, because these things keep repeating,\" he says. \"I don't want to have a reason to paint a mural like this again.\"\n\nOn Israel's separation wall running through Bethlehem, Palestine, a large mural of Floyd features the caption, \"I can't breathe. I want justice, not O2.\" The image is the handiwork of Palestinian artist Taqi Spateen , who considered the parallels between the Black Lives Matter movement and the fight for Palestinian liberation as he created the mural.\n\nFor Spateen, the caption, which draws on Floyd's famous last words, is a way to make a statement on how dignity and respect are just as vital for human life as oxygen is. \"To be a human means many parts; we don't just breathe oxygen, we breathe freedom, justice, peace, respect,\" he says. Spateen's decision to create the mural on the controversial wall of the West Bank is symbolic-he says he found connection between racism in the U.S. and ethnic cleansing in Palestine. \"The wall is the face of racism, of occupation, it is something against humanity,\" he says. He sees making art there as an act of resistance.\n\nAlongside his mural of Floyd, Spateen also painted one of Iyad Al-Hallaq, a Palestinian man with autism who was shot and killed by Israeli police shortly after Floyd was murdered. This was to show the shared struggle of Palestinians, Black Americans, and all oppressed people.\n\n\"If I didn't do it, I [would] feel like I'm not using my art-because to be an artist is to have a responsibility to care about humanity,\" he says.\n\nWhen artist Allan Mwangi, known as Mr. Detail Seven , first saw the footage of Floyd's murder in 2020, he felt a rising surge of anger about the injustice of the incident and the all-too-real threat of police brutality. The Nairobi-based artist knew it would be fruitless to just sit with this intense emotion, so he channeled it into art, creating a vibrant mural alongside his fellow artist, Bankslave, in the capital's Kibera neighborhood.\n\n\"When I saw that video, it hit a nerve,\" he tells TIME. \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to express the way I feel about the whole situation by doing the mural.\"\n\nThe mural pays homage to the life of Floyd and also calls out the horrors of police brutality; in another section of the wall, it depicts a police officer standing on top of a citizen. Adjacent to the drawing of Floyd's face, the Swahili word Haki , which means \"justice\" is painted in bold, oversized letters.\n\nReflecting on the mural two years later, Mwangi believes the issue of police brutality that he tried to address through his art is still as urgent as ever, in both the U.S. and in Kenya, but he hopes that his piece has sparked more dialogue about the issue.\n\n\"I hope it's a reminder that we are all human,\" he says. \"There's no need to ever treat each other in such a way.\"\n\nFor Aziz Asmar, Floyd's murder was intimately familiar, even if it happened halfway across the world. Filled with sorrow, he created a mural for Floyd on the remnants of a building that he says was a family's kitchen before an airstrike destroyed it.\n\n\"The way he was killed, it is the same of thousands and thousands of people who were killed in the same way in Syria,\" he says, speaking via an interpreter. \"Our revolution is based on justice-we are against injustice totally. When George said, 'I can't breathe,' I felt the same feeling and decided to draw the mural.\"\n\nAsmar, who teaches art workshops for children in Idlib, the last rebel-held enclave in Syria, says that turning to art in the face of injustice has been a way for him to reclaim his humanity, something that he believes is a universal desire.\n\n\"Drawing is a world language everyone can understand,\" he says. \"We are all brothers around the world, and we just want peace.\"\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com"

      "text": "Black Excellence Is Not Just a Hashtag. It's an Economic Lifeline\n\nW hen I first saw the news about George Floyd , it was a thumbnail with a summary describing a police officer kneeling on a man's neck. I chose not to pursue that news item. I didn't want to think about where it would take me, because I knew I would be confronted by my own helplessness. That feeling has become familiar, linked to a particular pattern of violence in which the common denominator is the color of our skin.\n\nThese events hold deep resonance in the U.K. It's very hard as Black Britons to keep our story on the forefront of the national agenda. And as conflicting as it is, the attention and outrage that is felt around African American injustices is useful to us in explaining what we are going through here.\n\nThis moment presents us with opportunities. It is a time in which we are reminded that we have common problems, and despite the distance and diversity between us as Black people, we have to find common approaches to solving those problems. It has recently dawned on me that much of white Britain doesn't culturally identify with white America in the way that Black Britain often does with Black America. It's therefore understandable-though not excusable-that so many of our white compatriots struggle when their society is shamed for producing similar racist outcomes to the U.S. The entrenchment of racist ideology across the West is not part of our compulsory education . White people often find themselves bewilderingly late to the conversation, and revert to a defensive stance. But come on. Over here, Black men have double the unemployment rate of white men , Black children are four times more likely to be arrested than white children and Black women are five times more likely to die in childbirth than white women. Blackness and whiteness occupy different areas of modern society. There is, of course, a flipside to this; our artistic tradition also holds its own unique place in the world.\n\nNot by consensus nor intention, but by default, we are a political bloc confronted with social and economic disadvantages that show up everywhere, irrespective of our individual lifestyles. African Americans have a fraction of the wealth of white Americans . A report in 2017 showed that 40% of Black households in the U.K. are living in poverty . This is not something we've coordinated, and it's not a coincidence. What we have in common that drives our economic conditions is a shared history of exploitation, interference, sabotage and abuse at the hands of white societies. All of that comes rushing back when I see Derek Chauvin's knee on George Floyd's neck .\n\nI grew up in one of the blackest parts of the U.K. St Raphael's Estate, my neighbourhood in North West London, is 46% Black, while the U.K. has a population that is 3% Black . The first thing you know is your family, then you know your street, then pretty quickly you know the world. The messages you receive about this world travel through the media, and those stories will plug you in to a broader narrative of what your dark skin means. My mum used music, and she played me Bob Marley's Buffalo Soldier when I was too young to know how old I was. She used each line to explain the transatlantic slave trade. Over the years, as my consciousness took shape, I listened to more rap music and heard things that aligned with the reality I was living in. Eventually, studying Sociology at school and then university taught me how to frame the common narratives of rap music academically. Two books that do this expertly are: Natives by (actual rapper) Akala and Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge .\n\nFor Black people, our position in the economy is preventing us from building momentum against the effects of racism. Career is how we all make money, and therefore dictates our time. If our attention is dispersed across the economy in a way that does not reflect our common history, then we are unable to unify our energy against the problem in an organized, sustainable manner. What we need is an understanding across the economy, between Black people, that we are committing to strengthening our response to racism. I'm talking about a plan on a scale we haven't seen in our lifetime. It's ambitious, but we now have the technology and more importantly the historical lessons to redesign our freedom strategy. This is not going to happen overnight, but in the arts and entertainment industry, this is very much underway.\n\nTo plan an economic route for Black children, we'd need a strong starting point; one that sensitively acknowledges the past but offers a truly blank canvas for the future. Through arts and entertainment, Black people have refined this approach for a century. From Jazz to Ska to Hip Hop to Grime to Afrobeats, our musical innovations have passionately explained our journey, giving insight into our distinct intellectual brilliance, winning over the hearts and minds of onlookers worldwide, and most importantly, introducing wealth into communities that were at best overlooked, at worst brutalised by their governments. We have something here. 2019 saw a 19% rise in the use of stop and search among London's black population. That same year, sales of UK rap singles rose by 20.9% - driven largely by London's black youth.\n\nPeople often bemoan the stereotype of Black public figures falling into the sports and entertainment categories. It is a trope that carries connotations of inferior intelligence - but where did that association come from? Who, at some point in their lives, hasn't viewed sporting and artistic excellence as the perfect distillation of human potential? Furthermore, who says we can't build our presence in other professions around this foothold? Your favourite artist has a legal team. Your favourite athlete has a medical team.\n\nWe all have a part to play in reversing the effects of racism, but I would argue that no industry has had a greater influence on race politics than entertainment. The unique advantage that we have in the arts is the focus on our story; in this space, our economic activity is tied to the social needs of our community. Do we need more rappers? We need the wealth rap generates, and the discursive space it creates. We don't have a combination like that anywhere else in the economy. Do we need more athletes? We need to capitalize on the respect they command, and apply it beyond the sale of products that have nothing to do with our struggle. Our focus should not be on convincing white people to work and think in a different way, as great as that would be. Instead, we should concentrate on playing to our strengths and reinvesting our diverse skill set into the political bloc we find ourselves in by default. Black excellence is not just a hashtag: it's an economic lifeline.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "'Art Can Touch Our Emotional Core.' Meet the Artists Behind Some of the Most Widespread Images Amid George Floyd Protests\n\nB uilding a protest movement during a pandemic requires creative - and virtual - work. For illustrators and artists with social platforms, their output has an attentive audience - and an influential role to play, in parallel to the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests sweeping the country. Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis during an arrest on May 25 after Floyd gasped for air as an officer weighed down on him with a knee on his neck. The officer involved, Derek Chauvin, was since been fired and initially charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter . (Derek Chauvin now faces an upgraded second-degree murder charge .) As artists are aware, their responses can help build narratives of empathy and focus action on what matters.\n\nThe movement has seen large-scale marches and clashes with police in cities across the U.S. and abroad as late May turned to June, and has also grown online as support for anti-racism actions and systemic change against police brutality has become a dominant virtual conversation . While the act of re-sharing a portrait or re-tweeting a slogan has drawn criticism as potentially empty, the process of building solidarity through symbolism has played a core role in the history of protest , especially amid a pandemic that may rule out in-person activism for some. In the wake of Floyd's death, social media sharing has helped to dissolve the distances between local pain and global outrage .\n\nCreators have taken different approaches as they engage. For some, it's a continuation of their activist spirit. For others, Floyd's death marked a shift into newfound political involvement and more serious subjects. Millions of reposts later, however, one thing is certain: the conversation is still in its nascent stages. With that in mind, we asked artists about the creative process behind some of the most resonant original imagery of the moment. Much of the most popular works reimagine the subjects at hand, giving us new ways to grasp what's going on.\n\nFor Nikkolas Smith, an L.A.-based artist and activist who calls himself an \"artivist,\" there has never been a divide between the work he publishes and the justice-oriented goals of his creative endeavors. On May 29, he shared a digital painting commemorating George Floyd .\n\nLike most of Smith's portraits - many of which focus on other victims of police violence, like Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor - the style evokes a traditional oil painting, but is rendered almost as an abstraction. (He makes them in PhotoShop, and gives himself under three hours to complete them.) And the unfinished quality is intentional. Smith says it's meant to echo the unfinished business of these lives, cut short. \"I don't like clean lines,\" he tells TIME. \"That's a parallel to all these lives. They did not have a chance to see their end. They should still be living.\"\n\nSoon after posting his Floyd portrait, it was shared by Michelle Obama, among other celebrity fans. It was spread further by the official Black Lives Matter Instagram account, with whom he collaborated from the start. In fact, it soon became one of the widespread original images of the latest protest movement.\n\nSmith coupled his image with a caption that calls for justice for Floyd, but recognizes that just the act of viewing and sharing is a powerful first step. \"Even if there isn't an action item, people are still seeing an image of a human being. The narrative is building up more and more that these are people who should be on this earth who are not here anymore, and their life is important,\" Smith says. \"To share it, even if it's just that, is important. I'm hoping that all of this leads to a bigger, more substantial change, especially with accountability of law enforcement.\"\n\nSmith is no stranger to protest art. He was working as a Disney theme park designer in 2013 when he first captured attention for his illustration of Martin Luther King, Jr. dressed in a hoodie , meant to cast doubt on preconceptions of the differences between the civil rights leader and the young Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager shot by George Zimmerman in 2012. Smith has been creating works with political and anti-racist themes ever since.\n\nOn the other hand, Illustrator Tori Press's latest Instagram post was a departure for her. In 2016, Press checked out of her own freelance nine-to-five gig to focus on illustrating full-time, as an emotional response to the election that year. But she has always shared lightly humorous personal anecdotes with bits of advice about self-care and managing mental health in a signature style of pastel watercolors and black ink text - until now. \"I'm not very political,\" Press told TIME. \"It's not really something I wander into all that often. But in the wake of this murder, I've been sick all week. I couldn't stay silent.\"\n\nThe result: \"If you want non-violent protests, listen to non-violent protestors,\" reads her latest post in large black letters, with a small kneeling figure of former NFL quarterback and social justice activist Colin Kaepernick in the corner; it has over three times the likes of the prior post. \"When something like this happens, and people are righteously angry, and justifiably so, but you hear folks being dismissive of the entire cause - I just think that's a way to dismiss this fury, and the reason behind it,\" she said. Press added that she feels particularly responsible to share this message as a white, privileged woman with a platform.\n\n\"I drew Colin Kaepernick because he's a perfect poster child for someone who tried to make a peaceful protest, and was absolutely vilified for it. It's just infuriating,\" she said. \"We need to have space to say, yeah, I recognize how furious you are.\"\n\nAs she says in her caption, she feels there is a role for white people to play. \"I can address my fellow white people and say look, this is a time we all need to stop and reflect. Really put yourself in the shoes of people who are angry right now, who are protesting. Have some empathy.\" She hopes her illustration will help \"at least a few people\" to have that moment of self-reflection.\n\nEric Yahnker , a California-based satirist who has displayed his absurdist works in fine art galleries, laid aside his typical tongue-in-cheek tone when he published his latest Instagram post: another George Floyd portrait, done in colored pencils on a sheet of kraft paper as a \"gut reaction\" to Floyd's death.\n\n\"I am absolutely unimportant in this story,\" he said to TIME. He chose to draw Floyd as the \"gentle giant\" he was described as by friends, reflecting his \"soft humanity.\" \"It absolutely guts me that if Mr. Floyd were a white gentle giant or anything other than black, he'd still be alive today,\" Yahnker notes. \"As a Jew, indoctrinated since birth to the scores of my own ancestry massacred by the hands of evil forces, I know full well that silence itself can be a painfully violent and oppressive act.\" On its own, Yahnker knows a single piece of art can't create real change. \"But I am a firm believer in the power of the collective. If we all put a drop in the bucket, it can turn into a tidal wave,\" he says.\n\nOne of the most widely circulated images is an illustration from Shirien Damra . It's a pastel, color-blocked portrait of Floyd that sees him wreathed in flowers, one in a series of similar portraits Damra has done for people who have recently fallen victim to violence. Damra, a former community organizer in Chicago and a Palestinian-American, turned to this form of commemoration in order to spread awareness in a way that avoided sharing videos that she said can be \"traumatic and triggering,\" she told TIME. \"I think art can touch our emotional core in a way that the news can't.\" Damra adds that one thing artists can do is help illustrate what comes next.\n\n\"We know what we don't want. We don't want any more black lives targeted by police and white supremacy. But one thing that I have found we struggle with is actually imagining what kind of things we do want to see in our world,\" she says. \"I feel like as artists, one role we could play is allowing ourselves and others to reimagine the possibilities. Our society will likely never turn back to how it used to be before the pandemic and everything happening right now. Art can be a powerful catalyst in bringing more people together to take action.\"\n\nDamra's Instagram account is only a year old. But especially in the pandemic era, people are turning to the digital sphere to consume art perhaps more than ever, by default. \"This has opened up a way to reach more marginalized communities who need art most during this heavy time,\" she says.\n\nAnother popular image is a gesture to the Black Lives Matter movement by the French artist duo Célia Amroune and Aline Kpade, who go by the name Sacrée Frangine. Like a spin on an earth-toned Matisse cut-out, their trio of Black faces - overwritten with the \"Black lives matter\" slogan - is a universal statement that is just abstract enough to be repurposed in many ways; protesters have even drawn versions of it for signs at marches. Amroune and Kpade may not be U.S. citizens, but they told TIME they feel \"very close to\" the movement. This has, after all, had a wide reach. The comments to their art are a chorus of \"thank-yous\" and heart emojis, with the promise of sharing.\n\nAs social media was overtaken by \" blackout \" trends on June 2, these works momentarily disappeared from feeds. But they will resurface again.\n\n\"Some people who never spoke out before - when Mike Brown or anybody else was killed - they saw this video, they see this art, and say, now I'm going to say something,\" Smith said about what's different this time around. \"I don't even really know where things are gonna go from here, but it's getting to a boiling point. People are done. They're going to make their voices heard.\"\n\nAs for Smith, his latest piece of art, called \"Reflect,\" isn't a portrait but a depiction of a single masked protester, kneeling at the foot of a line of riot-gear-clad policemen and raising a mirror to their hidden faces. \"Can we just hold up a mirror to what this looks like right now?\" Smith wants to know. That's what contemporary art is for, after all: to refract back reality, and raise questions about what we are willing to accept.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com"

      "text": "The Uncertain Future of George Floyd Square\n\nT he line between opportunism and responding to the reality of public curiosity isn't always clear. In and around George Floyd Square-the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was murdered , two years ago this Wednesday-it can be particularly hard to find.\n\nIn the days after Floyd's death, as Minneapolis became the epicenter of a widespread movement , activists and advocates flocked here to offer various forms of aid, ranging from free used clothing to medical care for protesters and area residents. A free community library and a church-basement food pantry were still in operation when Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd, went on trial about a year later. And every once in a while someone would show up ready to sell passersby something; one vendor had a folding table and socks bearing an image of George Floyd's face. Today, the area's a little less busy, a little less flooded with people and their various motives.\n\nYet it remains the subject of an ongoing debate over how best to memorialize a man whose death jolted some of the nation-at least temporarily-out of complacency.\n\nIn the aftermath of Floyd's death, the area around Chicago Avenue and East 38th Street was barricaded, transforming what had once been an ordinary pair of streets into what some called an \"autonomous zone,\" a self-ruled site of protest and commemoration, a gathering space to recognize the magnitude of what had happened here: A man had been murdered under a police officer's knee, as a crowd pleaded for mercy on his behalf and a teenage girl recorded it all, putting the truth about problems with American policing in front of every face willing to look.\n\nAfter the barricades went up-first hand-painted signs propped against sawhorses and chairs; later, concrete defenses much like the ones stationed outside the White House-most vehicles were barred from the area. At one barricade was a sign that delineated the rules developed by activists who at the time convened nightly in a gas-station parking lot there. Another simply declared to the reader, \"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE FREE STATE OF GEORGE FLOYD.\" On Chicago Avenue, where most of the memorial sits and where Floyd drew his last breath, an artist hand-painted the names of 169 Black, Latino, and Asian people killed in the United States by vigilantes or police. Residents and even city officials have reported that, for a while at least, police kept their distance. In the first year after Floyd's killing, cruisers were sometimes seen in the surrounding area but would not enter the square, several told TIME. But there was also often a kind of eerie, unstable sense of peace.\n\nIn September 2020, nearly a quarter of respondents to a city questionnaire indicated that they wanted \"justice\" first, before the city began implementing even an interim design for a next phase of George Floyd Square. But the autonomous zone wouldn't last.\n\nBy February 2021, the city announced plans to reopen the area after Chauvin's trial concluded. A city survey released in the next month found that just 3% of respondents wanted all \"barricades, art, and other community installments\" removed. Chauvin was convicted April 20, 2021. Then, on June 3, city work crews arrived early in the morning to begin removing concrete barricades from the four corners of the square , eventually placing smaller ones in an irregular semicircle around the offerings left at the spot where Chauvin killed Floyd. A citizen-made roundabout, centered on a nearly two-story-high sculpture of a brown clenched fist, remained. Agape, a community organization that operates one of the city's violence-interruption teams inside and around the square, helped the city's public works staff access the area, creating a satellite controversy over their involvement. (Agape leaders said at the time that they would rather play a part than have the city clear the intersection without community involvement). B y the end of July , traffic was back to the corner of 38th and Chicago.\n\nOfficially, neither the city nor those who work and live in the area want the square to return to what it was before 2020. While there are real people who live, work, and find community at what is now called George Floyd Square, there are activists and concerned people all over the city and the world who have strong opinions about the answer to that question, says Sasha Cotton, director of Minneapolis' Office of Violence Prevention. That dynamic has left the city with a perplexing challenge.\n\nThe city has launched a project meant to \"re-envision\" the intersection while \"[balancing] traditional asset management needs with the intersectionality of justice, healing, placemaking and culture,\" and has begun the process of soliciting input from the community. In April, project leaders held their first forums on the subject. Test buses have been sent down both 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, past the square, in what some here see as the first part of a plan to restore service that was in place before Floyd's killing. At a candlelight vigil this week, official city street signs will be installed denoting the boundaries of George Floyd Square, open to traffic but still regarded by many as a sacred space to reflect on what happened here, what was exposed, what has been lost.\n\nWhile the idea of making the designation official may sound like an honor for Floyd's memory, not everyone engaged with the subject sees the city's efforts as helpful. Jeanelle Austin, for one, who lives in the area and is the executive director and co-founder of the George Floyd Global Memorial, finds deeply objectionable what she sees as an attempt to turn George Floyd Square into a tourist attraction.\n\nShe is also the memorial's lead curator, meaning she has been the one to organize others willing to help collect and preserve the 5,000-odd offerings that have been left at the place Floyd died, and to protect that memorial from people who have tried to use it as a backdrop for everything from political speeches to commercial pursuits. This year, as a committee planned a multi-day event dubbed \"Rise and Remember,\" to mark what Austin call's Floyd's \"angelversary,\" the calls started again, she says. People would tell her they wanted to visit the square on a \"pilgrimage,\" but then reveal plans to bring along a film crew, for example. Politicians want to come too, she says, even ones whose own records on racial justice may be seen as a reminder that, as one area violence interrupter told me, Floyd wasn't the first Black man hurt by American government here and he wasn't the last. The physical reminders of some others have simply been removed. (Austin shared with TIME emails between organizers about a potential visit by Sen. Amy Klobuchar , which never panned out; Klobuchar's staff told TIME that the Senator did not make a request to speak during Rise and Remember, but that she is supportive of efforts to pursue racial justice.)\n\nIn thinking about her duty to the square, Austin looks to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.-not the often-sanitized version of his story that is \"put on repeat every single year,\" but the cautionary tale of how the policies and practices he most wanted to see are not supported by some white Americans who claim to admire King. Words can lose some of their power if vision isn't translated into action. Or, as King, the pastor, might say, faith without works is dead.\n\n\"Last year we put together what we thought was going to be a glorified block party and it became even bigger than that,\" says Austin. \"This year, George Floyd's aunt and cousin, who serve as co-directors of our board, were like, 'We want to do this every year.' What we want to do is level it up to a national festival. We want this to be a kind of annual gathering that people all across the country can come to, to remember stolen lives and to rise up and pursue racial justice.\"\n\nAustin is also one of the main organizers of an exhibit held at Minneapolis' downtown Orchestra Hall last week, a display of some of the thousands of letters, protest signs, art, candles, beads, and flowers left behind at the spot where Floyd died. Accompanying the exhibit, the Minneapolis Orchestra performed \"Seven Last Words of the Unarmed,\" a choral work about three Black men killed by police or vigilantes. Rise and Remember begins on Wednesday.\n\nAnd official suggestions about ways to \"adjust\" or alter the memorial keep coming. The mayor, Austin says, suggested that a street art installation-which consists of the names of people of color killed by police or vigilantes, painted on the asphalt-be replaced with memorial bricks akin to Stolpersteine . But the city's vision, Austin says, isn't specific enough to the actual content of what people were protesting in the wake of Floyd's death nor the ugly role race has played in American history. Austin says when she made that point, the mayor quickly agreed.\n\n\"I don't think I nor any individual elected official should dictate the outcome and the feel of George Floyd Square,\" Mayor Jacob Frey tells TIME. \"We want the ideas and vision very much to come from community-and by the way, [the] community has some dramatically different ideas and perspectives as to what they want to see. That shouldn't surprise anyone. No community is a monolith and I think George Floyd Square is a prime example of that. But I do see this ultimately as a really beautiful opportunity to honor our Black community and George Floyd's legacy, to have Black-owned businesses up and down the corridor there which we are working towards right now. Of course, to have a memorial. But that's not for me to dictate.\"\n\nIn other words, there may be as many opinions about the future of the square as there are people, and city officials will have to contend with that. And they will also have to be prepared to deal with the sense of righteous indignation that some people who have been thinking about that question for a long time now will feel about any others determining the square's fate.\n\n\"To even develop George Floyd Square is to erase the narrative,\" Austin says, \"This is not a tourist destination. This is a sacred site. This is a place of protest.\"\n\nThis year, the George Floyd Global Memorial foundation will begin working to develop a kind of docent entrepreneur program that will allow a set of caretakers to guide groups on scheduled tours of the area for $25 a person fee, with about 10% of those funds going to the foundation. The goal is to help people in the area develop small businesses they control and to help generate the funds to not just maintain the outdoor memorial but also develop a museum that will tell the stories of what Austin calls the \"many souls\" lost in encounters with police from 1950 forward. Floyd's space matters because not every family who lost loved ones in similar ways has had the privilege of people holding room for them, Austin says.\n\nThe goal, she says, is to ensure that the opportunities that come to Central remain connected to the actual community and the events that happened here. No matter who ends up deciding what the next phase looks like for George Floyd Square, that connection will have to be key.\n\n\"That is the hard part about this work of racial justice,\" says Austin. \"You constantly have to ask the question, what does justice look like? What is the right thing? What is the next step? How do we do this for everybody?\"\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com"

Houston-based artist Ange Hillz, meanwhile, went to work: in 24 hours, he created this week's TIME cover portrait of Floyd, to accompany a story from TIME's Janell Ross .\n\n\"My choice was to use a lot of color to represent all of the colors of people who supported this outcome... all of the diversity\" Hillz tells TIME. \"I was so happy for the family, the world was happy.\"\n\nBut in a testament to how tenuous this moment of joy and resolution is, Hillz delivered the final artwork from an airport in Minneapolis while en route to the funeral of Daunte Wright , another unarmed Black man recently killed by a police officer (and whose death occurred while Chauvin's trial was in session). \"The work continues, we're not going to stop\" said Hillz, well aware of what remains to be done to dismantle structural inequality and systemic racism in the U.S.\n\nHillz has built a lasting relationship with the Floyd family over the past year, having first met them when he created a speed painting of Floyd at the family's private funeral in Houston last June. Since that day, Hillz says he has communicated with family members regularly.\n\nIt is a revolutionary act to create such a likeness of a Black man like George Floyd, who would only normally be visible if he were a celebrity-or a perceived menace. And it is radical to render him as he was: a father, a son and a brother; an ordinary man who, in death, has attained near-iconographic status. The image exists as a tribute to Floyd's humanity, and this tenuous American moment of possibility.\n\n\"All we need is equality,\" says Hillz. \"Nothing more, nothing less.\"\n\nGet a print of TIME's George Floyd \"Justice-Not Yet For All\" Cover\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "A Family and City in Mourning: Intimate Scenes From George Floyd's Funeral\n\nA fter Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, Brooklyn-based photographer Ruddy Roye started to think differently about his work. \"I told myself the work I pursue personally would be about educating my sons,\" says Roye, 50. \"My reason for being out here is to capture different scenarios to share with them that they're second-class citizens. Their rights do not come as normal and natural as the rest of America - that there are different rules for black people.\"\n\nRoye has documented stories of black struggle and resilience for TIME, including in the aftermath of the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling by police officers in the same week in July 2016, but the time he spent in Houston for the funeral of George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, was \"one of the most emotionally draining\" photo shoots he's ever done.\n\nRoye shadowed the family from June 7 to June 9, and he had the opportunity to speak with Floyd's son, Quincy Mason, about finding the strength to move forward. \"I put my hand on his chest and [said], \"Just breathe and understand that this is your father,'\" Roye says. \"I was seeing on TV all that power and all that energy that's been generated by the moment where these family members are in the background. We, the people who are not intimately attached to the family, we see a revolution. We find solidarity and empathy with the family, but to us it's a movement. To them, it's their family member. They're overwhelmed. They were crying. They were in pain. So I had to walk that line of recording history and empathy. When I was with the family, I couldn't be a part of the movement. I had to be in the lane of empathy and strength for the family, and when I wasn't with the family, I could photograph like I was documenting history.\n\n\"I was in the front seat, watching a family that had been catapulted onto an international platform quickly, watching them rise to the occasion on so many levels, and be an example for, tragically, the next family that might have their family members killed, taken away from them. In every choice they made, they are effecting change.\"\n\nRoye, whose own sons are now 11 and 15, found hope in all the mourners who came out to the public viewing of Floyd's body on June 8 and en route to the cemetery on June 9, especially in a 10-year-old boy Engwin Williams. The light shining through his yellow poster of George Floyd's face with the words \"I can't breathe\" caught Roye's eye. \"I asked him why he came out today, and he said, 'To show George that we're with him,'\" Roye said.\n\nWith reporting by Olivia B.

      "text": "The Story Behind TIME's George Floyd Cover\n\nF or the June 15, 2020, cover on the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd , we turned to prominent American artist Titus Kaphar.\n\nKaphar's 60′′x60′′ oil painting, titled Analogous Colors, features an African-American mother holding her child. To complete the work, Kaphar cut out the canvas to show a mother's loss: Floyd called out to his deceased mother during the 8 minutes and 46 seconds he was pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\n\"Mamma!\" Floyd, 46, called out. \"Mamma! I'm through.\" Floyd's mother, Larcenia Floyd, died May 30, 2018, nearly two years to the day that her son was killed.\n\n\"In her expression, I see the black mothers who are unseen, and rendered helpless in this fury against their babies,\" writes Kaphar. \"As I listlessly wade through another cycle of violence against black people, I paint a black mother ... eyes closed, furrowed brow, holding the contour of her loss.\"\n\nFor the first time, surrounding Kaphar's painting, the red border of TIME includes the names of people: 35 black men and women whose deaths, in many cases by police, were the result of systemic racism and helped fuel the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement . Their names are merely a fraction of the many more who have lost their lives because of the racist violence that has been part of this nation from its start.\n\nThe names are Trayvon Martin, Yvette Smith, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald, Tanisha Anderson, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Jerame Reid, Natasha McKenna, Eric Harris, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, William Chapman, Sandra Bland, Darrius Stewart, Samuel DuBose, Janet Wilson, Calin Roquemore, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Joseph Mann, Terence Crutcher, Chad Robertson, Jordan Edwards, Aaron Bailey, Stephon Clark, Danny Ray Thomas, Antwon Rose, Botham Jean, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.\n\nIn a piece accompanying the painting, Kaphar writes, \"This black mother understands the fire. Black mothers understand despair. I can change nothing in this world, but in paint, I can realize her. That brings me solace ... not hope, but solace. She walks me through the flames of rage. My black mother rescues me yet again. I need to be sure that they can see her. I want to be certain that her story is told. And so this time, America needs to hear her voice.\"\n\nRead \"I cannot sell this painting\" by Titus Kaphar.\n\nKaphar, who received an MFA from the Yale School of Art and was the recipient of a 2018 MacArthur Fellowship \"Genius\" Grant, also created a painting for TIME in 2014 marking the protests in Ferguson, Yet Another Fight for Remembrance , which captured black protestors, arms raised up and obscured with layers of white brushstrokes.\n\nHis commitment to social engagement has led him to move beyond traditional modes of artistic expression: Kaphar established NXTHVN , an arts incubator and residency program based in New Haven, Conn. His work is in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art and The National Portrait Gallery in D.C., among others\n\n\"I have given up trying to describe the feeling of knowing that I can not be safe in the country of my birth,\" says the 44-year-old artist, who was born in Kalamazoo, Mich., and now works in his New Haven studio. \"How do I explain to my children that the very system set up to protect others could be a threat to our existence? How do I shield them from the psychological impact of knowing that for the rest of our lives we will likely be seen as a threat?\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump says he isn't considering pardoning Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's murder\n\nWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump said Friday he is not considering pardoning Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer convicted for his role in the death of George Floyd , nor was he aware of an influential conservative podcaster's push to reprieve Chauvin of federal charges.\n\n\"No, I haven't even heard about it,\" Trump said when asked whether he's looking at pardoning Chauvin at the request of his allies. \"I haven't heard of that.\"\n\nBen Shapiro, founder of the Daily Wire, this week launched an online petition calling for Trump to pardon Chauvin, who in 2021 was sentenced for 22 and a half years in prison on state charges for second- and third-degree murder, and 21 years on federal charges for depriving Floyd his civil rights when he knelt on top of Floyd's neck for nine and a half minutes as he lay on a Minneapolis sidewalk in May 2020.\n\nTop White House adviser Elon Musk quickly embraced the idea, writing in a post on X , \"Something to think about.\"\n\nFloyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man, died after being stopped by Chauvin, a white police officer, during a May 25, 2020 traffic stop in Minneapolis as he arrested him for using a counterfeit $20 bill. A teenager's video footage of Floyd struggling to breath beneath Chauvin's knee sparked weeks of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 and reignited the Black Lives Matter social justice movement.\n\nOn his podcast this week, Shapiro argued Chauvin did not receive a fair trail because of the widespread attention to the case including former President Joe Biden's discussing the case publicly. Shapiro pointed to Floyd's preexisting heart condition, arguing \"the evidence demonstrates certainly (Chauvin) was not guilty beyond reasonable doubt\" despite both a federal and state jury's verdict otherwise.\n\nShapiro who attended Trump's joint address to Congress on Tuesday as a guest of Speaker Mike Johnson, said the \"the railroading of Derek Chauvin\" fueled the 2020 protests that led to property damage in some cities and he contends hurt race relations.\n\nChauvin is serving his state and federal prison sentences concurrently. Pardoning Chauvin for his federal charges would not change his state conviction.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Here's what to know.\n\nMinneapolis is gearing up for this month's trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged in George Floyd's death, which led to nationwide protests and calls for an end to police brutality last summer.\n\nOn May 25, Chauvin was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd cried out that he couldn't breathe. Floyd, who was accused of using a a counterfeit $20 bill, was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by three officers during the arrest. Chauvin continued to press his knee into Floyd's neck minutes after he became nonresponsive as bystanders repeatedly asked officers to check for a pulse.\n\nChauvin and three other officers were fired a day after Floyd's death and were charged the following week.\n\nFloyd's name became a rallying cry as protests spread to more than 1,700 cities and towns in all 50 states and around the world.\n\nIn Minneapolis, thousands of protesters demanded the officers be held accountable and called for police reform . Though many demonstrations were peaceful, businesses were looted on several nights, and a police station was burned.\n\nLast month, city officials began solidifying security plans and establishing a security perimeter around City Hall, nearby buildings and the courthouse where jury selection will begin Monday. Streets will be closed, businesses will be boarded up and National Guard troops and hundreds of law enforcement officers will be in place in anticipation of potential unrest during the trial, set to begin March 29.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the trial will probably increase trauma for many, especially as the verdict draws near, and safety will be a top priority.\n\n\"We believe it is on us to honor the magnitude of this moment and ensure that our families in this city feel safe,\" Frey said.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the trial of Derek Chauvin:\n\nJury selection was scheduled to begin Monday but was delayed until at least Tuesday , while an appeal proceeds over the possible reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge. The prosecution and defense are set to start opening statements March 29.\n\nChauvin's trial will be broadcast on Court TV and USA TODAY will be livestreaming the court proceedings.\n\nVisual and audio recordings are not typically allowed in Minnesota courtrooms without authorization from a judge. Cahill upheld his decision to livestream the trial in December because of immense global interest in the case and limited courthouse space.\n\nTwo members of the media will be allowed in the courtroom. The USA TODAY Network is sending a team of journalists who you can follow on Twitter for updates as the trial begins: Tami Abdollah , Eric Ferkenhoff , Trevor Hughes , Clairissa Baker and N'dea Yancey-Bragg .\n\nIn May, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, but he may face additional charges. A Minnesota appeals court ruled Friday that third-degree murder charges should be reinstated against Chauvin.\n\nThat count was dismissed in October by Judge Peter Cahill, who said that charge would apply only if a defendant put multiple people in danger and someone died. (According to Minnesota law, third-degree murder involves \"perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind.\")\n\nThe three other former officers involved - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. They are scheduled for trial together in August.\n\nChauvin posted a $1 million bond in October and was released from state prison.\n\nThis is not the only time Chauvin may face legal repercussions related to Floyd's death.\n\nThe Department of Justice launched an investigation in May into whether Chauvin and the other officers violated Floyd's civil rights. Last week, new witnesses were called and a new grand jury was empaneled in that investigation, according to the Star Tribune and The New York Times.\n\nAttorneys representing Floyd's family filed a civil lawsuit in July in federal court against Chauvin, the other officers and the city of Minneapolis. The lawsuit claims that the officers used excessive force and violated Floyd's constitutional rights and that the city is liable because it failed to properly train the officers.\n\n'He'll never see her grow up': George Floyd mourned by children, family, friends and strangers\n\nThe trial will be held in the Hennepin County Government Center Courts Tower in downtown Minneapolis. The building, which has been the site of multiple demonstrations, is surrounded with barbed wire and concrete barriers.\n\nChauvin will be tried separately to adhere to physical social distancing restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to an order from Cahill.\n\nOnly those with approved credentials will be allowed inside the courtroom, including one member of the Floyd and Chauvin families, according to an order Cahill issued Monday .\n\n\"This has been a deeply painful and emotional year for every member of the Floyd family, many of whom intended to be in the courtroom to witness this trial,\" family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement Tuesday. \"While they understand the judge's reasons to limit attendance in the courtroom, the family is understandably disappointed by this ruling.\"\n\nA group of more than 100 protesters gathered for a demonstration outside the courthouse Monday organized by more than a dozen activist groups, including Black Lives Matter Minnesota and Communities United Against Police Brutality.\n\n\"The people demand justice for all stolen lives. Convict all killer cops,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"Derek Chauvin represents what is wrong with police in Minneapolis and in this country, and now is the time to demand due justice for George Floyd and set the precedent in seeking justice for every stolen life.\"\n\nThe George Floyd Global Memorial canceled a planned gathering with faith leaders at George Floyd Square after a fatal shooting over the weekend, the group said on Facebook.\n\nHow did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to nationwide outcry after George Floyd's death\n\nFloyd's death was one of several high-profile incidents of violence against African Americans - almost all involving police, all but one fatal.\n\nAmid nationwide protests, other police officers and chiefs have been fired, resigned or charged; states and cities announced they were cutting funding for police departments and criminalizing the use of deadly restraints ; and federal lawmakers introduced a sweeping police overhaul bill bearing Floyd's name.\n\nSeveral grand juries declined to bring charges against officers accused of killing unarmed Black people.\n\nProtests kicked off in Kentucky after no Louisville police officers were charged with killing Breonna Taylor when they fired their weapons into her apartment last year. In New York, grand jurors declined to bring an indictment against officers involved in the death of Daniel Prude, 41, who died in Rochester.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg"

      "text": "For a moment, George Floyd's murder changed everything. Those days are gone.\n\nEvery time a Black person is killed by police, Minneapolis native Alicia Crudup thinks about her boys.\n\nThe 42-year-old is a married mother of six sons, ranging from age 11 to 21. She runs a non-profit aimed at mentoring kids in need of support and partnering them with adult role models in the community.\n\nWhen George Floyd was killed, on May 25 2020, during America's coronavirus lockdown, Crudup remembers a downpour of commitments too numerous to count.\n\nFortune 500 corporations were making gigantic financial pledges and tiny arts groups were hired to install Black Lives Matter murals on public spaces, all vowing that this tragedy represented a spark to eliminate racial disparities.\n\n\"There was an opportunity here and across the country to enact change in many areas, long-lasting change,\" Crudup told USA TODAY. But \"I feel like we really missed an opportunity to do that. ... All of the talk was really just that ‒ a lot of talk.\"\n\nNow instead of historic achievements, she lists more setbacks. That fatigue and frustration is being echoed by dozens of voters, community activists, civil rights leaders, scholars and elected officials who spoke with USA TODAY four years after Floyd was suffocated by a white officer's knee to the neck.\n\nThey say the legacy of Floyd's murder is an example of more than a resistance to police accountability, but a larger and sophisticated backlash movement that quashes any attempts at racial justice.\n\n\"I have mixed emotions because I hear from some who remain committed. I hear from others deafening silence,\" said Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League.\n\n\"I see evidence of backlash in many quarters, and I feel in many parts of Black America the idea is, 'here we go again.'\"\n\nThe counteractions over the past four years are widespread, observers say, such as the Supreme Court knocking down affirmative action admissions policies used to diversify college campuses; Republican-led legislatures stamping out Black history courses in public education; and extinguished diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nEven symbolic wins aren't safe, experts say, highlighting opposition to \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" ‒ often referred to as the Black national anthem being sung at sporting events, to a Virginia school board this month moving to restore the names of Confederate leaders to two local schools .\n\nAnd last year, the police killed more Americans than any other year on record.\n\nJason Williams, an associate professor of justice studies at Montclair State University in New Jersey, said there's been a \"very major backlash\" in the wake of Floyd's death.\n\n\"I think ground zero for that project is our colleges and universities where entire DEI departments have been dispersed,\" Williams said.\n\nThe failure of Congress to pass a sweeping reform package in 2021 , dubbed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act , spurred candidates and elected officials to use \"cultural politics as a political football,\" Williams said, which is almost certain to bleed into the 2024 presidential contest.\n\n\"This sort of repression against the George Floyd effort is on steroids, especially now considering that we're in an election cycle where the GOP is using that very movement as part of the ammo to their base,\" he said.\n\nBut amid widespread pessimism some police reform advocates point to flickering progress. Those still in the trenches say efforts to establish alternative public safety models at the local and state level underscores that Floyd's ghastly death was not completely in vain.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the viral video showing Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes 29 seconds, according to state prosecutors, Washington appeared ready to unclench its partisan fists.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who rarely criticized police action, called it a \"very sad event\" in a May 27, 2020 tweet . \"Justice will be served,\" he said.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Americans polled in a July 2020 Gallup survey said policing needed \"major changes.\" Another 36% said at least minor changes were required versus just 6% who said the country should do nothing.\n\nEven after Trump lost reelection, there was a bipartisan commitment with Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., launching a year-long quest to draft a police reform bill that the Senate could agree upon. That eventually foundered under irreconcilable differences and changing political winds.\n\nBooker said he will continue to press for more support to pass federal legislation.\n\n\"While the call for reform was distorted to score political points, the facts remain the same,\" Booker said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We must pursue police reforms that enhance public safety and also improve transparency, accountability and justice.\"\n\nNeither Scott nor his office responded to USA TODAY's request for comment. Scott spent much of his short-lived run for president downplaying racism in the United States.\n\nLed by a fiercely right-wing counter-movement, Floyd's image was recast from victim to a boogeyman embodying the social ills some associate with America's cities . His death, GOP critics said, paved the way for looting and violence led by left-wing radicals.\n\nThat sentiment remains prevalent among conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill today, who argue Americans are more focused on crime.\n\nPolice officers, these members say, have been the ones mistreated and targeted by violence since 2020.\n\n\"I hate that our entire police force is connected to George Floyd all the time,\" Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, said in a recent interview outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Police protect this country. We support our officers now more than ever,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-Pennsylvania, said ahead of a House vote.\n\nRepublican Christopher DeCruze, 39, of Trumbull, Connecticut, believes the 2020 summer may have been \"counterproductive.\"\n\n\"Results of the protests - the general public outlook on police - caused, I think, an initial reaction that ... led to an increase in crime,\" DeCruze said.\n\nMore recently, leading up to the fourth anniversary of Floyd's murder, the Republican-controlled House flexed its law-and-order record during this month's National Police Week by passing several bills backing the blue.\n\nGOP lawmakers won approval for legislation supportive of the police, including laws that require the quick arrest and deportation of any immigrant accused of assaulting a law enforcement officer; undermine changes the D.C. city council had made to sentencing rules and youth offender status; and require the Attorney General to submit a report on violent attacks against law enforcement officers.\n\n\"We're obviously trying to move legislation to support police officers and stand with cops,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told USA Today. \"We stand firmly behind police.\"\n\nOutside of Congress, Republicans on the ballot this fall are using as a wedge issue \"defund the police\" ‒ a slogan that became common among the political left during the Floyd protests, but which Democrats have long since abandoned.\n\nOther GOP officials who spoke with USA TODAY, however, said while their support for law enforcement is solid, additional reforms in terms of training and other procedures are worthwhile for Congress to pursue.\n\n\"We've always got to improve and by improving we'll instill more confidence in the general public. We need everybody to have an understanding that 96% of police are good people,\" Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pennsylvania, told USA TODAY.\n\nMeuser noted that Americans are more anxious about crime (which rose during the pandemic, though it has since fallen ), with 63% describing it as either extremely or very serious, according to an October 2023 Gallup survey. He said rather than fueling trends that could worsen police-community bonds, policymakers should look to mend those relationships.\n\n\"I want kids to understand police are there to truly protect and serve,\" he said.\n\nHundred of miles from Congress in Minneapolis, the city where Floyd lived and ultimately perished, Rosemary Nevils Williams thought Floyd's murder would be a wake-up call for her hometown as well as the country.\n\nShe said enough hasn't been done to repair what has been broken between the city's Black and indigenous communities and law enforcement.\n\n\"It has to definitely change,\" she said. \"It can't go on the way it is.\"\n\nDespite recent falling crime rates in the city, Nevils Williams, a 75-year-old retired teacher and social worker, said seeking social justice means confronting the continuing bigotry and institutional barriers in areas like housing and education head on.\n\n\"The racism is still really profound, the killing of young Black men is just still overwhelming,\" Nevils Williams said. \"Society feels like we're almost back to the 60s.\"\n\nIn the years since Floyd's death, residents and activists said there is a growing sense that America's race relations have worsened across the board.\n\nDozens of states have adopted or proposed measures that critics say omit crucial parts of U.S. history . Some states have also banned books, many of them by Black authors that focus on race and/or sexual identity.\n\nProponents argue these books are offensive and that key parts of Black history are already taught in schools. Supporters of so-called \"anti-woke\" laws said such measures protect against teaching divisive issues and blaming current generations for past injustices such as slavery. Republicans have particularly attacked an academic framework known as critical race theory ‒ which argues that the legacy of slavery and racial discrimination continues to shape today's world ‒ calling it \"woke indoctrination.\"\n\nFurther up the ladder of power, the Supreme Court eliminated affirmative action policies at major American colleges , which has spawned deeper concerns among progressives in education and others who fret this could embolden attacks on workplace diversity efforts.\n\nStephen Graves, an Oklahoma State University political science professor at the Center for Africana Studies, said it is notable that what he calls anti-Black measures are happening in a year that marks the anniversary of several civil rights milestones, such as the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision of 1954 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nHe said opponents to those achievements have spent decades aiming their message at white resentment, which has fortified a powerful resistance to any racial justice movement.\n\n\"They have figured out the recipe,\" Graves said. \"They still have enough pissed off, disenfranchised and uneducated white men in this country to where every time, every little semblance of Black progress, you name it, they automatically spin that into zero sum games: 'They're getting it, you're not getting it.'\"\n\nAccountability for law enforcement officers doesn't register as a top issue for Americans.\n\nA March Gallup survey asked voters to rank issues by importance, and half or more said they worry \"a great deal\" about inflation, crime, homelessness, federal spending, the economy and the affordability of healthcare. Police reform didn't make the cut.\n\nRace relations was a top priority with 35% of voters overall, the poll showed, and the same percentage of independents. That figure jumps to 47% among Democrats, but just 22% with Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have had a political tightrope to walk this election year.\n\nIn 2020, President Joe Biden featured Floyd's sister in a campaign ad and was vocal about the prevalence of police brutality across the country.\n\nAt his State of the Union Address in 2022, however, the president took time to criticize the idea of cutting money for cops.\n\n\"Let's not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice,\" Biden said. \"We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police. Fund them with resources and training they need to protect our communities.\"\n\nGrassroots organizers and their allies across the country tell USA TODAY the president's stance was to be expected, but there is much for them to be encouraged about.\n\nThey point out how several organizers have been pushing the ball forward with small victories at the local level.\n\nMonifa Bandele is a chief adviser with MomsRising, a progressive-leaning grassroots organization that focuses on maternal justice issues.\n\nShe said while the response to the 2020 protests has been daunting, it is a sign of how powerful that movement was.\n\n\"The backlash is coming because such a clear threat has emerged to the status quo, to mass incarceration to mass criminalization,\" Bandele said.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, for example, roughly 62% of the largest U.S. cities adopted some type of alternative public safety response program, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nThe center's research shows 25 states changed rules directly related to the circumstances of Floyd's murder, namely curtailing use of force, such as banning chokeholds, requiring officers to intervene in instances of police misconduct and forcing local agencies to report officer misconduct data to the state.\n\n\"On a local and state level, we've passed over 100 bills in George Floyd's name. So we have been having victories on every level except the federal level,\" Benjamin Crump, a nationally recognized civil rights attorney who has represented the Floyd family, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It's those laws that give me hope, gives me optimism that we will give our children a better America going forward.\"\n\nOthers point to reforms in how cities respond to crime.\n\nIn Albuquerque, New Mexico, city leaders diverted roughly $17 million in police funding to establish a new community safety department.\n\nThe pilot initiative has reportedly taken more than 50,000 service requests, directly diverting about 33,000 calls from police since it launched in fall 2021, according to the Vera Institute , a national nonprofit aimed at ending mass incarceration.\n\nDozens of other cities have adopted \"transform 911\" programs that send unarmed civilian first responders to certain emergency calls. In 2022, for instance, officials in Dayton, Ohio, established a Mediation Response Unit that dispatches mediators to low emergency situations, such as barking dogs, neighbor disputes and child custody exchanges.\n\nOrganizers say residents seeing these alternatives taking root in their backyards can make it easier for voters to support a reimagining of public safety.\n\nPolling conducted this year by GenForward, a center out of the University of Chicago , shows two-thirds of Black Americans favor exploring divesting from police and investing in some policing alternatives.\n\n\"You wouldn't have that before 2020,\" Bandele said. \"So this is a powerful, powerful moment. The backlash is because people's minds are changing and because people are having some very, very good experiments on the local level, which is where all this happens.\"\n\nMonifa Bandele\n\nMovement veterans say the goal of changing American policing hasn't faded, but the emphasis has shifted.\n\nThose frustrated with failed promises by elected leaders are focusing on electoral politics in 2024 while many more have flocked to join other grassroots movements, ranging from anti-gun violence campaigns to demanding reparations for slavery.\n\nIn Maryland, Tiffani Evans, 36, canvassed mostly Black neighborhoods ahead of the state's May 14 primary, urging people to vote.\n\nEvans, who works for a nonprofit that aims to reduce gun violence, said she's seen some police reforms at the local level, pointing to Washington, D.C.'s no-chase law, which prevents unnecessary police car chases.\n\n\"We're trying our best as mothers that's lost our children to gun violence or police brutality to help change a lot of the laws,\" said Evans, whose son PJ was killed in 2021 when he was caught in crossfire.\n\nIn a bipartisan attempt to push reforms. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., recently introduced a bill that would prohibit federal law enforcement and agencies that receive federal funding from executing no-knock warrants. The proposal is named in honor of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in early 2020 by police officers in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment.\n\nAdvocates dedicated to a national policy shift spawned by the Floyd protests said they don't want to give up hope either.\n\nCrudup, the Minneapolis mom of six, believes with enough pressure, the country will pass something akin to the Floyd bill, but that it may sadly take more lives lost at the hands of police.\n\nShe noted the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Roger Fortson, an active-duty senior airman who was killed this month in his apartment by a Florida sheriff's deputy while holding a firearm at his side.\n\n\"And he represented our country,\" Crudup said.\n\n\"Maybe that shooting may reignite the issue (for the Floyd Act),\" she added. \"Heck, name all of the folks who police have killed since Floyd? I guess the sensationalism has waned much faster than most people probably thought it would.\"\n\nSavannah Kuchar contributed to this report."

      "text": "Changing the narrative: How Trump 2.0 is reframing George Floyd and the 2020 protests\n\nHubert Rodell startled his 2-year-old bernedoodle when he leapt from his couch to give Donald Trump a standing ovation during his joint address to Congress this month.\n\nThe president had touted to lawmakers an executive order seeking the death penalty for anyone who kills a police officer , which he asked House and Senate members to put, \"into permanent law.\"\n\nRodell, 69, knows how difficult a job it is keeping a community safe. For nearly two decades his father served as mayor of his hometown , Jonesboro, Arkansas.\n\n\"I know that dad tried his best to give the police as much money as they could get,\" he said.\n\nBut Rodell, a registered Democrat, who supported Trump last fall and would \"vote for him 100 more times, too,\" he said, isn't as enthusiastic about a push by conservative activists to pardon a white Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man, almost five years ago.\n\nThe Bear State native, who retired from the lumber business, remains torn about what unfolded during the May 25, 2020, incident which reminded the country of its racial wounds.\n\n\"It's a two sorted blade,\" Rodell, who is white, told USA TODAY in an interview. \"(Floyd) shouldn't have played so stupid and the police should have stood back and said, 'well, let's listen.' But everybody just got stupid at the same time and they killed the man, then all of a sudden, our cities are burning up everywhere.\"\n\nPart of Trump's campaign last year focused on retribution , and since returning to power, some of the president's allies have tried to recast the 2020 protests in support of Floyd. Millions of people demonstrated in the streets amid a global pandemic to speak out against police violence.\n\nWhether it ' s congressional Republicans pressuring the mayor of D.C. to remove a Black Lives Matter mural down the street from the White House or tech billionaire Elon Musk voicing support to free former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin , who was convicted of killing Floyd, some of the president's supporters are looking for symbolic and substantive ways to change the narrative about the movement that engulfed the nation in 2020.\n\nAs the face of that movement, Floyd's character and actions have long been a focal point of BLM critics, who regularly call out the violence of left-wing groups while seeking to strengthen law enforcement's hand.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with several voters about these moves, and what it could mean for future police reform propoposals that failed during the Biden administration and what's changed about their thinking over time.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes 29 seconds, which gripped the nation's attention in a viral video, some pundits on the right expressed dismay at the officer's actions.\n\nAmong them was Ben Shapiro, founder of the Daily Wire, who at time said \"everyone should be on the same side\" of the issue and that Chauvin should \"go to jail for assault.\" But this month he launched an online petition , arguing the officer had received an unfair trial fueled by protests that led to millions in property damage in some cities and divided the nation.\n\nTrump said he wasn't considering a pardon for Chauvin, who was sentenced to 21 years for depriving Floyd of his federal civil rights in addition to being sentenced to 22 years in prison for second- and third-degree murder in Minnesota.\n\nThe fact that Musk, who works closely with Trump, quickly embraced the idea on X has some of the president's supporters thinking it's worth considering.\n\n\"I don't believe that (Chauvin) should be able to be in a place of authority amongst his peers and his community, but I do believe that he should not have his life stripped away based off of one mistake,\" said Jordyn Joyce, a registered Republican who hails from Ocala, Florida.\n\nJoyce, a physician's assistant, who is white, said what happened to Floyd was tragic. However, she believes Chauvin did what his training called for and she points out that traces of fentanyl were found in Floyd's system.\n\nExpert witnesses said the amount wasn't enough to be considered fatal , but the 28-year-old physician's assistant said it should matter in the context of discussing a potential pardon because drug abuse affects a person's ability to think clearly.\n\n\"It should absolutely play a role to their decision,\" on pardoning Chauvin, she said.\n\nOther voters of different political stripes, however, said the president should think twice about getting involved.\n\nFloyd's background was no reason for him to be killed, said Chris Carson, 52, a former corrections officer who now works as an insurance claims adjuster in Byram, Mississippi.\n\n\"When we handcuffed a person, once you subdue them, you back up off of them, you give them an opportunity,\" said Carson, a Democrat, who is Black.\n\n\"That's the cockiness of some of our law enforcement,\" he added. \"You're not gonna let anybody tell you what to do while you're doing your job, and in this case that particular officer was completely in the wrong.\"\n\nEden Kassa, 37, a government contract from Alexandria, Virginia, said Chauvin's actions were \"irresponsible\" and pardoning him would say you can get away with killing if a powerful person, such as a president or governor, thinks you should.\n\n\"They can exonerate you just because they want to, that's the message that would send to me,\" Kassa, who is Black and a registered Democrat, said.\n\nTrump hasn't shied away from using his executive pen to give out controversial pardons since returning to the White House.\n\nDays after his inauguration, for instance, he pardoned two D.C. police officers who were each convicted and sentenced to multiple years in prison, following their fatal pursuit of Karon Hylton-Brown, a 20-year-old Black man, in 2020 - five months after the murder of Floyd.\n\n52-year-old independent Jedd Smith echoed that Trump shouldn't interfere in the Chauvin case because the officer \"went too far,\" but he is equally critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, which he believes was \"radicalized\" by left-leaning groups.\n\n\"It lost its effectiveness,\" he said.\n\nBut Smith, an engineer who lives in Allegan, Michigan, admits he looks at the issue of police violence a bit differently as a result of Black friends and co-workers who were outspoken about their experiences as the BLM-led demonstrations intensified.\n\n\"I didn't realize how real it was for a Black person that when they see the cops, they're afraid, they're nervous and they're afraid they're going to get hassled,\" said Smith, who voted for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last fall. \"I grew up in white. I didn't realize that it's a very real thing for them, a fear of police, and my growing up, I didn't fear the police.\"\n\nAs jackhammers continue to pound away at removing of the Black Lives Matter mural in Washington, those who hold a negative view of the grassroots groups associated with the mass protests launched in multiple cities during the summer of 2020 say it is about time.\n\nJames Helin, 30, a Navy veteran who lives in Rockingham, North Carolina, said Floyd's death remains a touchy situation, but that he dislikes the BLM movement for \"taking advantage of race relations\" in the country.\n\nHelin said he finds it hard time to believe that racism was as big an issue as it was being made out to be given his personal experience in the military. He said a person's skin color doesn't matter as much as trust, adding he believes many BLM activists tried to \"enrich themselves\" as a result of the racial division.\n\n\"So getting rid of that mural, to me, means trying to put that in the past, and say we don't need people trying to stoke fires. We need people trying to put fires out,\" Helin, a registered independent, who is white, said in an interview.\n\nAmong those who were supportive of the BLM movement there is a slight split, with some arguing the symbols were an empty gesture by Democrats to co-opt its grassroots message for political gain.\n\nJecorey Arthur, a former city councilman in Louisville, Ky., where Breonna Taylor was shot and killed by police weeks before Floyd in 2020, said that he doesn't regret the BLM movement, but thinks it failed to keep momentum after raking in real policy wins locally during that time period.\n\n\"We had demonstration, we had legislation, but I think we lacked organization following those two phases,\" he said. \"We should have been able to sustain those people and go deeper or higher up the ladder of engagement, but that kind of fell apart the further we got away from 2020.\"\n\nArthur, who changed his party registration from Democrat to independent while in office, said removing the mural is largely a symbolic act eclipsed by larger policy attacks, such as targeting diversity and equity programs.\n\nBut for others the mural's public prominence was asserting the value Black life that some activists said was an important demonstration of the country's values.\n\n\"The right has been up in arms for years having conniption fits because Confederate statues were coming down,\" Christi Rangel, 51, a legal secretary and registered independent in Baton Rogue, Louisiana, said. \"So symbols do mean things to people.\"\n\nAs tourists stopped at the intersection of 16th and H in Washington, D.C., where the mural was prominently featured, a couple took a selfie with the White House in the background.

      "text": "Clear Evidence Conservatives are Trying to Erase George Floyd's Death\n\nManage your account\n\nWhen George Floyd was killed at the hands of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin back in May 2020, it became the catalyst for America to pay attention to the plight of Black people in this country. Not only were Black Lives Matter protests taking place on both national and international levels, the federal government and corporate America were finally showing solidarity by implementing intentional diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nChauvin was later convicted for murdering Floyd in 2022 and is serving out concurrent federal and state sentences in a federal prison in Arizona. Considering that Black folks rarely get justice when they lose their lives at the hands of cops, his guilty verdict and sentencing was seen as a rare victory for our community.\n\nBut if Trump and his supporters continue to have their way, all of this progress will be erased. In 2023, the Supreme Court struck down race-conscious college admissions which galvanized conservative groups to go after corporate \"wokeism.\" Since being re-elected, Trump - along with his fellow Republicans- have worked tirelessly to undermine everything accomplished after Floyd's death through a slew of disturbing actions.\n\nTrump wasted no time signing off on executive orders that direct the Attorney General to identify and possibly investigate private sector companies with \" egregious and discriminatory \" DEI programs. The orders also discontinue nearly all DEI-related activities in the federal workforce, in addition to rescinding a number of DEI-related executive orders issued by prior administrations - undoing what was put in place after Floyd's death.\n\nThis has prompted notable companies, including Target, Walmart, Meta, and McDonald's to get rid of their programs that center diversity. It has also led to many executives altering their language around DEI efforts. For example, SHRM (also known as the Society for Human Resource Management) got rid of the word \"equity\" from its \"Inclusion, Equity, and Diversity\" approach, referring to its \"commitment to leading with Inclusion as the catalyst for holistic change in workplaces and society.\"\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that removed a federal system for doing background checks on police. The National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD) was founded in 2023 and contained the professional records of federal law enforcement officers.\n\nIts primary goal was to allow prospective employers - including federal agencies and local police - to check their backgrounds for misconduct. But once Trump was re-elected, he made sure the system was taken offline. After Floyd's death, there was a national outcry for police reform. Former President Joe Biden issued a \"police accountability\" executive order in 2022 with the database being just one item among many in the order. Despite Trump removing it, the National Decertification Index (NDI) still allows departments to check officers' records in other states, NPR reports.\n\nChauvin's conviction in the murder of Floyd felt like justice for Black folks, but that now may be in jeopardy. Conservative media pundit Ben Shapiro recently launched a petition requesting Trump to pardon Chauvin.\n\n\"We write to urge you to immediately issue a pardon for Officer Derek Chauvin, who was unjustly convicted and is currently serving a 22-and-a-half year sentence for the murder of George Floyd and associated federal charges,\" Shapiro wrote in a letter to the president.\n\nBillionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who serves as a senior adviser to Trump - posted about Shapiro's petition on X and stated it was \" something to think about .\"\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram ."

      "text": "Calls to Free George Floyd's Murderer Grow - Here's Why It's Unlikely to Happen\n\nManage your account\n\nAs calls for a pardon for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin are growing in right-wing circles, the real question is it even possible?\n\nThe short answer: not quite.\n\nEarlier this week, right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro urged President Donald Trump to extend clemency for Chauvin's convictions related to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. Less than two months into Trump's second term, he has granted clemency through executive orders more frequently than any other president.\n\nEven if a pardon for his federal conviction was issued, it would not affect Chauvin's murder case because the president has no jurisdiction over state criminal convictions. Trump does have the authority to pardon one of Chauvin's convictions for violating the federal civil rights of Floyd.\n\nDecarceration and legal advocates have expressed concerns to Capital B in previous reporting that Trump's selection process for pardon and commutation recipients from his first term, which includes celebrities and loyalists , could continue - it already has .\n\nFloyd's murder by police sparked a global racial and social justice movement, with weekslong protests erupting in multiple cities. In response, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, then under former President Joe Biden's administration, reopened investigations into the Minneapolis Police Department and other law enforcement agencies accused of misconduct. These investigations, which had been paused during Trump's first term, focused on allegations of systemic civil rights violations.\n\nShapiro, Musk, and other MAGA conservatives have downplayed the role of race in Floyd's death since, dismissing the video evidence and condemning the jury's verdict.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he wasn't considering pardoning Chauvin, multiple news outlets reported . A reporter asked him whether he was considering it, noting, \"your allies are calling on your to pardon Derek Chauvin.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't even heard about it,\" Trump said. \"No. I haven't heard that.\"\n\nKeith Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, pushed back on the calls for a pardon and called it \"blatant disrespect\" for Floyd's family, The Hill reported Thursday .\n\n\"I hope that Donald Trump has enough humanity to recognize that releasing Derek Chauvin would cause untold injury to George Floyd's family and the many, many people that feel vulnerable because they share experiences like the one George Floyd experienced.\"\n\nFloyd's family hasn't released a statement yet. Capital B reached out to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the family, but has not heard back.\n\nAnyone with a federal or state criminal conviction can file a petition for clemency, but only after exhausting all available appeal options. This process can take several years before the appellate process raises to where a state's Supreme Court decides whether to review the case. For state convictions, clemency petitions are typically submitted to the governor or, in some states, the parole board. The president, however, has no jurisdiction over state convictions - presidential clemency, including pardons and commutations, applies only to federal convictions and sentences.\n\nChauvin was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder and other charges and sentenced to 22.5 years in state prison . The former police officer placed his knee on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, causing his death. Three other officers who were present were also convicted and sentenced in federal and state courts.\n\nIn a separate federal case, Chauvin pleaded guilty to violating Floyd's civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old boy in an unrelated 2017 case.\n\nChauvin's federal plea deal resulted in a 21-year sentence, which he is serving concurrently with his state sentence.\n\nIn Chauvin's state case, he would need to appeal to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for a commutation of his sentence for the murder of Floyd. Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, was the running mate of former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris .\n\nA gubernatorial commutation would not erase Chauvin's conviction but could reduce his sentence, potentially to time served. Since his sentencing in June 2021 , Chauvin has been incarcerated in state prison, and any commutation would require approval from the state's Board of Pardons , which includes the governor, the attorney general, and the chief justice of the state's Supreme Court.\n\nMinneapolis became the epicenter of global protests after footage of Floyd's murder went viral. In the aftermath, Walz faced criticism for his handling of police reform efforts in the state. Crump, who represented the families of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor , described Walz as a \"concerned and compassionate leader\" for a grieving community, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn addition, Chauvin's federal plea agreement and sentence covers both Floyd's case and the 2017 case, making it unclear how much of the 21-year sentence applies to each. If Trump were to pardon the Floyd-related conviction, it's uncertain how much time, if any, would be reduced from Chauvin's overall sentence.\n\nA pardon for federal charges in connection with Floyd's death would only be symbolic - Chauvin would still have the federal conviction of depriving the teen of his rights on his record, and he would still have the state murder charges.\n\nOn March 4, Elon Musk reshared a post by Shapiro on his social media platform, X. In a video in the post, Shapiro explains why he thinks Chauvin should be pardoned for convictions related to the murder of Floyd.\n\nShapiro's post reached over 7 million followers and included a link to an online petition calling for Trump to \"immediately issue a pardon.\" Shapiro describes the conviction as \"the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics.\" The petition's campaign description ends by thanking Trump for his \"commitment to ending the weaponization of the American justice system.\"\n\nIf Trump were to pardon Chauvin, his federal conviction would be removed from his criminal record. A presidential pardon would also bypass the standard legal process for seeking clemency, which typically requires incarcerated people like Chauvin to follow the appellate process if new evidence arises that could challenge the fairness of their conviction and then seek clemency.\n\nA long-standing concern in holding police officers accountable is the potential hesitation to bring charges by prosecutors, who may fear a lack of conviction or backlash from the public and law enforcement. This concern could be heightened if a high-profile pardon, such as Chauvin's, were to happen. Moreover, pardoning Chauvin for any of his convictions could create a chilling effect on prosecutors , making them hesitant to pursue charges against law enforcement officers accused of misconduct or violence.\n\nThe post Calls to Free George Floyd's Murderer Grow - Here's Why It's Unlikely to Happen appeared first on Capital B News ."

      "text": "Judge allows testing of tissue samples from George Floyd as officer who killed him seeks new trial\n\nManage your account\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A judge has granted permission to lawyers for Derek Chauvin to have samples from George Floyd examined as part of the former Minneapolis police officer's efforts to challenge his conviction on a federal civil rights charge stemming from Floyd's death in 2020.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson agreed in an order Monday to let the defense examine Floyd's heart tissue and fluid samples to test a theory that Floyd died of a heart condition aggravated by a rare tumor, not - as prosecutors contend - from asphyxiation caused by the white officer pressing his knee on the Black man's neck for 9 1/2 minutes despite Floyd's dying cries of, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nFloyd's death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.\n\nChauvin was convicted in state court on murder charges in 2021 and pleaded guilty later that year in federal court to violating Floyd's civil rights. His federal defender for his appeal attempt, Robert Meyers, argued in his request that Chauvin's original attorney, Eric Nelson, failed to inform his client that an outside pathologist not directly involved in the case, Dr. William Schaetzel, of Topeka, Kansas, had contacted Nelson before Chauvin entered his plea and offered an unsolicited theory that Chauvin did not cause Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin claims that amounted to \"ineffective assistance counsel\" and is seeking a new trial, saying he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known about the pathologist.\n\nBut federal prosecutors have argued in court filings that Nelson made a reasonable \"tactical decision\" not to explore an untested opinion \"offered by someone holding himself out as an expert.\" They pointed out that Nelson consulted with other medical experts in preparation for Chauvin's cases, including one who testified in state court, but that the jury in that case rejected Chauvin's medical defense. They also noted that the legal barriers to succeeding on a claim of ineffective counsel are very high.\n\nNelson declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nChauvin is serving his 20-year federal civil rights and 22 1/2-year state murder sentences concurrently at a federal prison in Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected Chauvin's appeal of his murder conviction."

      "text": "George Floyd's murder led to a national reckoning on policing, but efforts have stalled or reversed\n\nManage your account\n\nFour years ago, protests erupted across the country after millions of Americans watched the chilling video of the murder of George Floyd - a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nIn the aftermath, Chauvin was convicted of murder and calls for a nationwide reckoning on issues related to racism and police violence reverberated in city after city. But in the years since then, some of those efforts at change, like the federal George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, have stalled. In several states, calls to pass criminal justice reforms to address decadeslong racial disparities have stalled or been met with tough-on-crime rhetoric and policies.\n\nFor Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, the initial calls for change after his brother's death were touching.\n\n\"The fact that he was stolen from us. We still can't get over that,\" he said in an interview. \"So many people, they felt the same pain all across the world.\"\n\nBut as he talked about the lack of change and his inability to lobby Congress to pass the federal bill named after his brother, Philonise Floyd broke down in tears.\n\n\"It's different. It is really like you don't have the understanding of how you can sit there and witness that somebody murdered your brother and four years later, it still hasn't been any change,\" he said while weeping. \"You're still trying to pass the same law for your brother. And the city and the world stood with you, and we still haven't gotten, like, any kind of change. What is it going to take?\"\n\nIn recent years, many conservative states - and some progressive parts of the country - have passed tough-on-crime policies.\n\nIn Georgia, lawmakers rolled back 2018 criminal justice reforms, which were supported by Republicans, and added cash bail requirements for 30 new crimes this year. In Tennessee, lawmakers passed a bill to block some reforms related to how police handle traffic stops, including a Memphis law enacted following the killing of Tyre Nichols, a young Black man who died after several police officers violently beat him.\n\nMaryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed into law a controversial juvenile justice bill that allows the state to prosecute children as young as 10 who are accused of serious offenses. Oregon passed a bill recriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs, a move that reverses key parts of an earlier law that did just the opposite.\n\nCritics of tough-on-crime approaches point to Florida as ground zero for the new measures. There, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has championed and signed several bills into law related to police. Those measures include an \"anti-rioting\" law that may curtail protests, which is currently embroiled in a legal challenge at the Florida Supreme Court.\n\n\"We saw really unprecedented disorder and rioting throughout the summer of 2020, and we said that's not going to happen here in the state of Florida,\" DeSantis said before signing the bill into law in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, two other laws - one that limits the power of police civilian review boards in the state, and another that mandates that anyone observing or filming first responders stay 25 feet away when asked - are expected to take effect later this year.\n\nSince his election in 2020, Republican state Rep. Tom Fabricio has supported the measures and said he is serving the will of his constituents.\n\n\"We want to have Florida be a law-and-order state,\" he said. \"We don't want abusive law and order. But we want more law and order, and I believe that's what we've been able to provide to the Florida residents.\"\n\nRepublican state Rep. Alex Rizo sponsored the \"Halo Bill,\" concerning bystanders filming first responders, which is expected to take effect next January.\n\nWhen asked whether the bill was part of the backlash to calls for reform after a bystander's video of Floyd's death emerged, Rizo said it was not and that the bill \"allows for a safe space for the first responder to go ahead and perform their duties.\"\n\n\"The overarching theme and all of these laws that we've passed over the last four years is safety for all Floridians - that includes whether you wear a badge or you don't,\" Rizo said.\n\nThe lawmaker added that civilian review boards across the state should be abolished and that police department oversight be handled by elected officials like city councilors and mayors.\n\n\"You cannot delegate responsibility, and ultimately, the elected leaders, the people that put their name out there and ask for that position, they're the ones that should be held accountable in the end,\" Rizo said.\n\nRodney Jacobs, the executive director of Miami's Civilian Investigative Panel, which oversees independent investigations of police misconduct, vehemently disagrees. He said the work of the panel, which handles some 300 complaints a year, is vital to protecting communities.\n\n\"For so long, people have been asking for police accountability for misconduct,\" he said. \"I think the further we get away from implementing that, the further we get away from having the will to do that constructive work. We will never bridge the gaps between our law enforcement in our community.\"\n\nSome believe that gap was made larger in March when Miami police shot Donald Armstrong after his mother called to get him help during a mental health crisis. Police said Armstrong was waving a sharp object. His lawyer, Larry R. Handfield, said he was holding a small conductor baton. Armstrong is now paralyzed and in jail.\n\nHandfield also told NBC News that he plans to file a civil suit against the city of Miami. But, he said, he also wants to resolve the misdemeanor probation violation charge quickly so Armstrong can get help.\n\nPreston Baldwin, who lived a block away from Armstrong, filmed the shooting and said he is glad he was able to help provide context for what happened. Baldwin said police should have worked harder to de-escalate the incident and not shot Armstrong.\n\n\"I felt like if something was to happen, we would need some unbiased eye,\" he said. \"It's heavy because it's like, dude, it really could be me. Like I could be this guy. It only takes one second to mistake somebody, one second to misconstrue words.\"\n\nBaldwin moved to Miami from Minnesota, where he protested after Floyd's death. Now, he's left wondering what's next.\n\n\"We're kind of like, we're in a circle,\" he said. \"Back to police shootings being the main thing on the news again, you know, people arguing or people not liking each other about race or whatever. We went right back to the same thing that started all this.\"\n\nStill, for Rachel Gilmer, a leader in the Dream Defenders social justice group, the pushback on efforts for change fuels her to keep going.\n\n\"Young people, like our generation, have the most radical, progressive vision for the future of this country,\" she said. \"All of the backlash that we're seeing against that vision also speaks to the power of that vision, and the popularity of that vision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Philonise Floyd and his wife, Keeta, who have started a civil rights organization, now work with many other families affected by police violence. They said they are determined to keep fighting in George Floyd's name as his young daughter, Gianna, grows up without a father.\n\n\"It seems like now everybody's just trying to sweep it under the rug as best we can because we don't talk about it anymore,\" Keeta Floyd said. \"Like, 'Oh, they're not as angry as they used to be.' But we are. We lost George.\"\n\nHer husband echoed those sentiments. \"I'm going to continue to turn my pain into purpose,\" Philonise Floyd said. \"And this bill needs to be passed because my brother's blood is all on this bill. ... At the end of the day, if you want to make change, show it to me.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Now his past cases are under review.\n\nManage your account\n\nFrom her home in Baltimore last year, Tawanda Jones watched police officer Derek Chauvin stand trial in a Minneapolis courtroom for the murder of George Floyd. While the content of the widely televised proceedings in 2021 was disturbing, for Jones the most troubling part was the testimony of expert pathologist Dr. David Fowler.\n\nAppearing on behalf of the officer accused in Floyd's death - documented in the infamous video showing Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck - Fowler testified that the cause of death could not be determined: \"This is one of those cases where you have so many conflicting manners,\" Fowler said. \"So I would fall back to undetermined.\"\n\nFowler testified it was impossible to say what killed Floyd.\n\nJones watched in disbelief. \"I wanted to knock my TV off the wall,\" she said.\n\nJones had seen Fowler sign off on a similar conclusion in the case of her brother, who died in police custody in 2013 in Baltimore after a traffic stop. As Maryland's chief medical examiner for over 17 years before leaving in 2019, Fowler oversaw more than 1,300 cases involving deaths in custody.\n\nOutrage about Fowler's testimony at the Chauvin trial was felt both at home in Maryland and within the medical community. Dr. Roger Mitchell, who was chief medical examiner in Washington, D.C. for seven years, wrote a letter to the Department of Justice and the Maryland Attorney General's office accusing Fowler of \"obvious bias\" and \"malpractice\" in the Floyd case.\n\nMitchell told CBS that he felt compelled to act. \"To have that type of analysis being proffered on the stand, I was appalled,\" he said. \"I knew I had to do something.\"\n\nMitchell called for an independent review of the medical examiner's determinations in 1,300 death in custody cases that occurred during Fowler's 17-year-long tenure in Maryland. More than 400 other medical professionals signed Mitchell's letter.\n\n\"There is a culture of deciding when there is an altercation with law enforcement, that their manners of death are called accidents and undetermined,\" Mitchell explained, adding that prosecutors often won't pursue trying officers in cases where the cause of death was ruled accidental or undetermined.\n\nThose questions have given rise to an unusual - if not unprecedented - review of autopsies in about 100 cases in which people were restrained and died in the custody of police or corrections officials in Maryland. In response to the letter, the Maryland Attorney General's office decided it should take a closer look to make sure the autopsy reports accurately reflected the causes attributed to the hundreds of deaths in police custody during that time period.\n\n\"When you get a letter from 400 experts saying, 'Something's wrong,' there's a pretty good chance that they have something that you should take a hard look at,\" Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said. \"The big question for us was: What happened in Maryland?\"\n\nFowler did not respond to several requests for comment from CBS News. He previously said in a statement that he is \"confident that any fair review will confirm that the Office met or exceeded all applicable professional standards.\"\n\nFrosh has proceeded with an audit of some 1,300 cases, utilizing experts from around the country. That effort has since narrowed to focus on about 100 cases in which someone died while in physical restraint, and the medical examiner's office found the cause of death undetermined. He said when you couple the questions about Fowler's posture on the Floyd case \"with the complaints of families of people who died in police custody saying 'the same thing happened to my kid,' or 'my father,' or 'my brother' ... it becomes obvious that something ought to be looked at.\"\n\nJones believes her brother's case is among the 100 being reviewed, although neither Frosh nor others involved would confirm which cases have been selected. She says the case warrants a review.\n\nWhile chief medical examiner for Maryland, Fowler had signed off on a ruling that the manner of death \"could not be determined\" in her brother's case. Tyrone West  died in July 2013 after a traffic stop resulted in an altercation with police. According to the post-mortem report from Fowler's office, West ended up \"prone on the ground,\" but reportedly continued to resist officers attempts \"to restrain and subdue him with the use of handcuffs and baton strikes.\"\n\nThe struggle continued until West \"suddenly became unresponsive.\"\n\n\"They just said that my brother had some type of health issue and died in police restraint. That was their words. And we're like, 'What health issue? Like, what are you talking about?'\" Jones said. \"They were covering up.\"\n\nJones and her family wanted a second opinion. An autopsy commissioned by the family concluded that her brother died from an officer's knee in his back resulting in positional asphyxia. That's the same way George Floyd died.\n\nNone of the officers in West's case faced criminal charges after an internal investigation cleared them of wrongdoing. In 2014, Jones, on behalf of her brother's estate, filed a wrongful death lawsuit and reached a settlement agreement with the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland. Because the settlement contained a non-disparagement clause, Jones said she removed herself from the case so she could continue to speak out. She told CBS News that she did not financially benefit from the agreement, but the money from the settlement went to West's children.\n\nFrosh, who is leaving office in January, would not confirm whether West's case was among those being reviewed, but West's sister remains hopeful that he will not be forgotten. Frosh said his reason for not confirming the names associated with cases under review is that the process must remain uninfluenced by grieving families or police officers. If any errors are found in those post mortem rulings, officers involved in those cases could be subject to criminal charges.\n\nFrosh's successor, Congressman Anthony Brown, will take over as attorney general in January. He declined a request from CBS News to comment on the ongoing review.\n\nO.J.

      "text": "George Floyd: What happened in the final moments of his life\n\nThe US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\n\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor.\n\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\n\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers.\n\nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.\n\nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill.\n\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\n\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.\n\nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC .\n\nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\n\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but \"he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that\", according to a transcript released by authorities .\n\nThe employee said the man appeared \"drunk\" and \"not in control of himself\", the transcript says.\n\nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\n\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident , prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\n\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, \"put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car\". Then Mr Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed\".\n\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for \"passing counterfeit currency\".\n\nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\n\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\n\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.\n\nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd \"stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic\", according to the report.\n\nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\n\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.\n\nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\n\nThat's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last.\n\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\n\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.\n\nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\n\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: \"You're going to kill me, man.\"\n\nOfficer Chauvin replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\n\nMr Floyd says: \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\"\n\nA female bystander told the police: \"His nose is bleeding, come on now.\"\n\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\n\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but \"couldn't find one\". Yet the other officers did not move.\n\nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.\n\nHe was pronounced dead about an hour later.\n\nOn the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\n\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\n\"The way he died was senseless,\" Harris said. \"He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.\"\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Who was George Floyd and what happened to Derek Chauvin?\n\nA year has passed since George Floyd - an unarmed African American man - was murdered during an arrest by white officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nVideos of the incident - which showed Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes - triggered protests across the US and around the world over police brutality and racism in law enforcement.\n\nThe 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020.\n\nA shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 bill and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to return the cigarettes or pay again.\n\nOfficers arrived and handcuffed him but when they tried to put him into the squad car, he resisted. A struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street.\n\nThat's when onlookers began filming.\n\nChauvin, 44, placed his left knee on Mr Floyd's neck and shoulder, and kept it there for more than nine minutes, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening.\n\nMore than 20 times Mr Floyd said he could not breathe. The video shows him going limp and being carried away by police.\n\nHe was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.\n\nChauvin was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest and faced the most serious charges of the four.\n\nThe 19-year Minneapolis Police Department veteran's record of policing included both commendations and complaints about conduct.\n\nIn 2006, Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.\n\nThere were at least 15 conduct complaints against him prior to the killing of Mr Floyd. Most were closed without discipline.\n\nThe day after his arrest, a lawyer for his wife Kellie said she had filed for divorce.\n\nThe highly-charged trial, which began on 29 March, lasted three weeks and left Minneapolis on edge.\n\nA twelve-member jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling \"helpless\" as events unfolded.\n\nMr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand.\n\nExpert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues.\n\nChauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses.\n\nJurors took less than a day to reach their unanimous verdict, finding Chauvin guilty on all three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.\n\nSentencing will take place in June, and Mr Chauvin could spend decades in jail.\n\nHis lawyers have requested a new trial, but the motion is not likely to be granted.\n\nThe other three police officers will come before the courts in August.\n\nThe four police officers at the scene were fired the following day, as crowds took to the streets of Minneapolis to protest.\n\nThe station where they worked was set ablaze and demonstrations quickly spread to other cities.\n\nBy the sixth night, there were protests in 75 cities across the US - some violent - and a national debate about police brutality against African-Americans was reignited.\n\nAn anti-racism movement created in 2013 after the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, Black Lives Matter, was re-energised.\n\nEven very white, small towns in rural parts of the US held protests to remember Mr Floyd and take a stand against racial injustice.\n\nReforms were introduced by lawmakers to change the way some police forces make arrests and detain suspects.\n\nBut the conversation soon widened from policing to issues such as workplace equality, unconscious bias and the legacy of slavery.\n\nAfter the verdict, the Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said the conviction marked a \"turning point in history\" for the US.\n\nIt is rare that police officers in the US are charged, let alone convicted, for use of lethal force.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict. Mr Biden was heard saying that \"at least now there is some justice\".\n\nIn nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: \"Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul.\"\n\nAnti-racism protests were held in countries across the world in response to the death.\n\nMany focused on their own victims of alleged police violence.\n\nIn Australia, the focus was on the indigenous community, while in the UK, a statue of a 17th Century slave trader was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour.\n\nMany corporate brands also expressed support for Black Lives Matter, while many athletes now \"take the knee\" in solidarity before events.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "George Floyd: Five pieces of context to understand the protests\n\nFor more than a week, protests have shaken cities across the US following the death of a black man in police custody.\n\nGeorge Floyd, 46, was arrested in the city of Minneapolis on 25 May for allegedly using counterfeit money to buy a pack of cigarettes. He died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, while he pleaded that he could not breathe.\n\nThe officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been dismissed from the police department and charged with murder. Three other officers who were on the scene were also sacked and later charged with abetting the crime.\n\nUnrest has broken out across the country. Police have used tear gas and force against demonstrators and President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military.\n\nHere, we look at some of the context that will help you understand the fuller picture of what is happening.\n\nThere are numerous recent examples of African-American people being killed by law enforcement officers in the US.\n\nHigh-profile cases from recent years include Philando Castile , Terence Crutcher , Michael Brown and Alton Sterling . In these cases the officers involved were not convicted of any criminal offence.\n\n\"I'm tired of hearing about black people dying,\" one protester in Washington DC said. \"I'm tired of being afraid just by being stopped by the cops.\"\n\nIn particular, the George Floyd case has drawn comparisons with the death of Eric Garner in July 2014.\n\nGarner, a 43-year-old father of six, was arrested in New York on suspicion of illegally selling loose cigarettes. In a video recorded by a bystander, white police officer Daniel Pantaleo can be seen with his arm wrapped around Garner's neck in a chokehold.\n\nGarner, an asthmatic, was heard repeatedly saying \"I can't breathe\" before appearing to lose consciousness. He was later pronounced dead in hospital.\n\nA state grand jury declined to charge the officer with murder.\n\nThe case sparked nationwide protests, but the officer never faced any criminal charges and lost his job in 2019 - five years after Garner's death .\n\nIn the case of George Floyd, the speed with which the officers involved were fired, and with which Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged, was unusual.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama said the protests over Floyd's death represented a \"genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system.\"\n\nData collated by the BBC's Reality Check team highlights how the experience of African Americans differs from white Americans when it comes to law and order.\n\nIn 2019, African Americans made up less than 14% of the population but accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police.\n\nAfrican Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans even though surveys show drug use at similar levels for both groups.\n\nIn 2018, African Americans represented almost a third of the country's prison population.\n\nThis means there are more than 1,000 African-American inmates in federal or state prisons for every 100,000 African Americans, while there are about 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans.\n\nData from Minneapolis, where Floyd lived, also reflect these law enforcement trends.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death did not happen in a vacuum. It came on the heels of several other high-profile incidents just in the past few weeks that have provoked debates about racism in the country.\n\nOn the same day as his death, a video went viral of a white woman in New York's Central Park calling the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a lead .\n\nAn exchange between the two started because Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, was concerned that the dog could endanger wildlife. He filmed Amy Cooper (no relation) threatening to call the police and tell them \"there's an African-American man threatening my life\".\n\nAfter calling the emergency operator she repeated, \"He's African American,\" before pleading for them to send an officer.\n\nMs Cooper was fired from her job and widely condemned.\n\nIn a later interview with NBC News, Mr Cooper raised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February. A third man filmed the shooting.\n\nThe case gained widespread attention in the national media and provoked outrage.\n\nIt took more than two months for the suspects to be charged .\n\n\"We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that,\" Mr Cooper said.\n\nRacial divisions in US society are also prevalent in areas such as housing, healthcare and employment.\n\nIn 2016, the typical net worth of a white family was found to be nearly 10 times greater than that of a black family . Compared with white Americans, African Americans are almost twice as likely not to have medical insurance .\n\nAfrican Americans are more likely to work in service industry jobs and to live in densely populated areas.\n\nThese issues have all contributed to African Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which is happening at the same time as the Floyd protests. George Floyd's autopsy concluded he had coronavirus, although this played no part in his death.\n\nAccording to the most recent government data more than 34% of those in hospital with coronavirus are black , out of 19,775 cases where race and ethnicity data were available.\n\nNew York City has reported that rates of Covid-19 deaths are substantially higher among African Americans than white Americans.\n\nRates of unemployment during the pandemic, as before, are also higher among African Americans than white Americans . George Floyd lost his job as a bouncer as a result of the coronavirus shutdown.\n\n\"The coronavirus does not discriminate, but our housing, economic, and health care policies do,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.\n\n\"Environmental racism, unaffordable housing, a lack of job opportunities, poverty, and inadequate health care are underlying social conditions, strongly influenced by policy, which place black people and their neighbourhoods at risk.\"\n\nSuch socio-economic inequality also exists in Minneapolis - the city where Floyd died and where the protests began.\n\nMinneapolis has a population of about 430,000 people, less than 20% of whom are black.\n\nEven before layoffs caused by the pandemic, 10% of black residents of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul were unemployed compared with 4% of whites.\n\nIn 2016, 32% of black people living there fell below the poverty line compared with 6.5% of whites.\n\nNeighbourhoods there are highly segregated and black home ownership is among the lowest in the country.\n\n\"The same attitudes that led a cop to kneel in the back of a black man's neck, choking him out are the same attitudes held by people in housing markets who facilitate the region's black-white homeownership gap of 46% to 79%,\" said Mr Perry.\n\nDonald Trump's presidency began with massive, nationwide protests. Now, it could be ending with them.\n\nThe women's marches of January 2017 brought hundreds of thousands to US streets for largely peaceful demonstrations. Following George Floyd's death, the protests in the nation's capital, and across the country, have at times turned violent. And while the 2017 events were in direct reaction to Trump's inauguration, the purpose of latest uprising - addressing racial injustice and policing practices - are not specifically about the president.\n\nThe president has taken the demonstrations personally, however. Like the women's marches, his actions suggest he views the Floyd marches as an attempt to undermine his presidency. The first set the stage for his administration, and these latest come just five months before he hopes to be re-elected to a second four-year term.\n\nThe politics of the situation has clearly influenced the tenor of his response. He echoed a pledge to restore \"law and order\" that Richard Nixon used successfully in his 1968 and 1972 presidential victories. Trump's controversial decision to clear protesters and stand for photographs with a Bible in front of a church near the White House hints at a desire to court the evangelical voters he needs in November.\n\nAlthough the root causes of the Floyd protests predate the Trump presidency, the president - by his words and actions, intentional or not - have added fuel the storm.\n\nThe protests over George Floyd's death have drawn attention to the use of military equipment by police officers. While images of military vehicles being used for crowd control may appear shocking to some, it is not a new phenomenon in the US.\n\nThe Department of Defense began a programme in the 1990s allowing the transfer of excess military equipment to police departments. Preference is meant to be given to anti-drug and counter-terror needs.\n\nToday more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate in the programme .\n\nIt is overseen by the Defense Logistics Agency, which has the final authority over the type and quantity of equipment made available to different agencies. It does not specify how such equipment should be used.\n\nData show that surplus military equipment transferred to local law enforcement agencies under the 1033 programme has been rising since the mid-2000s, with spikes after 2010.\n\nAs of 2015, more than $5bn worth of military equipment had been distributed to law enforcement agencies under the programme.\n\nPaul Poast, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said prior to the mid-2000s much US military equipment was \"simply not as usable for law enforcement\".\n\n\"With the start of counter-insurgency fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, manufacturers began to develop weapons that one could say had more 'dual-use': be usable in urban counter-insurgency environments and usable by urban law enforcement.\n\n\"The surge starting in the 2010s can be explained by both the popularity of the equipment and the beginning of drawing down troops in Iraq. With less need for such equipment in Iraq, the equipment needed to go somewhere,\" he said.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama barred the military from handing over some types of equipment after criticism that police were too heavy-handed in dealing with protests in Ferguson, Missouri , that followed the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in 2014.\n\nBut Mr Trump lifted the restrictions in 2017 .\n\nEquipment given out under the programme includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and bullet-proof helmets.\n\nMr Poast said the use of military equipment by police was a key example of how large-scale counter-insurgency campaigns abroad can influence domestic security policy.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "George Floyd, the man whose death sparked US unrest\n\nBefore the image of George Floyd lying under the knee of a policeman set off shock, anger and protests across the US, the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs.\n\nThere were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions.\n\nThere were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison.\n\nBut mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges.\n\nHis death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020.\n\nA native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre.\n\nBeyoncé grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have 'spit bars' as part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston.\n\nBut poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing.\n\n\"Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this.\n\n\"It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'\" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC.\n\n\"People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape,\" says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile.\n\nFloyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. \"Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy.\"\n\nGrowing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a \"gentle giant\" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football.\n\n\"I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two,\" Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. \"I had never seen anyone that tall before\".\n\nAt John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN.\n\nHe returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree.\n\nHis life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nHe became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard.\n\n\"While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community.\"\n\nA video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to \"come home\".\n\nHis family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme.\n\nChristopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd \"was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning\".\n\n\"He was happy with the change he was making,\" he added.\n\nThe former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as \"Big Floyd.\"\n\nLike many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nOn the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nAnger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence.\n\nOver 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states.\n\nMr Lillard, who described his friend as a \"person of peace\", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence.\n\n\"He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too,\" he said. \"Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting.\"\n\n\"I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd,\" he added, speaking of the protests. \"I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself].\"\n\nWigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.\n\nResearch suggests the synthetic hair used for braiding could be bad for you - but will that stop women using it?\n\n\"You can dig up concrete but you cannot erase history,\" said one resident of the capital.\n\nDonald Trump has scrapped federal diversity initiatives and many US firms have too - will UK companies follow suit?\n\nThe proportion of people in Thurrock who were not born in the UK has nearly doubled.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "George Floyd: Timeline of black deaths and protests\n\nHere's a timeline of major incidents since 2014 involving police officers which resulted in the deaths of black Americans.\n\nEric Garner died after he was wrestled to the ground by a New York police officer on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes.\n\nWhile in a choke hold, Mr Garner uttered the words \"I can't breathe\" 11 times.\n\nThe incident - filmed by a bystander - led to protests across the country. The police officer involved was later fired, but was never prosecuted.\n\nIt came a year after the Black Lives Matter movement emerged in response to the acquittal of the man who killed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nMichael Brown, 18, was killed by a police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri, who was responding to reports that Brown had stolen a box of cigars.\n\nThe officer, Darren Wilson, stopped his car in front of Brown.\n\nBrown reached into the car and punched Wilson, and in the struggle that followed, he tried to grab the police officer's gun, according to a report by the Department of Justice (DOJ), which was based on forensic evidence and interviews with dozens of witnesses.\n\nOne shot was fired and Brown ran off, pursued by Wilson. When he turned back and moved towards Wilson, the fatal shots were fired, according to witnesses.\n\nAlthough the police officer was cleared of wrongdoing, the DOJ report was scathing about systemic problems in the Ferguson police and racial disparities in the justice system.\n\nThe incident led to multiple waves of protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, boosting the Black Lives Matter movement further.\n\nTamir Rice, a boy of 12, was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio by a police officer after reports of a male who was \"probably a juvenile\" pointing a gun that was \"probably fake\" at passers by.\n\nPolice claimed that they told Rice to drop the weapon - but instead of dropping it he pointed it at police.\n\nThe police confirmed that the gun was a toy after Rice had been shot dead.\n\nThe police officer who fired the fatal shots was sacked three years later for lying on his job application form.\n\nIn December 2020, the Justice Department said it was closing its investigation into the case as there was not enough evidence to bring federal criminal charges.\n\nWalter Scott was shot in the back five times by a white police officer, who was later fired and eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nMr Scott had been pulled over for having a defective light on his car in North Charleston, South Carolina, and ran away from the police officer after a brief scuffle.\n\nThe killing sparked protests in North Charleston, with chants of \"No justice, no peace\".\n\nAlton Sterling's death led to days of protests in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr Sterling was killed after police responded to reports of a disturbance outside a shop.\n\nThe incident was caught on mobile phone footage and spread online.\n\nThe two officers involved did not face criminal charges, but one was dismissed and the other suspended from the police.\n\nPhilando Castile was killed while out driving with his girlfriend in St Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHe was pulled over by the police during a routine check, and told them he was licensed to carry a weapon, and had one in his possession.\n\nHe was shot as he was reaching for his licence, according to his girlfriend.\n\nShe live-streamed the encounter on Facebook. The officer involved was cleared of murder charges.\n\nStephon Clark died after being shot at least seven times in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento, California, by police who were investigating a nearby break-in.\n\nOnly a mobile phone was found at the scene, and Mr Clark was unarmed.\n\nThe release of a police video of the incident sparked major protests in the city.\n\nIn March 2019, the authorities announced that the two officers involved would not face criminal prosecution as the officers had feared for their lives, believing Mr Clark had a gun.\n\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was shot eight times when officers raided her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nLouisville police said they returned fire after one officer was shot at and wounded.\n\nBreonna Taylor's family filed a lawsuit, and in September 2020 reached a settlement of $12m (£9.4m) with the city authorities.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that Ms Taylor's partner - who was with her at the time -  had fired in self-defence because the police did not identify themselves, and he thought the apartment was being burgled.\n\nA grand jury charged one police officer not with Ms Taylor's death, but with \"wanton endangerment\" for firing into a neighbouring apartment.\n\nThree officers involved in the raid have now been dismissed from the police force.\n\nGeorge Floyd died after being arrested in Minneapolis and held down by police officers, one of whom had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.\n\nHe pleaded that he couldn't breathe, and after his death, protests broke out across the US, and there were demonstrations in other parts of the world.\n\nFormer police officer Derek Chauvin - who had knelt on Mr Floyd - was convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after a three-week trial.\n\nThree other officers who were involved in the incident will be tried later this year accused of aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin.\n\nDaunte Wright was shot and killed in Brooklyn Center, just north of Minneapolis.\n\nAfter being pulled over for a traffic violation, the police told Mr Wright he was being arrested for an outstanding  warrant.\n\nHe broke free and tried to re-enter his car, at which point an officer is heard shouting \"Taser\" several times before firing a shot.\n\nLocal police said the killing appeared to be accidental, and the officer, Kim Potter, had meant to use her Taser and not her handgun.\n\nThe family has rejected that explanation, and protests over the shooting have continued.\n\nMrs Potter has resigned from the police, and been charged with second-degree manslaughter.\n\n\"You can dig up concrete but you cannot erase history,\" said one resident of the capital.\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón sparked controversy over old social media posts about Islam, George Floyd and the Oscars.\n\nThe department began investigating police in the Tennessee city after the 2023 death of Tyre Nichols.\n\nFormer officer Adam Coy shot and killed Andre Hill as he walked out of a garage in 2020.\n\nBut all three were cleared of the most serious counts that could have resulted in life in prison for the death of Tyre Nichols.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "George Floyd: Federal civil rights trial of three ex-officers begins\n\nA federal civil rights trial for three US ex-police officers indicted in the murder of George Floyd has begun in Minneapolis.\n\nJ Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao helped senior officer Derek Chauvin detain Mr Floyd for allegedly handing a counterfeit bill.\n\nChauvin was filmed pressing his knee into the unarmed black man's neck for more than nine minutes before he died.\n\nHis death, filmed by a bystander, led to global protests in 2020.\n\nChauvin was convicted last June of murder and is currently serving time in state prison. In December, he pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating Mr Floyd's civil rights, averting a second trial.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege the officers \"wilfully deprived\" Mr Floyd of his civil liberties during the attempted arrest and have submitted a list of 48 witnesses they could call to the stand.\n\nJury selection was completed in a single day on Thursday. The court expects to begin opening arguments next Monday with a full bench of 12 jurors and six alternates.\n\nTwo of the selected jurors appear to be Asian and the others are white, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune newspaper . The selected jury are composed of five men and seven women.\n\nJudge Paul Magnuson questioned one juror on whether his daughter's involvement in protests in the wake of Mr Floyd's death would allow him to remain impartial. When the man said it would not affect his judgement, the judge responded that his granddaughter also \"kind of got caught\" up in the same thing, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe three men will also face their own state charges - for aiding and abetting Chauvin - in a separate trial later this year.\n\nHere is what we know about the four former police officers and the charges they face.\n\nWhat was his role?\n\nMr Lane, 38, was one of the first two officers called to the shop reporting a counterfeit $20 bill. At the scene, he approached Mr Floyd's car, pointed his gun at him and handcuffed him. He later allegedly held a struggling Mr Floyd's feet as Chauvin and Mr Kueng restrained him on the ground.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nHe has been charged with one count of depriving Mr Floyd of his civil rights using \"the colour of the law\", including that he ignored the arrestee's \"right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs\".\n\nWhat's his background?\n\nMr Lane became a cadet at the police department in February 2019, but started working for the force just four days prior to Mr Floyd's death.\n\nHis training officer was Chauvin. A criminal complaint against Mr Lane claims he questioned Chauvin's tactics during the arrest of Mr Floyd, asking: \"Should we roll him on his side?\"\n\nThe ex-officer had no track record of complaints.\n\nA criminology graduate from the University of Minnesota, Mr Lane used to work as a guard at a juvenile detention centre and volunteered to mentor Somali school children.\n\nWhat was his role?\n\nMr Kueng, 27, was first on the scene with Mr Lane. He helped Chauvin and Mr Lane pin Mr Floyd to the floor. He was also the first to find Mr Floyd no longer had a pulse.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nHe faces two counts of using \"the colour of the law\" to deprive Mr Floyd of his civil rights, including that he \"wilfully failed to intervene\" to stop Chauvin using his knee on the arrestee's neck.\n\nWhat's his background?\n\nLike Mr Lane, Mr Kueng was relatively new to policing, entering the force in Minneapolis in February 2019 as a cadet.\n\nAccording to a New York Times profile , Mr Kueng - whose mother is white and father is Nigerian - believed \"diversity could force change in a Police Department long accused of racism\".\n\nHe and Mr Lane graduated in the same recruit class and were promoted to officers in December 2019, with Chauvin as their field training officer. There were no previous complaints against him.\n\nThe death of Mr Floyd happened on his third shift.\n\nMr Kueng, who also speaks Russian, attended the University of Minnesota, where he studied sociology.\n\nWhat was his role?\n\nMr Thao, 35, stood near the other three officers while they restrained Mr Floyd. He stood between the officers and bystanders, telling the growing crowd to keep its distance.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nHe also faces two counts of using \"the colour of the law\" to deprive Mr Floyd of his civil rights.\n\nWhat's his background?\n\nMr Thao - a Hmong American - completed his police academy training in 2009 but was laid off when the force made budget cuts. He re-joined as an officer in 2012.\n\nUp to his sacking, Mr Thao had six conduct complaints on his record. Five were closed without discipline and one was open at the time of his firing, but no details have been made public about any of the complaints.\n\nFood service and security are among the sectors Mr Thao previously worked in.\n\nWhat was his role?\n\nChauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was handcuffed on the floor repeatedly pleading \"I can't breathe\".\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nChauvin was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was convicted on all three counts and was sentenced last June to 22-and-a-half years in state prison. He is appealing his state murder conviction.\n\nIn December 2021, he pleaded guilty to federal civil rights charges stemming from the Floyd incident and an unrelated 2017 case of unreasonable force. Federal prosecutors have recommended a 25-year sentence.\n\nWhat's his background?\n\nChauvin was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest, serving for almost 19 years with the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nRecords from the Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affairs Division reportedly show at least 15 conduct complaints against him. Most were closed without disciplinary action.\n\nIn 2006, Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.\n\nPrior to his career in the police, Chauvin served two stints in the US Army, as a member of the military police.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "George Floyd murder: Derek Chauvin sentenced to over 22 years\n\nThe US white ex-police officer convicted of murdering African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 has been sentenced to 22 years and six months in jail.\n\nThe judge said Derek Chauvin's sentence was based \"on your abuse of a position of trust and authority, and also the particular cruelty shown\" to Mr Floyd.\n\nMr Floyd, 48, died after Chauvin knelt on his neck for nine minutes.\n\nHis murder caused global protests against racism and police brutality.\n\nChauvin, 45, was convicted of second-degree murder and other charges last month. During his trial, his lawyer described the killing as \"an error made in good faith\".\n\nChauvin was also told to register as a predatory offender and was barred from owning firearms for life.\n\nHe and three other former officers are separately charged with violating George Floyd's civil rights .\n\nThe Floyd family and their supporters welcomed the sentence.\n\n\"This historic sentence brings the Floyd family and our nation one step closer to healing by delivering closure and accountability,\" lawyer Ben Crump tweeted.\n\nMr Floyd's sister Bridgett Floyd said the sentence \"shows that matters of police brutality are finally being taken seriously\" but there was still \"a long way to go\".\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the sentence \"seemed to be appropriate\" but admitted that he did not know all the details.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Mr Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd demanded the maximum available, a sentence of 40 years.\n\n\"Why? What were you thinking? What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brother's neck?\" he said.\n\nMr Floyd's daughter Gianna, aged seven, appeared in a video recording, saying she missed him and she loved him.\n\n\"I ask about him all the time,\" she said. \"My daddy always used to help me brush my teeth.\"\n\nThe judge said the case had been painful for the community and the country, but above all, for Mr Floyd's family.\n\n\"What the sentence is not based on is emotion, or sympathy, but at the same time, I want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family,\" said Judge Peter Cahill.\n\nChauvin told the court he offered his condolences to the Floyd family, saying there would be \"some other information in the future\" and he hoped \"things will give you some peace of mind\".\n\nHowever, he did not apologise.\n\nIn court, Chauvin's mother said he was a \"good man\".\n\n\"I have always believed in your innocence and I will never waver from that,\" said Carolyn Pawlenty.\n\nChauvin's sentence was \"one of the longest a former police officer has ever received\" for deadly force, said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\nHe bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit note and called police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight.\n\nChauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.\n\nAs he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging \"please, please, please\".\n\nWhen the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later.\n\nHis death was filmed by Darnella Frazier , now 18, who was out walking with her cousin when she saw his arrest.\n\nShe said she had begun recording the incident on her phone because \"I saw a man terrified, begging for his life\".\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Frazier was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize, the most prestigious award in American journalism.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The white former officer will be sentenced next month and faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nAccording to a Department of Justice statement , four officers - Alexander Keung, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, as well as Chauvin - are accused of infringing Mr Floyd's civil rights.\n\nCount one alleges that when Chauvin knelt on Mr Floyd he broke his \"constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer\".\n\nThe second count accuses Mr Keung and Mr Thao of failing to intervene that day, while the third count alleges that all four \"saw Mr Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care\" and failed to help him.\n\nChauvin has also been charged with two charges for an incident in September 2017, the statement said.\n\nThe former police officer is accused of holding a 14-year-old by the throat and hitting him \"multiple times in the head\", as well as allegedly kneeling on his neck and upper back \"after the teenager was lying prone, handcuffed, and unresisting\".\n\nAll the federal charges revealed on Friday are separate to those filed against the four officers by the state of Minnesota.\n\nMr Kueng, Mr Lane, and Mr Thao are due to stand trial together later this year over Mr Floyd's death.\n\nThe 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in May 2020.

I was watching on my phone and I just kept thinking 'why is he on him, there's no need for this'.\n\nThere was no need for that amount of force, she says.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Watching my wife's reaction, she was saying the same thing the rest of the world was saying. Why, just why?\"\n\nBrittany takes me out on patrol with her. Ferguson isn't very big - typical smalltown America.  Easy on the eye.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that on television this place looked like a war zone,\" I suggest, gazing out of the window from the passenger seat at little white picket fences and manicured lawns.\n\n\"Yeah that was a lot of trouble that went on for weeks.\"\n\nShe's referring to the nightly pictures beamed around the world of the running battles between riot police and protestors in 2014, following the killing of the African American teenager, Michael Brown, who was shot six times by a white police officer.\n\nPictures show his body lying in the middle of the road in a pool of blood. His sneakered feet poking out from beneath a white blanket.\n\n\"I'd been a police officer for about five years up to that point, and looking at Facebook isn't a good idea, when there's been a police killing\" Brittany shrugs.\n\n\"It was the same after George Floyd died. You see comments like - all the police want to do is kill us. But that's not what it's about, being a police officer.\"\n\nUp ahead, we see a liquor store on the corner of the street.\n\n\"Watch this,\" Brittany says, \"you see those five cars parked outside, as soon as we pull up, they'll drive off.\"\n\nSure enough, that's what happens, the vehicles scatter on the arrival of the patrol car.\n\n\"The drunks don't like me hanging around,\" she says \"in case they do something stupid. But I worry every day that someone will pull out a knife or a gun and I won't go home back to my kids and my family at night.\"\n\n\"Do you pray before you go to work?\" I ask. \"Yes, every day. I pray outside the room of my kids that they'll be safe, and to make sure they know they're loved, and I pray I return home to them.\"\n\nThe death of Michael Brown was investigated by President Barack Obama's Department of Justice and they cleared the police officer of wrongdoing on the basis of witness statements and forensic evidence.\n\nBut it was scathing about the Ferguson Police Department and its report led to the resignation of the police chief. To this day the force must adhere to a strict set of rules governing how it conducts its business.\n\nThe current Ferguson police chief, Jason Armstrong, has been in the job for two years, trying to maintain a steady course on the road to the force's redemption.\n\n\"We're doing what we can,\" he says. I cannot guarantee or promise you there won't be another police shooting, of course not, but what I can promise and guarantee, is that we are going to handle that problem the right way, that there will be accountability. Only time can build trust, but we're getting there.\"\n\nBut what about the fabled \"blue wall of silence\", that unbreakable bond between cops? It used to mean your buddy's got your back in a shoot-out, but it also meant he or she had your back if you did something stupid, or wrong, or even illegal. In other words, they'd lie to cover for you.\n\n\"We have new disciplinary procedures,\" says Chief Armstrong. \"Our Duty to Report policy means that if an officer sees a colleague engaged in activity that would discredit the force, then they're duty bound to report what happened, and failing to do so could result in penalties similar to those imposed for committing the offence itself. \"\n\nIt is a long road to the atonement past police injustices require. But Chief Armstrong says there hasn't been a single police shooting in Ferguson since Michael Brown died. No officer has had to discharge their weapon.\n\nThe chief was taking part in a fun run on the day I arrived in St Louis, jogging alongside local people. A different kind of community policing on a sunny Saturday afternoon.  No big deal, no great fanfare, but the visible manifestation of a sense of community the police department is trying to foster.\n\nThe town sits next to the city of St Louis, the US murder capital and the worst place in America for civilian deaths at the hands of the police. I meet patrol officer Jay Schroeder, in the bar of the St Louis Police Officer's Association.\n\nHe's the president, and on the walls in four large frames are passport style pictures of 166 St Louis police officers. Each one is dated, the first in grainy black and white is of a man called John Sturdy. Beneath his name are the letters EOW, which stand for End of Watch, and the date he died - 1863.\n\nJay says several of the officers whose pictures are on the wall died in the late 19th, and early 20th Century and were victims of electrocution, after trying to use the cast iron police call boxes, which were poorly designed. But many others were shot in the line of duty.\n\n\"That's Gregory Erson,\" he says looking at one photograph, this time in colour. \"He was working in vice and was ambushed by a prostitute's pimp. EOW-1983.\n\n\"Four of these guys I worked with, and Norvelle Brown- EOW August 2007, was the first who was shot and killed. Murdered after being fired on from inside a house where he was attending an incident. He didn't stand a chance.\"\n\nI gently make the point to Jay that the city of St Louis has the highest level of civilian deaths at the hands of the police, anywhere in America.\n\n\"Yes but it is a dangerous place with violent crime rising,\" he counters.  \"But we understand public concern and we've been trying to work better with local communities, and we were doing good. Then George Floyd happened, and that set law enforcement back across this country. Sometimes things look bad on video. This one was bad, and for all the progress we've made since Ferguson, it wiped it out, just like that.\"\n\nJay comes from a family of police officers, six generations to be exact. His great, great, great, great, great grandfather emigrated from Ireland to America in 1891 and joined the police force, and there's been an officer from the Schroeder family in the ranks continuously, ever since.\n\nAs America marks the one year anniversary of George Floyd's death, it's not just civilians who'll be reflecting on what happened.\n\nThe police will be too, determined to show that Derek Chauvin does not represent who they are.\n\n\"You can dig up concrete but you cannot erase history,\" said one resident of the capital.\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón sparked controversy over old social media posts about Islam, George Floyd and the Oscars.\n\nThe department began investigating police in the Tennessee city after the 2023 death of Tyre Nichols.\n\nFormer officer Adam Coy shot and killed Andre Hill as he walked out of a garage in 2020.\n\nBrett Hankison is the first officer convicted in the 2020 botched raid on Taylor's apartment\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The three officers will face additional state charges in June.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 25, 2022, 1:04 p.m. ET | St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe three Minneapolis police officers alongside Derek Chauvin at the scene of George Floyd's killing offered a variety of reasons why they weren't to blame: Inexperience. Bad training. Fear of a senior officer. The looming threat of angry bystanders.\n\nA federal jury swept them all aside Thursday, emerging from two days of deliberations that followed a month of testimony to convict Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Lane of violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nAll three men were convicted of depriving Mr. Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under Mr. Chauvin's knee for 9 1/2 minutes while handcuffed, facedown on the street on May 25, 2020. Mr. Kueng knelt on Mr. Floyd's back, Mr. Lane held his legs, and Mr. Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMr. Thao and Mr. Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop Mr. Chauvin in the videotaped killing that sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the globe as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nMr. Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd called the verdicts \"accountability,\" but added: \"There can never be justice because I can never get George back.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said he hoped the verdicts would change laws and policies to \"protect people from these situations.\" He also said the outcome \"sends a message that says, if you murder or use excessive or deadly force, there's consequences that follow.\"\n\nMr. Lane shook his head and looked at his attorney as his verdict was read. Mr. Thao and Mr. Kueng showed no visible emotion. Their attorneys declined to comment immediately afterward.\n\nCharles Kovats, acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, called the convictions a reminder that all sworn law enforcement officers have a duty to intervene.\n\n\"These officers had a moral responsibility, a legal obligation, and a duty to intervene, and by failing to do so, they committed a crime,\" Mr. Kovats said.\n\nMr. Chauvin and Mr. Thao went to the scene to help rookies Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane after they responded to a call that Mr. Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. Mr. Floyd struggled with officers as they tried to put him in a police SUV.\n\nDuring the monthlong federal trial, prosecutors sought to show that the officers violated their training, including when they failed to move Mr. Floyd or give him CPR. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Floyd's condition was so serious that even bystanders without basic medical training could see he needed help, but that the officers \"chose to do nothing.\"\n\nThe defense said their training was inadequate. Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane both said they deferred to Mr. Chauvin as the senior officer at the scene. Mr. Thao testified that he relied on the other officers to care for Mr. Floyd's medical needs as his attention was elsewhere.\n\nA jury of eight women and four men that appeared to be all-white reached the verdicts after about two days of deliberations. The court did not release demographics such as race or age. Mr. Lane is white, Mr. Kueng is Black and Mr. Thao is Hmong American.\n\nThe former officers remain free on bond pending sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled. Conviction of a federal civil rights violation that results in death is punishable by life in prison or even death, but such sentences are extremely rare. Federal sentencing guidelines rely on complicated formulas that indicate the officers would get much less.\n\nMr. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder last year in state court and pleaded guilty in December in the federal case. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in the state case. A sentencing date has not yet been set in the federal case, but both sides agreed Mr. Chauvin should face a sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years.\n\nPublic reaction to Thursday's verdicts was muted, with only a tiny handful of protesters visible outside the courthouse, which was surrounded by fencing throughout the trial. On the day Mr. Chauvin was convicted, many people listened live as his verdicts were read and crowded into the square where Mr. Floyd died for a celebration afterward. That trial was livestreamed, while this one was not.\n\nMr. Lane, Mr. Kueng, and Mr. Thao also face a separate trial in June on state charges alleging that they aided and abetted murder and manslaughter.\n\nThe verdicts come just days after the conviction of three white men on hate crimes charges in Georgia in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was chased and shot in February 2020.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

Minnesota guidelines call for 12.5 years, but factors such as cruelty and abuse of authority warranted a stronger sentence.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 25, 2021, 4:39 p.m. ET | Minneapolis\n\nFormer Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin has been sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd, whose dying gasps under Mr. Chauvin's knee led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the United States in generations.\n\nThe punishment handed out Friday fell short of the 30 years that prosecutors had requested.\n\nWith good behavior, Mr. Chauvin could be paroled after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years.\n\nFormer police Officer Derek Chauvin broke his long courtroom silence Friday as he faced sentencing for the murder of George Floyd, offering condolences to Mr. Floyd's family and saying he hopes more information coming out will give them \"some peace of mind.\"\n\nMr. Chauvin, who did not testify at his trial, removed his COVID-19 and turned toward the Floyd family, speaking only briefly because of what he called \"some additional legal matters at hand\" - an apparent reference to the federal civil rights trial he still faces.\n\n\"But very briefly, though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some peace of mind,\" he said, without elaborating.\n\nChauvin attorney Eric Nelson called Mr. Floyd's death \"tragic,\" and that Mr. Chauvin\"s \"brain is littered with what-ifs\" from the day: \"What if I just did not agree to go in that day? What if things had gone differently? What if I never responded to that call? What if what if what if?\"\n\nMr. Floyd's family members took the stand and expressed sorrow about his death. They asked for the maximum penalty.\n\n\"We don't want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We've been through that already,\" said a tearful Terrence Floyd, one of Mr. Floyd's brothers.\n\nMr. Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said: \"Our family is forever broken.\" And Mr. Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a video played in court, said that if she could say something to her father now, it would be: \"I miss you and I love you.\"\n\nProsecutor Matthew Frank asked the judge to exceed sentencing guidelines and give Mr. Chauvin 30 years in prison, saying \"tortured is the right word\" for what the officer did to Mr. Floyd.\n\n\"This is not a momentary gunshot, punch to the face. This is 91⁄2 minutes of cruelty to a man who was helpless and just begging for his life,\" Mr. Frank said.\n\nMr. Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, took the stand to plead for mercy for son, saying his reputation has been unfairly reduced to that of \"an aggressive, heartless, and uncaring person\" and a racist.\n\n\"I can tell you that is far from the truth,\" she told the judge. \"I want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man.\" She added: \"Derek, I want you to know I have always believed in your innocence, and I will never waver from that.\"\n\n\"I will be here for you when you come home,\" she said.\n\nThe concrete barricades, razor wire, and National Guard patrols at the courthouse during Mr, Chauvin's three-week trial in the spring were gone Friday, reflecting an easing of tensions since the verdict in April. Still, there was recognition that the sentencing was another major step forward for Minneapolis since Mr. Floyd died on May 25, 2020.\n\n\"Between the incident, the video, the riots, the trial - this is the pinnacle of it,\" said Mike Brandt, a local defense attorney who closely followed the case. \"The verdict was huge too, but this is where the justice comes down.\"\n\nMr. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Mr. Floyd's neck for up to 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn't breathe and went limp.\n\nBystander video of Mr. Floyd's arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store prompted protests around the world and led to scattered violence in Minneapolis and beyond.\n\nMinnesota sentencing guidelines called for 12 1/2 years, but Judge Peter Cahill agreed with prosecutors ahead of Friday's proceedings that there were aggravating circumstances that could justify a heavier punishment - among them, that Mr. Chauvin treated Mr. Floyd with particular cruelty, abused his position of authority as a police officer, and did it in front of children.\n\nThe defense requested probation, saying Mr. Chauvin was the product of a \"broken\" system and \"believed he was doing his job.\"\n\nWith good behavior, Mr. Chauvin could get out on parole after serving about two-thirds of his sentence.\n\nBefore the sentencing, the judge denied Mr. Chauvin's request for a new trial. Defense attorney Eric Nelson had argued that the intense publicity tainted the jury pool and that the trial should have been moved away from Minneapolis.\n\nThe judge also rejected a defense request for a hearing into possible juror misconduct. Mr. Nelson had accused a juror of not being candid during jury selection because he didn't mention his participation in a march last summer to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutors countered the juror had been open about his views.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, said relatives were \"anxious and tense\" ahead of the proceedings. \"To us, George Floyd is a cause. He's a case. He's a hashtag. To them - that's their flesh and blood. You know, that that's their brother,\" Mr. Crump said.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Chauvin would break his long silence and speak at his sentencing. Some experts had expressed doubt he would say anything because of the risk his words could be used against him in the federal case. No date for that trial has been set.\n\nBut Mr. Brandt said Mr. Chauvin could say a few words without getting into legal trouble. \"I think it's his chance to tell the world, 'I didn't intend to kill him,'\" the attorney said. \"If I was him, I think I would want to try and let people know that I'm not a monster.\"\n\nMr. Chauvin did not testify at his trial. The only explanation the public heard from him came from body-camera footage in which he told a bystander at the scene: \"We got to control this guy 'cause he's a sizable guy ... and it looks like he's probably on something.\"\n\nPhilip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, said 11 non-federal law officers, including Mr. Chauvin, have been convicted of murder for on-duty deaths since 2005. The penalties for the nine who were sentenced before Mr. Chauvin ranged from from six years, nine months, to life behind bars, with the median being 15 years.\n\nWith Mr. Chauvin's sentencing, the Floyd family and Black America faced something of a rarity: In the small number of instances in which officers accused of brutality or other misconduct against Black people have gone to trial, the list of acquittals and mistrials is longer than the list of sentencings after conviction.\n\nIn recent years, the acquittals have included officers tried in the deaths of Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two mistrials were declared over the death of Samuel Dubose in Cincinnati.\n\n\"That's why the world has watched this trial, because it is a rare occurrence,\" said Arizona-based civil rights attorney Benjamin Taylor, who has represented victims of police brutality. \"Everybody knows that this doesn't happen every day.\"\n\nSeveral people interviewed in Minneapolis before Mr. Chauvin's sentencing said they wanted to see a tough sentence.\n\nThirty years \"doesn't seem like long enough to me,\" said Andrew Harer, a retail worker who is white. \"I would be fine if he was in jail for the rest of his life.\"\n\nJoseph Allen, who is Black, said he would like to see Mr. Chauvin get a life sentence, adding that he hopes other police officers learn \"not to do what Derek Chauvin did.\"\n\nAs for whether she would like to hear Mr. Chauvin speak, Levy Armstrong said: \"For me as a Black woman living in this community, there's really nothing that he could say that would alleviate the pain and trauma that he caused. ... I think that if he spoke it would be disingenuous and could cause more trauma.\"\n\nMr. Chauvin has been held since his conviction at the state's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, where he has been kept in a cell by himself for his own protection, his meals brought to him.\n\nThe three other officers are scheduled for trial in March on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

Mr. Floyd's family says that's not long enough. The defense argued that Mr. Lane was the least culpable of the officers involved.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 22, 2022, 10:44 a.m. ET | St. Paul, Minn.\n\nA federal judge sentenced former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane to 2 1/2 years in prison Thursday for violating George Floyd's civil rights, calling Mr. Lane's role in the restraint that killed Mr. Floyd \"a very serious offense in which a life was lost\" but handing down a sentence well below what prosecutors and Mr. Floyd's family sought.\n\nJudge Paul Magnuson's sentence was just slightly more than the 27 months that Mr. Lane's attorney had requested, while prosecutors had asked for at least 5 1/4 years in prison - the low end of federal guidelines. Mr. Lane was convicted earlier this year of depriving Mr. Floyd of his right to medical care.\n\nMr. Lane, who is white, held Mr. Floyd's legs as Officer Derek Chauvin pinned Mr. Floyd's neck with his knee for nearly 9 1/2 minutes on May 25, 2020. Bystander video of Mr. Floyd, who was Black, pleading that he could not breathe sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the world in a reckoning over racial injustice over policing.\n\nTwo other officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were also convicted of violating Mr. Floyd's civil rights - for depriving Mr. Floyd of his right to medical care and for failing to intervene to stop Mr. Chauvin - and will be sentenced later.\n\nFloyd family members had asked Judge Magnuson to give Mr. Lane the stiffest sentence possible, with brother Philonise Floyd rejecting the idea that Mr. Lane deserved any mercy for asking his colleagues twice if George Floyd should be shifted from his stomach to his side.\n\n\"Officer Lane did not intervene in one way or another,\" he said.\n\nProsecutor Manda Sertich had also argued for a higher sentence, saying that Mr. Lane \"chose not to act\" when he could have saved a life.\n\n\"There has to be a line where blindly following a senior officer's lead, even for a rookie officer, is not acceptable,\" she said.\n\nJudge Magnuson told Mr. Lane the \"fact that you did not get up and remove Mr. Chauvin when Mr. Floyd became unconscious is a violation of the law.\" But he also held up 145 letters he said he had received supporting Mr. Lane, saying he had never received so many on behalf of a defendant. And he faulted the Minneapolis Police Department for sending Mr. Lane with another rookie officer on the call that ended in Mr. Floyd's death.\n\nJudge Magnuson cited two letters in particular that he said came from doctors who recounted a situation when their diagnosis was overruled by a more senior physician, \"to disastrous result to the patient.\" He said the doctors described being haunted that they did not stand up to the senior physician.\n\n\"It speaks loudly to this case,\" Judge Magnuson said.\n\nIn sentencing Mr. Chauvin earlier this month on a civil rights charge in Mr. Floyd's killing, Judge Magnuson appeared to suggest that he bore the most blame in the case, telling Mr. Chauvin: \"You absolutely destroyed the lives of three young officers by taking command of the scene.\"\n\nMr. Lane did not speak at Thursday's sentencing and neither he nor his attorney, Earl Gray, commented to reporters afterward. Philonise Floyd called the sentence \"insulting\" and said he didn't understand why Mr. Lane - whom he called \"an accessory to murder'' - didn't get the toughest possible sentence.\n\n\"To me I think this whole criminal system needs to be torn down and rebuilt,\" he said.\n\nJudge Magnuson also said he would recommend that Mr. Lane serve his sentence at the federal prison in Duluth, a minimum-security facility about 2 1/2 hours from the Minneapolis area. The facility is classified as a \"camp,\" has no fence and has dormitory-style housing rather than cells. Prison assignments are made by the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nMr. Gray argued during the trial that Mr. Lane \"did everything he could possibly do to help George Floyd.\" He pointed out that Mr. Lane suggested rolling Mr. Floyd on his side so he could breathe, but was rebuffed twice by Mr. Chauvin. He also noted that Mr. Lane performed CPR to try to revive Mr. Floyd after the ambulance arrived.\n\nMr. Lane testified at trial that he didn't realize how dire Mr. Floyd's condition was until paramedics turned him over.\n\nWhen Mr. Lane pleaded guilty in state court in May to one charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, Mr. Gray said Mr. Lane hoped to avoid a long sentence. \"He has a newborn baby and did not want to risk not being part of the child's life,\" he said.\n\nMr. Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to a federal civil rights charge in Mr. Floyd's killing and to another civil rights charge in an unrelated case involving a Black teenager. That netted a 21-year sentence from Judge Magnuson, toward the low end of 20- to 25-year range both sides agreed to under his plea deal.\n\nMr. Chauvin was also convicted of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in state court and is serving a 22 1/2-year state sentence. His federal and state sentences are being served simultaneously.\n\nMr. Kueng pinned Mr. Floyd's back during the restraint and Mr. Thao helped hold back an increasingly concerned group of onlookers outside a Minneapolis convenience store where Mr. Floyd, who was unarmed, tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nJudge Magnuson has not set sentencing dates for Mr. Thao, who is Hmong American, and Mr. Kueng, who is Black. But he has scheduled a hearing for Friday, after their attorneys objected to sentencing calculations under the complicated federal guidelines. Prosecutors are seeking unspecified sentences for them that would be lower than Mr. Chauvin's but \"substantially higher\" than Mr. Lane's.\n\nMr. Thao and Mr. Kueng are free on bond pending sentencing on their federal convictions.

Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao on aiding and abetting counts is the third and likely final criminal proceeding stemming from the case.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Oct. 23, 2022, 3:46 p.m. ET | Minneapolis\n\nTwo former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death are heading to trial on state aiding and abetting counts, the third and likely final criminal proceeding in a killing that mobilized protesters worldwide against racial injustice in policing.\n\nJ. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted of federal counts for violating Mr. Floyd's civil rights and begun serving those sentences. Many witnesses expected to testify at their state trial have already done so at both their federal trial and at the state trial against their former colleague, Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murder.\n\nWhile much of the evidence in this proceeding will look similar, there will be some key differences.\n\nHere are a few things to know as jury selection gets underway Monday:\n\nWhat is this trial about?\n\nMr. Kueng, Mr. Thao and Thomas Lane were working with Mr. Chauvin on May 25, 2020, when Mr. Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin Mr. Floyd's neck to the pavement for more than nine minutes as Mr. Floyd said he couldn't breathe and eventually grew still. Mr. Kueng knelt on Mr. Floyd's back, Mr. Lane held his legs and Mr. Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMr. Kueng, who is Black, and Mr. Thao, who is Hmong American, are each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors will have to prove they intentionally helped Mr. Chauvin. They don't have to prove that they intended to kill Mr. Floyd or cause him great bodily harm.\n\nThe third trial\n\nMr. Chauvin was the first officer to face trial in a livestreamed, weekslong proceeding filled with emotional testimony from bystanders, graphic video of Mr. Floyd's dying moments and expert testimony about use of force as well as the mechanics of breathing. He was ultimately convicted of murder and manslaughter.\n\nThe second trial in Mr. Floyd's death came in federal court, where Mr. Lane, Mr. Kueng and Mr. Thao were all convicted of federal civil rights violations.\n\n\"It's going to be, I think, exhaustingly repetitive for the witnesses who have already testified multiple times and don't want to relive this,\" said Rachel Moran, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.\n\nBut there will be some nuances. Ms. Moran said this case could be more difficult for prosecutors: While Mr. Chauvin's offense was more direct because he had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck, prosecutors in this case have to show what Mr. Kueng and Mr. Thao intentionally did to help him commit a crime.\n\nJudge Peter Cahill has limited expert witnesses to try to avoid repetition. He's also ordered attorneys not to ask questions designed to elicit emotion.\n\nNotable differences\n\nWitnesses won't be allowed to ask the jury to take actions and follow along with demonstrations - as lung and critical care specialist Dr. Martin Tobin did during Mr. Chauvin's trial. In that case, Dr. Tobin placed his hands on his own neck and encouraged jurors to do the same as he explained how he believed Mr. Floyd died. Jurors said later that Tobin provided some of the trial's most compelling evidence.\n\nIt's also unknown if a girl who was just 9 at the time of Mr. Floyd's killing will testify. Prosecutors want to call her to argue that even a young girl knew something was wrong - so the officers should have known as well. The defense has countered that her testimony isn't that different from that of other bystanders and will only play upon jurors' emotions. She previously testified at Mr. Chauvin's trial.\n\nJudge Cahill encouraged prosecutors not to call the girl because testifying in a murder trial can be traumatic, especially for children, but he didn't bar them from doing so.\n\nWere plea deals offered?\n\nYes. Both Mr. Kueng and Mr. Thao rejected offers for three-year sentences that would have been served at the same time as their federal sentences. Mr. Thao told Judge Cahill: \"It would be lying for me to accept any plea offer.\"\n\nThat set them apart from Mr. Lane, who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter and got three years. Mr. Kueng and Mr. Thao are risking significantly longer sentences; the murder charge has a recommended sentence of 12 1/2 years, and prosecutors say they intend to seek more.\n\n\"The reality is, it's their right (to go to trial) and Tou Thao in particular seems to just believe that he has done nothing wrong and therefore he can't admit to doing anything wrong,\" Ms. Moran said.\n\nJury selection\n\nHundreds of prospective jurors were sent a 17-page questionnaire that explored how much they know about the case, their views on police and whether they've participated in civil rights marches, among other things.\n\nSixteen people will be chosen; 12 will deliberate.\n\nJurors will be questioned individually about their views and whether they can be fair. An unlimited number of potential jurors can be dismissed \"for cause,\" such as when a juror has shown that he or she can't be impartial.\n\nEach side may also dismiss jurors with a limited number of peremptory strikes, which don't require a reason but can be challenged if the other side believes it's due solely to a potential juror's race or gender.\n\nThe defense gets 10 such strikes - five for each defendant - and the state gets six.\n\nThe key will be finding jurors who can be impartial. Ms. Moran said that while diversity on a jury is important, the idea that a jury's racial composition will affect the outcome has been called into question. She noted that the jury that convicted Mr. Kueng and Mr. Thao of federal charges was mostly white, as was the state jury that convicted Kim Potter, then an officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, in the 2021 fatal shooting of Black motorist Daunte Wright.\n\nTrial logistics\n\nOpening statements begin Nov. 7. The trial won't be livestreamed. Cameras in courts are rare in Minnesota, and Mr. Chauvin's was livestreamed due to the high public interest and courtroom space limitations because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nMr. Kueng and Mr. Thao reported to federal prison earlier this month to begin serving their sentences for violating Mr. Floyd's rights. Mr. Kueng is serving three years at federal prison in Ohio and Mr. Thao is serving 31⁄2 years at a facility in Kentucky.\n\nThey will be in custody in Minnesota during the trial.\n\nMr. Lane, who is white, is serving his 2 1⁄2-year federal sentence at a facility in Colorado. He's serving a 3-year state sentence at the same time.\n\nMr. Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1⁄2 years on the state murder charge and 21 years on a federal count of violating Mr. Floyd's rights. He's serving those sentences simultaneously at a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For Jabari Butler, an Atlanta father, husband, and minister, this moment feels very familiar. But he is \"cautiously optimistic\" this time will be different and ignite true change. This is his story, as told to Chandra Thomas Whitfield.\n\nThe racial unrest unfolding on American streets may be surprising for many, but for me as an African American man, it almost feels like too little, too late.\n\nI may be a media technology entrepreneur, husband, minister, and father to a precious 8-year-old daughter today, but in 1991, I was an 18-year-old young black man in Oakland, California, already well acquainted with police brutality.\n\nCourtesy of Rev. Jabari Butler Jabari Butler poses as a freshman at Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1991, months after his violent run-in with police officers in his hometown of Oakland, California.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death jolted many Americans awake to a pattern of injustice that has been fully apparent to black Americans for decades. In this essay, Jabari Butler, an Atlanta father, husband, and minister, shares how this pattern has been woven into his own life. And why he is cautiously optimistic that change will come.\n\nWatching that video of George Floyd sprawled on the ground, his face pressed into the pavement as he suffocated under the weight of a Minneapolis police officer's knee atop his neck, always brings me back to a place that, to this day, crushes the very depths of my soul. See, if it were not for the grace of God, I might have faced a similar fate.\n\nOne summer evening, my two friends and I were driving through downtown Oakland, when we came upon a commotion. There had been a shootout and pandemonium had broken out in the streets. People were running in every direction and sounds of gunfire, glass breaking, and screaming echoed loudly in our ears.\n\nWe began circling the area frantically searching for my then-girlfriend, who'd been partying nearby. Suddenly, about seven Oakland police officers descended upon my burgundy '80s-era T-top Monte Carlo with guns drawn. They ordered us to stop and one reached inside my driver's side window. For as long as I live, I will never forget the sight of the steel glistening off his gun aimed at my temple, so close I could only make out the cop's milky white knuckles. His finger was on the trigger without the safety engaged. I remember thinking: If I move one inch, my life will likely end right here.\n\nOne cop yelled out: \"Don't move or I'll shoot.\" Another threatened to shoot if I didn't turn off my car. I froze, overwhelmed by the conflicting directions. My buddy Bakari broke me out of my shocked state: \"Just think, don't react,\" he shrieked, as one officer beat him with a nightstick in the back seat. I slowly lifted my hands and rested them atop the steering wheel. The officer who'd pointed his weapon handcuffed me while I was still seated, my car still in drive.\n\nAll three of us were yanked from the car and our faces shoved into the pavement, much like Mr. Floyd's had been, while they searched the car for a nonexistent weapon. Nothing was found, but we were still loaded into a squad car. I believe one or all of us might have ended up shot that night, if it weren't for a former classmate, a black girl, who'd begun crying loudly nearby. She had witnessed everything and they knew it.\n\nWe were released that night and nothing became of the complaints that our parents later filed with police. My church, Allen Temple, shared our story with the congregation and even hosted a community forum. I later found out that the late rapper Tupac Shakur had sued and won following a similar encounter with Oakland police officers. That would have to be my vindication.\n\nSo for me, this moment is about George Floyd, but at the same time it's not. It's also about the thousands, dare I say millions, of nameless and faceless black men and women, American citizens, who do not have a video to \"prove\" to the world the abusive and violent treatment we regularly endure at the hands of police sworn to \"protect and serve\" us.\n\nThe parallels of these historic times don't end there for me. Less than an hour after wrapping up business meetings in downtown Atlanta just over a week ago, I turned on the television at home to learn that protesters, angry over Mr. Floyd's murder, had begun storming the same streets I had just left. A horde of demonstrators began aggressively pushing on the glass entrance to CNN, until it shattered. Cars were burning, people were shouting, and the smoky remnants of tear gas hung heavy in the air. Those raw images immediately transported me back to a similar scene in the area more than 20 years earlier.\n\nIt was 1992, not even a full year after my run-in with Oakland Police, and I was a freshman at Atlanta's Morehouse College. This time our outrage was over the not-guilty verdicts handed down to the Los Angeles police officers who'd beaten a handcuffed Rodney King within an inch of his life. A video, rare for that time, had captured the entire incident. Naively, many of us thought video evidence would make a difference. Their acquittals felt like yet another slap in the face, and we were furious.\n\nInstead of studying for our final exams as planned, we Morehouse students, along with students from the other nearby historically black schools - Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, Morris Brown College, and Interdenominational Theological Center - planned and carried out a peaceful protest. Marching across all of our campuses belting out \"We Shall Overcome\" alongside some civil rights-era Freedom Riders felt empowering and comforting.\n\nOnce we reached nearby downtown Atlanta, though, the tone changed dramatically. As others joined in, the demonstration turned violent. Looting, fires, overturned cars - total chaos - ensued.\n\nI didn't - and still don't - agree with such tumultuous responses, but I understand. Like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (an alum of Morehouse) said in a television interview three years after his famed \"I Have a Dream\" speech: A \"riot is the language of the unheard.\"\n\nYou see, what happened to Mr. Floyd is not new to me or America for that matter - having a video recording displaying it in such graphic detail is. What we're witnessing in this moment, people of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds speaking in support of the humanity of black people, is new, too.\n\nI am cautiously optimistic that this will be the much-needed turning point that America so desperately needs to begin reaching her full potential. As Dr. King also put it: \"Injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere.\" Police brutality and the violence that American citizens regularly impose upon black citizens with little or no consequence is an injustice that must stop. Look no further than the Ahmaud Arbery case in Georgia as an example.\n\nWhat happened to me in Oakland was traumatic, and watching videos of the modern-day lynchings of Mr. Floyd and others like Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Philando Castile are often triggering. But the real trauma is that nearly 30 years later, such treatment persists. Only justice and substantive change can provide me and the black community with some much-deserved relief.\n\nWhat many Americans are seeing now, mostly on television screens from the cushy comforts of their homes, is the result of black Americans being fed up and tired of being told directly and indirectly that our humanity does not equal that of a white person. When exactly do we deserve to enjoy the benefits - the full benefits - the United States Constitution purportedly guarantees all Americans?\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He has since been shunned by the NFL.\n\n\"Most of them, they were against [Kaepernick] doing that, and I felt that was wrong,\" says Ms. Bell, who is among an organized group of mothers whose sons are part of the ever-growing roll call of black men killed by police. \"That was what he chose to do to show honor to those who were killed by police officers. And by the cops kneeling today, to me, I guess they're trying to do what he did. I guess by kneeling they are at least trying to show a peaceful sign to the protesters.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to kneel? Officers taking a knee in the wake of George Floyd's killing in police custody mark a powerful change in tone after the controversy over Colin Kaepernick's career-ending protest.\n\nHer own son, Sean Bell, was shot and killed by New York City plainclothes cops in 2006, in the early morning hours before his wedding. During his bachelor party, undercover officers said they saw a gun in his vehicle, and opened fire with a hail of 50 bullets. No weapon was found. Three officers were tried and acquitted of manslaughter.\n\nMs. Bell is part of an organized group of mothers with the Justice Committee , which includes Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner; Constance Malcolm, the mother of Ramarley Graham; Herencia Petersen, aunt of Akai Gurley; as well as more than a dozen others who have formed a bond, she says, as the names of their sons continue to be chanted during protests.\n\n\"But when you see these officers take a knee, you also think, 'Oh my God, the cop who killed George Floyd kneeled like that on this poor man's neck' - and he was a strong man, and all he could do, I mean, he was just crying out for his mother,\" Ms. Bell says. \"It's not a good feeling; it's like opening up a wound all over again.\"\n\nShe pauses and then says, softly, \"I mean, 50 shots. Fifty shots.\"\n\n\"I know they were flipping it, yes, taking a knee to show peace and honor and humility - and that's right, that's a good thing,\" she continues. \"But that's not all that matters.\"\n\nFor the past few months, Ms. Bell, Ms. Carr, Ms. Malcolm, and 15 other mothers have been working to demand the repeal of New York's \"police secrecy law,\" which keeps all disciplinary records out of public view.\n\nEven as Ms. Bell and other activists feel ambivalent about watching police officers take a symbolic knee in the presence of those protesting the killing of George Floyd, those gestures mark a powerful change in tone after the angry controversy over Mr. Kaepernick's career-ending protest.\n\nThis Sunday in New York, many protesters were startled by NYPD officers kneeling - apparently in solidarity with them - in the middle of an intersection in Queens.\n\nLed by the commanding officer of the precinct, Deputy Inspector Vincent Tavalaro, the group of officers was cheered with cries of \"thank you\" by protesters who formed a circle around them, and captured in photos and videos on social media. \"Keep that knee!\" many began to chant after the officers stood up. So, they took a knee again.\n\n\"We need more of this, to see and hear each other, to work together, to recognize that our differences are our strength,\" tweeted NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shae, including a photo of Commander Tavalaro embracing protesters.\n\nOn Monday, a group of more than 60 police officers in Fayetteville, North Carolina , dressed in riot gear, defused a tense confrontation with protesters by taking a knee as a group approached them just before the city's 8 p.m. curfew.\n\nInstead of tear gas and physical confrontations, there were tears, and even embraces, between Fayetteville police and many protesters, witnesses say.\n\n\"The protesters first got mad when asked to step back, but once the officers knelt down, it was on,\" commented Mimamo Monika on the Fayetteville Police Department's Facebook page. \"Men and women alike started crying and then cautiously came toward the police officers to shake their hands.\"\n\n\"The protesters thought they were going to be arrested, but our Fayetteville PD humbly knelt before them instead,\" the commenter continued. \"These are moments that will go down into history and will be taught to future generations.\"\n\nSimilar gestures of humility and respect between police officers and protesters have been occurring in cities across the U.S. Often dressed in full riot gear, groups of police in Portland, Oregon; Santa Cruz, California; Coral Gables, Florida; El Paso, Texas; and Flint, Michigan, have collectively taken a knee to offer a gesture of solidarity, acts that have mostly diffused tension and drawn cheers.\n\nThe poignance of these images have been peaceful counterpoints to the rage sweeping across the country. Bands have looted and vandalized buildings, and there have been instances of police officers being attacked.\n\nBut in other cities, police have beaten, gassed, and targeted protesters and journalists with rubber bullets. And sometimes, the very police department whose officers knelt with protesters have then been abusive. On Wednesday, Buffalo Police Department officers, too, knelt before protesters , drawing cheers. The next day, however, at the same spot they had kneeled, Buffalo officers shoved an elderly man to the ground and walked over him as he lay bleeding on the sidewalk. Two officers involved were immediately suspended, the department said.\n\nBut for many who have watched efforts to address the long and troubling history of racial inequities in American law enforcement, the symbolic gesture of police officers taking a knee as protesters march against the killing of George Floyd in police custody is a positive sign.\n\n\"I think the image of police officers kneeling is so very powerful, given how Colin Kaepernick made that gesture the preeminent symbol of protest against police killings of unarmed black people,\" says Mark Naison, professor of African American studies and history at Fordham University in New York.\n\n\"Seeing police officers, some of whom are white, take a knee to protest the death of George Floyd is even more significant because the only way to get rid of racists and white supremacists and serial abusers on police forces is for their fellow officers to expose them and demand they be removed,\" he says.\n\nAs many officers embrace the act of kneeling, some people are reevaluating their feelings about the protests of Mr. Kaepernick.\n\n\"It is interesting to note that Kaepernick started his protests by sitting during the national anthem, but after discussion with a veteran who was offended by his actions , he switched to kneeling because it was more respectful,\" says Jennifer Lambe, professor of communication at the University of Delaware.\n\n\"Police officers kneeling alongside protesters has been a welcome start to many, signifying hope that a new way of communicating about police brutality is possible,\" she says.\n\nIn fact, there is an inherent dignity in the act of kneeling throughout history, many scholars say, and it has long been an essential act of humility and respect in the spheres of religion and politics.\n\n\"When we kneel, we recognize that we are before someone or something that is greater than we are,\" says Linda Seger, a Quaker scholar and author of \"Jesus Rode a Donkey,\" which explores the intersection of religion and liberal politics.\n\n\"Sometimes that something is evil, and we are forced to our knees before what is dark and overpowering,\" Dr. Seger continues. \"But in most cases, taking a knee is a sign of chosen humility. We realize we are vulnerable, and we even accept it. We kneel in the hope that we can be renewed and cleansed and forgiven, and with the hope that a wrong will be recognized and righted, and that goodness will ultimately be victorious.\"\n\nFor Ms. Bell and others, however, the image of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd's neck, even as he lay prostrate, bound, and crying out for his mother, should remain the focus.\n\nNo matter how many police officers make this gesture, she says, there can be no victory for goodness or any lasting change until significant structural changes in America's law enforcement systems take hold.\n\n\"They talk about the training, the training, the training,\" she says. \"But what type of training are you doing with these police officers, when this happens again and again? There has to be accountability and transparency - and the good ones do need to speak out about the bad ones, because now they don't because of the 'blue wall of silence.'\"\n\nNearly 15 years after her son Sean was shot and killed by police, this month has been particularly poignant. Her son's two daughters are both graduating - the youngest was five months old when he was killed, and she's now finishing junior high. His oldest is graduating from high school and plans to attend law school.\n\n\"We have to stay on the politicians' back, just like we are now in New York,\" Ms. Bell says. \"I hope and pray they will come to a sense that to make this change, we have to do something different. Like I tell everybody, I might not see the change while I'm living, but I pray that my children and my grandchildren will help make that change for the country they will have to rebuild.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct dates.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Dozens upon dozens of murals of Mr. Floyd and other victims of police violence have sprung up on walls across the United States. Street artists are taking advantage of the immediacy of this most public of art forms to beautify drab urban spaces and reach the hearts of viewers.\n\nThey're also continuing a rich artistic tradition of muralists who've used outdoor canvases to convey political messages. During the New Deal, for instance, Diego Rivera's murals highlighted the toil of industrial workers. But it was the arrival of spray cans that truly democratized street art and empowered a young generation to express itself. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the burgeoning punk and hip-hop scenes in Philadelphia and New York spurred teenagers to both deface and decorate subway trains and urban spaces with stylized slogans and signatures. Elegant forms of stylized graffiti, the progenitor of street art, started to emerge from spray paint scribbles.\n\nAs movements for racial justice have rocked the country, murals have become a striking part of the protest - and healing - process. Our culture writer talked to five street artists to understand what's prompting the revival of this political art form.\n\n\"This is an art form that was started by Black and brown and Latinx teenagers in their marginalized communities because of the injustices that they're facing and because that was their outlet and their voice,\" says Liza Quiñonez, founder of Murals for the Movement , an initiative to rebuild communities in Boston, New York, and Los Angeles with uplifting murals by Black and other minority artists.\n\nLong before Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring hung pieces of art in ritzy galleries to decry racism and the devastation of AIDS, they were street artists. Mr. Haring's 1986 anti-drug mural, \"Crack Is Wack,\" in East Harlem remains New York's most famous mural. More recently, the likes of Shepard Fairey (most famous for his Barack Obama \"Hope\" poster) and the mysterious Banksy (most famous for his playful pranks) have become global icons through their Instagram-shareable street art that advocates for social justice and other causes.\n\nNot all street art is political, of course. Subjects range from the prosaic (portraits, landscapes, animals) to the imaginative (surrealist trompe l'oeil optical illusions whose meanings are as elliptical as Salvador Dalí's mustache). But the global art form remains a visible form of public protest in places such as Mexico City, Beirut, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Santiago, and cities across America.\n\n\"All these different movements are quite specific in their political concerns, but I do feel that it's fair to put them under one political umbrella, which is artists are looking for an audience, eyeballs, really, when it comes to drawing more attention to their political concerns,\" says Liz Munsell, co-curator of a new exhibition, \"Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation,\" at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. \"Artists throughout history have been at the forefront of introducing very progressive social ideas into society and paving the path towards normalizing them.\"\n\n\"It's a voice for the voiceless,\" adds Sami Wakim, who runs the Street Art United States website, a hub dedicated to worldwide murals that instill a sense of hope, as well as history, through creative expression.\n\nThe Monitor reached out to five professional street artists to hear their stories. Reliant upon commissions, grants, and sponsorship from nonprofits and businesses, they approach murals from different art traditions (several of them employ graffiti nicknames). But what they share is that they're using murals to counter racism and denounce police violence by presenting affirmative images of Black people.\n\nHe starts painting at 5 a.m., racing against the sun. From atop his forklift crane, Rob \"ProBlak\" Gibbs - one of Boston's foremost graffiti and street artists - resumes work on a multistory mural at the Madison Park Technical Vocational High School. As dawn glistens on nearby skyscrapers, he observes nature's daily shift change as bats cede the sky to birds. The artist's thoughts flit to his 2-year-old daughter as his spray cans rattle and spit. She inspired his mural of a young Black girl floating above the ground with wings on her sneakers.\n\nMr. Gibbs says the message of the mural is, \"The future is in our children. Regardless of your culture. If you are a child to this world, you are contributing to a better future.\"\n\nHe believes that the timing of the image coincides with the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\"I know a higher power is playing into everything we do,\" the veteran graffiti artist says later, sweat beading on his forehead during a midmorning break. \"I'm here to give a positive balance. Not to say I'm not hearing what's happening or that I don't have an opinion, but while the young people are speaking, I'm just letting them know, 'Yo, I hear you.'\"\n\nMr. Gibbs, an artist-in-residence at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, co-founded Artists for Humanity , a studio to mentor young artists, most of whom are minorities. Today, an art class of teens hovers near the mural as Mr. Gibbs tops up a paint canister and dons a respirator that looks like the bottom half of Darth Vader's mask.\n\n\"If you're giving the youth the ability to open their mouth to say something and it's on a platform to be seen and heard? Let's go man,\" says Mr. Gibbs. \"Let's lean into these conversations. Let's see if we can do better if we just teach each other to do better.\"\n\nIn Denver, Thomas \"Detour\" Evans sees canvases where ordinary people see impassive hunks of stone, brick, and concrete.\n\n\"I saw a wall and it spoke to me and said it needs a George Floyd on there,\" says Mr. Evans, who branched out from ambitious art museum exhibitions built around his paintings to street art in 2015.\n\nOnce he'd received permission to paint the surface from the building's owner, his friend Hiero Veiga came over to help. Mr. Evans created the lower part of Mr. Floyd's face, rendering it with impressionistic color. Mr. Veiga, a distinguished graffiti writer, muralist, and fine artist, painted a more realistic skin tone. The effect was to make it seem as if life was being breathed back into the body.\n\nSoon after, the pair were offered spaces to memorialize two other people who died recently from police violence, Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain. Mr. Evans calls the series a \"Spray Their Name\" campaign. Like all street artists, he shares his work on Instagram.\n\n\"We are visual historians of what is happening today,\" says the artist, who is the subject of the documentary \"Detour,\" on Amazon Prime. \"As many of the marches die down and there's more distraction for people as things open up ... I like having that as a reminder of what's really important.\"\n\nA strikingly different type of Black Lives Matter portrait was recently unveiled across the street from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Sophia Dawson painted a mural depicting Eric Garner, the victim of asphyxiation by a police officer, as a child. He poses smiling alongside his sister, Lisha, and his brother Emery. Titled \"For Gwen,\" the mural is dedicated to the mother of Mr. Garner.\n\n\"A mother's loss of a child is a universal loss,\" explains Ms. Dawson, whose long-standing activism for criminal justice reform stems from watching documentaries in college as well as her own mother's incarceration. \"I was really trying to tap into the hearts of people that don't care and don't see and that don't feel, because I think they're blinded in a way. And I'm hoping that my art will lift the veil off their faces so that they can see things the way I see it.\"\n\nMs. Dawson, a fine artist who is entirely new to street art and using spray paint, also collaborated on a mural where she painted Mr. Floyd as an infant in the arms of his mother. In another Black Lives Matter mural in Foley Square in Manhattan, Ms. Dawson filled the \"L\" in the phrase with portraits of mothers whose children have been killed by police.\n\n\"I believe my gift is from God, so I use it as a form of service,\" says Ms. Dawson, who teaches art classes at Rikers Island, a jail for New Yorkers, most of whom are awaiting trial. \"We're meant to bless other people, to heal other people, to liberate other people.\"\n\nLong before he went to college to become a professional designer, Cedric \"Vise1\" Douglas learned his craft with quick, furtive paint strokes of aerosol cans on the streets. Scanning other people's sneakers for telltale aerosol splatter, he joined a crew in Boston and tagged walls as Fanes, a playful twist on the word \"finesse.\" Recognizing his talent for art was, Mr. Douglas says, akin to discovering he possessed a superpower.\n\n\"The cool thing about graffiti was it was like my second superhero outfit,\" he says. \"I'm Cedric Douglas by day, but at night I'm Fanes. So it was like people didn't know who you were. But you had something that you knew you were doing that no one knew.\"\n\nNot even his own family knew about his pastime. When Mr. Douglas was arrested for elaborate artwork on a derelict basketball court, the police he'd fled from during a foot chase were far more genial than his livid mother. Compounding his mother's ire: The Boston Globe covered the incident. Indeed, some street art is considered vandalism under the law and may be punishable with fines or imprisonment if people are caught by the police. But Mr. Douglas knew that his interest in graffiti had steered him away from worse paths. After college, he and his partner Julia Roth started their own mobile art vehicle, dubbed the Up Truck, to mentor children.\n\n\"We'd go around teaching people how to be creative,\" he says. \"Some of the things we do teach is spray paint, which is kind of ironic since I got arrested for using it.\"\n\nMr. Douglas has painted many pieces protesting violence, including portraits of nine victims of the 2015 mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. For a recent art project, Mr. Douglas created yellow caution tape featuring the last words of Black people killed by police, including Mr. Garner's \"I can't breathe.\" When he handed out reels of the tape to Black Lives Matter protesters in June, the front page of The Boston Globe featured a photograph of someone holding a strip with the words \"Don't shoot.\"\n\n\"A lot of the work I try to do is paint Black men and women in a positive light,\" says Mr. Douglas, who was nominated for the Ad Club of Boston's 2016 Rosoff Award for individuals changing the city through diversity and inclusion. \"One of the issues we have with racism is that a lot of people have a negative perception of Black men and women. A lot of people just aren't around a lot of different cultures. Boston is very siloed, and there's Black neighborhoods and there's white neighborhoods.\"\n\nFor much of the coronavirus shutdown, Robert Vargas has been working on one of the world's most ambitious - and dangerous - pieces of art. He's been painting \"Angelus,\" one of the world's largest murals, entirely freehand on the side of a 14-story Los Angeles building. Ascending two stories on the swaying scaffolding can feel like an additional 1,000 feet, says Mr. Vargas, who explains that \"Angelus\" celebrates ethnic diversity in an inclusive city. But when the Black Lives Matter protests came through his downtown neighborhood, the internationally known fine artist came back down to earth. He watched rioting and looting break out while standing in front of another of his murals, \"Our Lady of DTLA.\"\n\nDays later, when the ransacked Starbucks across the street from him erected wooden boards to cover its broken windows, Mr. Vargas saw an opportunity to turn a \"black eye for our community and a bit of an eyesore\" into a positive message. He used the planks as a canvas to paint the word \"Justice.\" The word is split into two. Mr. Floyd's eyes sit between the two fragments.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

After observing artists painting the slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" in gigantic letters on streets across the country, he decided to make a statement of his own. He painted the words \"Change,\" \"Peace,\" \"Unity,\" and \"Love\" over the four crosswalks directly beneath his high-rise studio. He named the piece \"Intersection of Introspection.\"\n\n\"You'll be able to take one of these roads, make a left, make a right, and then find the Black Lives Matter intersection somewhere else,\" says Mr. Vargas, a fine artist in the classical tradition. \"If you're down with Black Lives Matter, then that's the destination. If you don't understand Black Lives Matter, then that's the origin.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

On a recent afternoon, Irma Burns stood beside the makeshift memorial with phone in hand, taking photos of the image of her dead son.\n\nMr. Clark's fatal shooting six years ago ignited an 18-day protest outside the 4th Precinct police station two blocks away. The upheaval laid bare long-running tensions between the city's communities of color and its mostly white police force - tensions that continued to build before detonating last May when officers killed George Floyd.\n\n\"Our Black community has been hurting a long time,\" Ms. Burns says. Local and federal authorities declined to bring charges against the two white officers involved in the death of the 24-year-old Mr. Clark, the youngest of her 10 children. \"What happened to George was just the latest tragedy.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd's death changed the conversation on police in America, launching the biggest civil rights movement in 50 years. What will Derek Chauvin's trial mean for that movement?\n\nThe video of Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Mr. Floyd's neck as two other officers held him down and a third stood by touched off nationwide protests against police brutality and racial inequality. The uproar gave rise to the country's broadest grassroots movement since the civil rights era as supporters called for Minneapolis and other cities to defund and reform police departments and rethink violence prevention strategies.\n\nTen months later, with Mr. Chauvin's murder trial underway at a downtown courthouse fortified by concrete barricades, armored military vehicles, and National Guard troops, momentum for change has slowed and splintered here. An increase in violent crime in Minneapolis since Mr. Floyd's death has fanned opposition to new public safety models, while the pandemic has compounded racial disparities in income, housing, and health care.\n\nThe trial of Mr. Chauvin - who faces charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter - has deepened the sense of foreboding in the state's largest city. The prospect of the 12-member jury acquitting the former officer stirs concerns among residents that Minneapolis could erupt in fury again, imperiling progress on public safety reforms.\n\nMs. Burns and her fellow advocates, convinced that the trial's emotional toll will fall hardest on minority residents, intend to sustain pressure on local officials to remedy the city's policing problems, irrespective of the verdict. They view the outcome and the potential for unrest in the context of the ceaseless fight for racial justice.\n\n\"I pray the jury does the right thing, but what people want is bigger than one trial,\" Ms. Burns says. She took part in a rally outside the 4th Precinct last week to boost a ballot initiative that would establish a new civilian commission on police accountability. \"We want systemic change.\"\n\nAs competing proposals to shape the future of the police department vie for public attention, activists and organizers recognize that the trial's verdict could have profound effect on their ability to recruit and retain supporters. Trahern Crews, the lead organizer of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, suggests that a conviction would prove at once cathartic and galvanizing for people of color in Minneapolis and beyond.\n\n\"I feel like the whole city is on edge, because the world is watching us,\" he says. \"It's one of the most important trials in the history of the country, and we need a win. The Black community needs a win. A guilty verdict will reenergize us.\"\n\nNine members of the Minneapolis City Council appeared on a stage in a city park less than two weeks after Mr. Floyd's death last spring. The words \"Defund Police\" adorned the front of the platform, and the officials vowed to \"end policing as we know it,\" drawing cheers from the hundreds of people gathered.\n\nThe pledge earned national headlines and praise from progressive activists, who had pressed council members to take decisive action as the city reeled and raged. Days later, the 13-member council unanimously passed a resolution to initiate a yearlong process to \"create a transformative new model for cultivating safety\" - a signal that pursuing reforms would require patience as much as persistence.\n\nThe resolution received far less notice, and then as now, Council Member Phillipe Cunningham, who addressed the crowd in the park in June, emphasized the difference between proclaiming change and forging policy.\n\n\"I believe we need to reimagine public safety, but defunding the police is a transition - it's not an end goal or a strategy,\" he says. \"Just taking money away from police isn't enough because public safety involves much more than policing.\"\n\nHis perspective tracks with popular opinion in Minneapolis. A poll conducted in August found that almost three-fourths of residents favored redirecting a portion of police funding to mental health, drug treatment, and other social services. At the same time, 60% of respondents overall - and 75% of Black respondents - opposed or expressed uncertainty about reducing the size of the force.\n\nNational polls show a similar preference for revamping rather than gutting police departments, and Minneapolis officials began to recalibrate public safety resources in December. The council passed a measure that maintained the maximum number of officers at 888 while slicing $8 million from the department's budget to expand the Office of Violence Prevention and fund crisis response teams.\n\n\"To say that we have to either add more police and jails or we have to solve racism - that those are the only two options - doesn't reflect the realities of creating policy,\" says Mr. Cunningham, who co-wrote the initiative. \"You have to live in the nuance.\"\n\nProgressive activists counter that officials have failed to fulfill the expectations they raised with their declaration in the park, and with reform caught in the gears of bureaucracy , the city has endured a spike in homicides, robberies, and other violent crimes.\n\n\"There was a worldwide outcry to dismantle the police,\" says Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney who leads the Racial Justice Network. \"Ten months later, it's clear our elected officials did not take that seriously.\"\n\nMs. Levy Armstrong, former president of the local NAACP chapter, recalls protesting Mr. Clark's death at the hands of police in 2015. She says city leaders largely ignored the pleas of communities of color to embrace new public safety strategies and divert more money to social programs.\n\nThe gulf separating the respective budgets of the police department and the Office of Violence Prevention - $170 million vs. $7.4 million - gives her little reason to hope that the near future will depart from the recent past.\n\n\"If the current system worked,\" she says, \"Derek Chauvin would not have felt comfortable putting his knee on George Floyd's neck at all, let alone for nine minutes.\"\n\nThe council approved an agreement with the state last summer that bans Minneapolis officers from applying chokeholds and strengthens rules that they must intervene when colleagues use excessive force. Yet activists complain that police remain too quick to escalate confrontations. A video emerged last week that showed an officer punching a Black teenager in the head in the confused aftermath of an apparent carjacking.\n\n\"Police keep harming people,\" says JaNaé Bates, communications director with ISAIAH, a statewide network of faith organizations that promotes racial justice. \"That's the elephant in the room - we can't get the safety results we want with the group of people we hire to do the job.\"\n\nMinneapolis officials agreed earlier this month to pay $27 million to Mr. Floyd's family to settle a civil lawsuit over his death. For D.A. Bullock, a Minneapolis organizer and filmmaker, the true worth of the payment - one of the largest of its kind in the country's history - will be revealed by the city's commitment to preventing police-involved deaths.\n\n\"The $27 million is not enough value for a life,\" he says. \"So the value will be making sure that what happened to George Floyd never happens again.\"\n\nThe intersection where police killed Mr. Floyd soon evolved into a memorial site that provided the backdrop to a city's sorrow. Visitors wrote chalk messages of grief, anger, and resolve on the pavement and laid flowers beneath a mural of Mr. Floyd. They came to mourn, to commune with one another, to find solace among neighbors and strangers alike.\n\nThe displays of comity have since given way to a physical and emotional hollowness. In the four-block area now known as George Floyd Square, barricades impede vehicles from entering and activists occupy checkpoints to keep out police.\n\nOfficers bypass the so-called autonomous zone to avoid provoking confrontations. Their absence has coincided with a surge in gun violence in and around the square, including a fatal shooting earlier this month. The bloodshed has devastated the area's shops and restaurants.\n\nDwight Alexander, who co-owns Smoke in the Pit, estimates business at his BBQ joint has plunged 75% in recent months. He has heard from longtime customers who fear walking into the square and from delivery drivers turned away at the barriers. He and other business owners accuse city officials and police of abandoning the neighborhood.\n\n\"I've been running this place for nine years. Cops used to come by to see how we were doing, but not a single person from the city has checked on me since all this started,\" Mr. Alexander says. He thumped a fist against his chest. \"They left me!\"\n\nNext door at Just Turkey, owner Sam Willis, who opened his restaurant in October, echoes the lament. He has talked with Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo about the plight of businesses and residents - a screenshot on his phone shows him on a Zoom call with them - and has waited for the city to act. Both officials have announced that the autonomous zone will remain largely closed off until after Mr. Chauvin's trial.\n\n\"Everybody here wants justice for George Floyd and wants this to be a place that always honors his memory,\" says Mr. Willis, the father of four children. \"But we also have families to support, and it's a struggle right now.\"\n\nThe increase in violent crime in the neighborhoods around the square mirrors a citywide trend and overlaps with a steep loss in police personnel. Following last year's upheaval over Mr. Floyd's death - rioters torched the 3rd Precinct building and destroyed or damaged 1,500 businesses - the department endured a wave of retirements and resignations, and dozens of other officers have taken extended leaves.\n\nThe exodus has reduced the force by some 200 officers and prompted a lawsuit from a group of residents who seek to force the city to beef up the department to fight the rise in violence. Last month, the City Council approved a $6.4 million funding request from police officials to add dozens more officers, a decision that reform advocates cast as short-sighted.\n\n\"You shouldn't have to choose between no police and violent police,\" Ms. Levy Armstrong says. \"There needs to be other ways to ensure community safety.\"\n\nVoters could have an opportunity to weigh alternatives this fall. A coalition of progressive groups has launched a petition drive for a ballot initiative that would replace the police force with a new Department of Public Safety by amending the city charter.\n\nA similar amendment that could appear on the November ballot, proposed by Mr. Cunningham and two other council members, would include a law enforcement division within the new public safety agency. Both proposals treat violence prevention as a matter of public health and put forth a concept of community safety that relies less on force and more on trust.\n\n\"We can't let everything we do be steeped in fear,\" Mr. Bullock says. \"That's what has gotten us to this point with policing in America. We don't have to dial 911 because somebody's music is too loud.\"\n\nA convenience store clerk called police after Mr. Floyd tried to buy cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, setting in motion the arrest that led to his death. Mr. Cunningham, who has assured activists that the council will drop its proposal if the petition drive succeeds, wants residents to reimagine public safety as a kind of community contract that they keep with each other, rather than placing the entire onus on cops.\n\n\"People have been socially conditioned to believe that the police are the answer to almost every safety question that comes up in their lives,\" he says. \"That's what we're pushing back against.\"\n\nRacial justice advocates regard Mr. Chauvin's trial as a chance to turn their aspirations into policy. Mike Griffin's immersion in police reform began with the death of Jamar Clark six years ago. An electoral organizer with Community Change Action, a national advocacy group, he senses the momentum shifting at last.\n\n\"Progress happens slowly - that's the history of this country,\" he says. \"But there's not been a moment like this. George Floyd's death fundamentally changed the conversation on police in this country. This is a 21st-century civil rights movement.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Tim Walz.\n\nLoading...\n\nMay 25, 2021, 1:31 p.m. ET | Minneapolis\n\nThe intersection where George Floyd took his final breaths is to be transformed Tuesday into an outdoor festival on the anniversary of his death, with food, children's activities, and a long list of musical performers.\n\n\"We're going to be turning mourning into dancing,\" rapper Nur-D tweeted. \"We're going to be celebrating 365 days of strength in the face of injustice.\"\n\nMr. Floyd, who was Black, died on Memorial Day 2020 after then-Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, pinning him to the ground for about 9 1/2 minutes. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted last month of murder and faces sentencing June 25. Three other fired officers still face trial.\n\nThe site of Mr. Floyd's death, 38th and Chicago, was taken over by activists soon after and remains barricaded to traffic. The \"Rise and Remember George Floyd\" celebration, including a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m., caps several days of marches, rallies, and panel discussions about his death and where America is in confronting racial discrimination.\n\nFamily members of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Daunte Wright, and other Black men slain by police gathered for a discussion about the state of policing in the U.S. and racial inequities in the frequency of fatal encounters with law enforcement. The families also discussed the role of lawmakers in making changes to hold police accountable and how community members can support the loved ones of those killed by police.\n\n\"You don't have to actually lose a child in order for you to have that passion,\" said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. \"We need allies, we need people to support us and lift us up when we've fallen down and when you all have fallen down we need to lift you all up.\"\n\nMany members of the Floyd family are scheduled to be in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, in a private meeting with President Joe Biden, who called family members after the Chauvin verdict and pledged to continue fighting for racial justice.\n\nFloyd family attorney Ben Crump said he hoped Mr. Biden will renew his support for policing reform named for George Floyd that would ban chokeholds and no-knock police raids and create a national registry for officers disciplined for serious misconduct.\n\n\"Now is time to act,\" Mr. Crump said Tuesday on CNN. \"Not just talk but act.\"\n\nMr. Floyd's brother Philonise, appearing alongside Mr. Crump, said he thinks about George \"all the time.\"\n\n\"My sister called me at 12 o'clock last night and said 'This is the day our brother left us,'\" he said, adding: \"I think things have changed. I think it is moving slowly but we are making progress.\"\n\nNur-D, whose real name is Matt Allen, took to the Minneapolis streets in the days after Mr. Floyd's death, often providing medical assistance to protesters who were shot or gassed in confrontations with police. He eventually founded an organization, Justice Frontline Aid, to support safe protest.\n\nHe described the past year as \"like we've lived 20 years inside of one\" and hoped that people would feel \"honesty and a real sense of togetherness\" during Tuesday's celebration at what's informally known as George Floyd Square.\n\n\"If you're angry, you can be angry. If you're sad, you can be sad,\" Nur-D said in a follow-up interview. \"If you're feeling some sense of joy over the verdict and some sort of like step in the right direction, and you want to celebrate that, do that as well.\"\n\nThe event was organized by the George Floyd Global Memorial. Angela Harrelson, an aunt of Mr. Floyd's and a member of the board of directors, said the organization has stockpiled 3,000 items surrounding Mr. Floyd's death - things like artwork left behind in the square - and will display some of them in a pop-up gallery.\n\nThe event was due to start at 1 p.m., the same time Gov. Tim Walz asked Minnesotans to pause for a moment of silence to honor Mr. Floyd. Mr. Walz asked that the moment last for 9 minutes, 29 seconds - the length of time that prosecutors say Mr. Chauvin had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck.\n\nMr. Walz's proclamation says Mr. Chauvin's guilty verdict was a step in the right direction, \"but our work to dismantle systemic racism and discrimination has not ended. True justice for George Floyd will come only through real, systemic change to prevent acts like this from happening again - when every member of every community, no matter their race, is safe, valued, and protected.\"\n\nThe state's seemingly polite exterior, exemplified by the nickname \"Minnesota Nice,\" has long concealed some of the country's worst racial disparities - especially when it comes to employment, housing and education.\n\nSamuel Myers Jr., director of the Roy Wilkins Center for Human Relations and Social Justice at the University of Minnesota, has spent years documenting what he calls \"The Minnesota Paradox.\"\n\n•The graduation rate for high school students hit a historic high of nearly 84% in 2019. But for Black students, it was below 70%. And while two-thirds of white students met state reading proficiency standards, only a third of Black students did.\n\n•Minnesota had the highest rate of home ownership in the nation at nearly 73% according to a 2013 report. For U.S.-born Black Minnesota residents, it was just 26%.\n\n•The median household income for Minnesota in 2019 was $77,000 for white households and about $42,000 for Black households.\n\nResidents are still debating whether anything has changed - or will.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He walked across the street and sat down on an empty park bench, and from that vantage point, he looked back and ahead, to the struggle then and now for racial justice in America.\n\nHe recalled a recent trip to Selma, Alabama, with his wife, who grew up there. They visited the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where in 1965 state troopers and sheriff's deputies armed with tear gas and billy clubs attacked peaceful demonstrators marching in support of voting rights for African Americans. \"Bloody Sunday,\" as the confrontation became known, marked a seminal moment in the civil rights movement and prodded Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act that year.\n\n\"Walking onto that bridge - that was powerful,\" says Mr. Rogers, a former grade-school teacher. \"You could feel the history of what those marchers achieved.\"\n\nLaw enforcement violence against peaceful demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 shocked the U.S. and sparked social change. Is George Floyd's death at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis a similar inflection point?\n\nA Connecticut native who moved to Minneapolis in the early 1980s, he attended the memorial here for Mr. Floyd last week on behalf of the Christian church where he serves as an elder. He heard the Rev. Al Sharpton deliver a stirring eulogy for Mr. Floyd, the Black security guard who died on Memorial Day under the knee of a white police officer as other officers held him down.\n\n\"What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country - in education, in health services, and in every area of American life,\" Mr. Sharpton told mourners, his voice rising. \"It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say, 'Get your knee off our necks!'\"\n\nThe viral video of Mr. Floyd's death ignited outrage and massive protests in Minneapolis that spread across the country, creating a groundswell that could represent the start of the nation's largest grassroots movement since civil rights and the Vietnam War. The prospect inspires cautious hope among residents that their city might emerge from an uprising born of tragedy as the Selma of the North.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a step forward,\" Mr. Rogers says. \"Change takes time, and I'm not sure everybody is ready to change. Black people - we're ready. What we need is for everyone to stay involved and stay passionate.\"\n\nCivil rights luminaries, religious leaders, and politicians joined Mr. Floyd's family for the memorial to commemorate his life and call for racial equality. Outside the sanctuary, a sound system carried the words of Mr. Sharpton and other speakers to hundreds of people gathered on the streets and in a nearby park. The demonstrators bore messages of solidarity - \"Rest in Power George,\" \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"I Can't Breathe\" - on T-shirts, face masks, and cardboard signs.\n\nThe deep tensions between people of color and the city's predominantly white police force exploded after a bystander's video surfaced of Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Mr. Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. Shonda Henderson, who has raised her six children in Minneapolis, warns her two teenage sons to avoid cops whenever possible, a concern rooted in the department's reputation for abusive behavior .\n\n\"I want to see the police violence against us stop and law enforcement start working for us,\" says Ms. Henderson, a housekeeper at a downtown hotel. The demographics of the protesters - as much as the number and size of recent rallies - give her reason to think the emotion of the moment could evolve into a sustained movement.\n\n\"What's different this time is I'm seeing everybody out here - Caucasians, Asians, Latinos. It's not just African Americans,\" she says. \"We're all sticking up for each other and realizing that these issues of equality affect every one of us.\"\n\nMillennials and Generation Z have supplied much of the energy and momentum behind the demand for racial justice in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Mariana Noyola, who will enter ninth grade this fall, convinced her parents to attend the gathering outside the memorial service.\n\n\"It's scary to be African American in America. We're looked at differently, we're seen as dangerous, we feel more threatened,\" she says. \"Other people feel like our Blackness is some kind of weapon.\"\n\nThe teenager sounded weary beyond her years as she recited the names of Black men killed by police in Minneapolis and other cities the past few years: Jamar Clark, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Michael Brown.\n\n\"We don't want this to keep happening,\" she says. \"So we're making sure that we're heard and we're seen so that our future doesn't look like the past.\"\n\nThe looting and destruction of hundreds of businesses hindered the first days of protests. Along Lake Street in South Minneapolis, one of the most racially diverse and hardest-hit stretches in the city, many of the small-business owners are people of color and include immigrants from Somalia, Laos, and an array of other countries.\n\nMarvin Applewhite launched a GoFundMe campaign that raised more than $53,000 to provide cleanup services for businesses in the area. He considers his multicultural, multiethnic team of volunteers reflective of the communal will to remedy racial friction.\n\n\"George Floyd's death has brought people together who I've never seen coming together here,\" he says. \"And now they're coming together across the country.\"\n\nNear the end of his eulogy for Mr. Floyd last week, Mr. Sharpton declaimed, \"You changed the world, George. We going to keep marching, George. We going to keep fighting, George.\"\n\nShae Noyola, Mariana's mother, added a coda intended for the city and country alike. \"Don't want change,\" she says. \"Make change.\"\n\nA shrine has bloomed at the intersection where George Floyd gasped his final breaths outside a corner grocery store. A mural of him adorns one of the shop's exterior walls, his head encircled by a halo of names of people killed by police. Beneath the painting lies a welter of flower bouquets, handmade placards, photos, and other offerings of anguish, anger, and unity.\n\nAround the corner, marking the spot of his death, a chalk drawing on the pavement shows a human figure with angel's wings.\n\nVisitors by the hundreds eddied through the site on the day of Mr. Floyd's memorial as the mood drifted between block party and open-air wake. Smoke from barbecue grills swirled in the air while volunteers served free food and distributed donated goods. A series of speakers and musicians took to a stage erected in the middle of the street. Almost every one of them yelled out to the crowd, \"What's his name?\" Each time the reply arrived like cracks of thunder: \"George! Floyd!\"\n\nHere, at the junction of grief and catharsis, Lorraine Gurley felt at once downcast and uplifted. Thirty years ago, responding to a report of a neighborhood party turned unruly, a white Minneapolis cop fatally shot her unarmed brother in the back.\n\nThe case provoked racial animus and local protests. But unlike the four officers involved in Mr. Floyd's death, the patrolman who killed Tycel Nelson neither faced criminal charges nor lost his job, ascending to the rank of lieutenant over the ensuing two decades.\n\nMs. Gurley, a pastor at a church on the city's north side, wonders whether Mr. Floyd would be alive if the city had imposed reforms on the department after her brother's shooting. She wants the next three decades of policing in Minneapolis and across the country to bear little semblance to the past three.\n\n\"There has been so much frustration, so much sorrow, so much loss and death in the Black community. We have to change the system,\" she says. A message written in chalk on the pavement behind her read, \"Together We Will Change The World.\"\n\n\"All the things we wish could've happened when my baby brother died - that's what we hope will happen now.\"\n\nThe pressure exerted by the protests has begun to alter city policy. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council vowed this week to replace the police department with a new public safety system, and the police chief announced the department's withdrawal from contract negotiations with the officers union.\n\nAt the same time, the demands for reform in Minneapolis and other cities extend beyond revamping law enforcement. The surging movement encompasses a broader desire to redress racial inequality in employment and education, in housing and health care, in the culture of everyday American life.\n\nA reputation for liberal politics and policies contrasts with wide economic disparities in Minneapolis between people of color and white residents, who make up about 60% of the population. The enduring inequities - magnified by the coronavirus pandemic - raise questions among some Black activists about the city's potential to equal Selma's legacy.\n\nShanene Herbert runs the healing justice program for the Minneapolis office of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization that promotes social equality. Reacting to large corporations in Minnesota offering statements of support and pledges of funding for the cause of social justice, she says, \"Why now? Do you need your name attached to it? Will you leave when the cameras go?\"\n\nYet if experience informs her skepticism, the huge wave of young adults powering the protests here and nationwide gives her a sense of optimism. \"Our younger generation doesn't have the patience of the older generations,\" Ms. Herbert says. \"They've seen enough. They've been traumatized and they're not willing to wait for change.\"\n\nThe urgency cuts across racial lines. Ella Masters grew up attending Trinity Lutheran Church in South Minneapolis, where last week organizers set up a distribution site for donated goods in the parking lot. The area's two grocery stores and largest department store were among several businesses damaged or destroyed by rioters.\n\nMs. Masters and her partner, Cameron Kinghorn, drove to the church from their home a few miles away to donate laundry detergent, diapers, and other essential items requested by organizers. Without ignoring the toll on businesses, they credit the scale and duration of the protests for forcing the city to reexamine its relationship with race.\n\n\"A human life is more important than property,\" says Ms. Masters, who is white. \"We need people to get out of their comfort zone and start acting to save lives. Good intentions aren't enough.\"\n\nMr. Kinghorn, who is biracial, related that the recent upheaval has nudged some of his friends and acquaintances to reevaluate their passive advocacy for equality. \"They're looking for ways they can actively help,\" he says. He hopes more of his cohort will step forward to push Minneapolis in the direction of Selma as a historical symbol of racial justice.\n\n\"I don't know if we can ever reach that level,\" he says. \"But I think there's a chance, and I would not have said that a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Derek Chauvin sentenced to just over 20 years for violating George Floyd's federal civil rights\n\nDerek Chauvin was sentenced to just more than 20 years in prison Thursday, nearly seven months after he pleaded guilty to federal charges that he violated George Floyd's civil rights when he knelt on Floyd's neck for 91⁄2 minutes as he was detaining him in May 2020 .\n\nFederal prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson to sentence Chauvin to 25 years, on the high end of the 20- to 25-year range of the plea agreement, saying Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer and acted callously.\n\nThe defense had asked for 20 years, saying Chauvin was remorseful for what he did and that he has accepted responsibility.\n\nMagnuson sentenced Chauvin to 21 years in prison, with credit for the time he has already served.\n\nChauvin is already serving a 221⁄2-year sentence after he was found guilty of second- and third-degree murder , as well as second-degree manslaughter, in April 2021 in a state case for the death of Floyd. His federal sentence will be served concurrently.\n\nChauvin initially pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, but he changed his plea in December. At the time, he also admitted guilt in a separate federal indictment in connection with allegations that he deprived a 14-year-old boy of his civil rights in an encounter in September 2017.\n\nThe guilty plea allowed Chauvin to avoid another high-profile trial.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nBA.5, now dominant U.S. variant, may pose the biggest threat to immune protection yet\n\nGeorgia Guidestones monument is destroyed after explosion\n\n'This is America': Biden awards Medal of Freedom to Simone Biles, John McCain and 15 others\n\nChauvin spoke briefly before he was sentenced, telling the Floyd family that he wished them \"all the best in their life.\"\n\nThree other former officers at the scene of Floyd's death - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - were convicted in February on federal charges of depriving Floyd of his civil rights . Kueng and Thao were also convicted of not intervening to stop Chauvin from using excessive force. Their sentencing dates have not been scheduled.\n\nKueng and Thao also face a state trial set for October on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lane pleaded guilty to the state charges of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, avoiding a trial. A charge of aiding and abetting second-degree murder was dismissed as part of the plea deal.\n\nThe four officers' encounter with Floyd in May 2020 was captured on video recorded by a bystander, a traffic camera and the officers' bodycams. On the recordings, Thao is seen standing between onlookers as his fellow officers pin Floyd to the pavement. Lane and Kueng are on top of Floyd as Chauvin applies pressure to Floyd's neck. The officers had been responding to a call from a convenience store about a counterfeit bill.\n\nFloyd's killing at the hands of police spurred protests against systemic racism and police brutality around the world.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Former police officer Derek Chauvin pleads guilty to federal civil rights charges in George Floyd's death\n\nFormer Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges of violating George Floyd's civil rights , averting a trial but likely extending the time he is already spending behind bars on a state conviction.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was convicted this spring of state murder and manslaughter charges for pinning his knee against Floyd's neck during a May 25, 2020, arrest as the Black man said he couldn't breathe Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in that case.\n\nThe federal charges included two counts alleging that Chauvin deprived Floyd of his rights by kneeling on his neck as he was handcuffed and not resisting, and then failing to provide medical care.\n\nChauvin appeared in person Wednesday for the change of plea hearing in an orange short-sleeve prison shirt and was led into and out of the court in handcuffs. He said \"Guilty, your honor\" to confirm his pleas, and acknowledged that he was guilty of the acts alleged in the charges.\n\nWith parole and presuming good behavior, Chauvin is expected to actually serve about 15 years of his state sentence behind bars. Any federal sentence would run at the same time as the state sentence, and defendants serve about 85 percent of federal sentences presuming good behavior. That means if the judge gives Chauvin the maximum 25 years requested, he would likely serve about six years and three months beyond his state sentence.\n\nJudge Paul Magnuson didn't set a date for sentencing.\n\nThree other former officers - Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao - were indicted on federal charges alongside Chauvin earlier this year. They are still on course for trial early next year on those charges, with a state trial still to come.\n\nFloyd's arrest and death, which a bystander captured on cellphone video, sparked mass protests nationwide calling for an end to racial inequality and police mistreatment of Black people.\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to violating the rights of a then-14-year-old boy during a 2017 arrest in which he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the boy's neck and upper back while he was prone, handcuffed and not resisting.\n\nSeveral members of Floyd's family were present, as was the then-teenager involved in the 2017 arrest, according to a pool reporter. As they left the courtroom, Floyd's brother Philonise said to Chauvin's 2017 victim: \"It's a good day for justice.\"\n\nNine people appeared to support Chauvin, including family members. He waved and smiled at them as he entered and left the courtroom, according to the pool report.\n\nFloyd's arrest and death, which a bystander captured on cellphone video, sparked mass protests nationwide that called for an end to racial inequality and police mistreatment of Black people.\n\nTo bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe an officer acted under the \"color of law,\" or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights. That's a high legal standard. An accident, bad judgment or simple negligence on the officer's part isn't enough to support federal charges. Prosecutors have to prove the officer knew what he was doing was wrong in that moment but did it anyway.\n\nAccording to evidence in the state case against Chauvin, Kueng and Lane helped restrain the 46-year-old Floyd as he was on the ground - Kueng knelt on Floyd's back and Lane held down Floyd's legs. Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint.\n\nAll four former officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further. The first count against Chauvin alleges he violated Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure and unreasonable force by a police officer when he kept his knee on Floyd's neck, even after Floyd was unresponsive.\n\nThe second count alleges Chauvin willfully deprived Floyd of liberty without due process, including the right to be free from \"deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.\"\n\nIn the 2017 case involving the then-14-year-old boy, Chauvin is charged with depriving the boy, who was handcuffed and not resisting, of his right to be free of unreasonable force when he held him by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the boy's neck and upper back while he was in a prone position.\n\nAccording to a police report from that 2017 encounter, Chauvin wrote that the teen resisted arrest and after the teen, whom he described as 6-foot-2 and about 240 pounds, was handcuffed, Chauvin \"used body weight to pin\" him to the floor. The boy was bleeding from the ear and needed two stitches.\n\nThat encounter was one of several mentioned in state court filings that prosecutors said showed Chauvin had used neck or head and upper body restraints seven times before dating back to 2014, including four times state prosecutors said he went too far and held the restraints \"beyond the point when such force was needed under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe other three former officers are still expected to go to trial on federal charges in January, and they face state trial on aiding and abetting counts in March.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden signs police reform executive order on anniversary of George Floyd's death\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at reforming policing practices on the second anniversary of the death of George Floyd .\n\nThe order creates a national registry of officers fired for misconduct and encourages state and local police to tighten restrictions on chokeholds and so-called no-knock warrants. It also restricts the transfer of military equipment to law enforcement agencies and mandates all federal agents wear activated body cameras.\n\nBiden had been pushing Congress to pass more comprehensive police reform legislation, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But after the legislation failed to garner bipartisan support, the White House began crafting its own action last year. Biden called again on Congress again to take action before signing the order.\n\n\"I know progress can be slow and frustrating, and there's a concern that the reckoning on race inspired two years ago is beginning to fade,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Today, we're acting. We're showing that speaking out matters, being engaged matters, and that the work of our time, healing the soul of this nation, is ongoing and unfinished and requires all of us never to give up.

      "text": "Two Years  After George Floyd, Black Leaders Reflect On Change\n\nBy Jared Council\n\nOn May 25, 2020, George Floyd died before our eyes as a police officer knelt on his neck for approximately 9 minutes on a street in Minneapolis. Had Darnella Frazier, then 17, not captured the murder on her cell phone and posted it to Facebook, Floyd would have been yet another Black man to die in police custody - a statistic. Instead, George Floyd became a powerful symbol of persistent inequality and systemic injustice against Black Americans and a wake-up call for all. The response was historic - from the scores of leaders making forceful statements every day about racial justice to the $50 billion that U.S. companies pledged (but not necessarily paid) to support Black communities. To understand the complexities of where we stand as a nation, though, look no further than the racially motivated mass murder at a Buffalo grocery store on May 14. In an effort to capture the reality of being Black in America, we decided that we wanted to hear from leaders in the community. Here are some of their reflections on the post-Floyd era.\n\nMcKesson is executive director of Campaign Zero, which works with policymakers across the U.S. to reduce police violence.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death really did reshape the conversation about police violence. I was in the streets in 2014, and we fought people for years to get them to believe that there was a problem. When George Floyd was killed, people just got it.\n\nTwo years later, we've accomplished a lot. We've helped enact laws in 19 states around the use of force. Every single state now has restricted or banned no-knock raids - we wrote those laws. We did the first repeal of the law enforcement officer bill of rights in the country's history in Maryland. This work is not sexy, but it will save people's lives.\n\nWe spend a lot of our time battling misinformation from police, who are trying to convince elected officials that our proposals make them less safe. Early on, policymakers stopped ceding ground to police. Over the past year, the uptick in crime hasn't helped our cause.\n\nI don't have any comment about the 'defund the police' slogan. I don't see any win in commenting. I will say that part of our work as activists is not to be so arrogant as to believe that the only way to enter is the way we enter. I can enter from 'defund' and it doesn't stress me out. Some people can't enter from 'defund.' That doesn't mean that they don't love Black people and don't care about our work. When I talk to my aunt - she's in Baltimore, where there's a lot of crime - I can't talk about defunding the police. Because she's not hearing me. And if she doesn't hear me, then I can't do any of my best work.\n\nRalph is a Tony award-winning actress, best known for her roles on TV hits Abbott Elementary, Moesha and Ray Donovan .\n\nWhen I entered the film industry as a teenager in the 1970s, I remember Sidney Poitier gifting me a makeup box with everything I'd need to do my makeup. This was because, once I left the support of our set, many stylists on other sets wouldn't know how to make up a Black actress. He apologized that the industry did not have much to offer me because he felt, with my talent, I deserved more.\n\nWith that in mind, I didn't expect much change to occur in the entertainment industry after George Floyd's death. I am a child of the '60s. I saw horrible things. So when the incident happened with George Floyd, I thought, 'Oh, here we go.'\n\nBut I do see change. And I've been pleasantly surprised. Now, when I walk onto sets, I see more young, Black faces. I see hair and makeup artists hired to work with Black talent and others. And I see members of Generations Z and X promoting mental health while fighting for racial justice and equality, like my son, Etienne Maurice. He started a nonprofit called WalkGood LA to help people of color heal from the anger they felt after the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.\n\nThere is so much more work to be done, specifically around policing and requiring body-worn cameras to keep officers accountable. What has taken 300 years to solidify itself in the thread of our country cannot be undone in two years. We've got more work that we must and can do.\n\nWells is co-chair of the litigation department at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, chairman emeritus of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and one of the country's top trial lawyers.\n\nI try to be optimistic but it's tempered by the reality of history and current events. At this moment in time, the underpinnings of our democracy are under attack. There are formal efforts to suppress Black voting rights and a real possibility that the Supreme Court will ban affirmative action in higher education next term. We have income inequality across racial groups and many Black youth trapped in subpar schools while the problems of mass incarceration are only being addressed at the margins.\n\nI was born in 1950 and came of age during the civil rights movement. If somebody had told me at 18 that we would still be fighting in 2022 with such intensity about violence against Black men and women, I'm not sure I would have believed it.\n\nI have come to believe that the struggle for racial equality will continue over many generations. Progress is an aspirational goal, but it is not guaranteed. What is scary is that you now have people saying that we should not be discussing slavery or Jim Crow in our schools because it is uncomfortable. Until this nation, both Black and white, is willing to have an honest discussion about its history of systemic and institutionalized racism, we are going to find it difficult to make real progress.\n\nThe George Floyd moment for my generation was Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy who was murdered and hung in Mississippi because he allegedly whistled at a white woman. The people who lynched him were acquitted by an all-white jury. Many Black children of my generation were drilled on how you could be murdered for the mere fact of being a Black person in the wrong place at the wrong time. That lesson continued with George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. Unlike in the Emmett Till case, their murderers were convicted. But the violence continues, as we saw earlier this month in Buffalo. I want to believe that we are mourning this tragedy together, that the outrage will lead to change. You have to try to temper your frustration and despair with hope and optimism.\n\nSaint John is a Hall of Fame marketing executive, author, entrepreneur and the former global chief marketing officer at Netflix.\n\nA few days after George Floyd was murdered, I had to present at a roundtable of CMOs. Each of us was asked to present three things that we thought were important for our audiences or for our companies. Everybody was saying all these amazing things from very diverse points of view. About halfway through, though, I realized I didn't care about any of those things at that moment. When it was my turn, I said, \"There are things I want for us as a community of C-suite executives. Number one: Be enraged. Number two: Be enraged. Number three: Be enraged.\" I said it with my voice shaking and a cry at the back of my throat.\n\nIn that moment, I didn't care about the appearance of being the angry Black woman. I wanted everybody to see it and ask themselves why they weren't enraged, too. I hadn't challenged my own peers in that kind of visceral way before.\n\nPrior to Floyd's murder, we hadn't had companies make public statements about anything, really - except for something like a natural disaster. But we hadn't had companies make statements about racial reckoning. That was not a thing. And to be quite honest, I was so shocked by it.\n\nI think there is a responsibility for companies to do more to advance racial equity. I understand why we are very sensitive to performative action. But even if a company is performative to whatever degree, they're still laying a foundation to build on. It is our job as a society to make sure that we keep that performance accountable. If we think it's performative, put some pressure against it. It's just like science. If I put pressure against this thing and it's actually a facade, it will fall.\n\nMason Jr. is a Grammy-nominated record producer, songwriter, movie producer and CEO of The Recording Academy.\n\nI think people have an awareness that they should have had before but didn't. Many come to me, asking how they can help. Awkward as that sometimes is, they're speaking from the heart. I'm very conscious of how I move as someone who hopefully can open the door for others. Hopefully, we can set a tone that then makes a change that can last and have impact.\n\nWhen I'm on a Zoom call, talking to a studio about a film, and half the faces I see on screen are people of color, I know those people are going to rise through the ranks at that company. One might become a chief creative officer or CEO, and that's going to trickle down to have a tremendous impact on the content that those studios produce. That will then trickle down to have a tremendous impact on the people who watch it, which might shape the opinions and perspectives those consumers have about a certain race or gender.\n\nThat's going to be ultimately what changes the world and changes behavior and changes the hearts and minds of people. That's why I love my job and why I love making art. By the time people watch it or hear it or listen to it or dance to it or sing it, they're getting a dose of empathy and understanding.\n\nWilliams is cofounder and CEO of Cadre, a technology-driven real estate platform that aims to make commercial real estate accessible to a wider number of investors.\n\nWhat has changed since George Floyd's murder? Conversations like this have changed. Personally, this was not a discussion that I was comfortable having a couple years ago. And I don't think a lot of folks in the media were comfortable having it either.\n\nI've realized that I need to be more of a multidimensional leader. It's not enough just to make sure we're growing and building the leading platform for individuals to access real estate. I also need to talk about the communities we're investing in, and start thinking more about my employees, my team and the communities they came from.\n\nThe biggest things that haven't changed since two years ago are the numbers related to underrepresented minorities being board members, founders and CEOs. In some cases, you're seeing things go backward in terms of minority representation and control in governance at large companies.\n\nInstitutional investors like pensions and university endowments play a huge role in how capital gets allocated. They're not pounding the table and asking the venture capital funds they invest in, 'What does your portfolio look like today?' They're not asking VCs, 'How many Black partners do you have?'\n\nSalvant (left) and  LaRon (right).\n\nLaRon and Salvant are the co-founders of Squire Technologies, which provides software and services to barber shops nationwide.\n\nLARON: After George Floyd died, there was a lot more attention paid to the lack of funding that Black founders receive, relative to founders [who are] white and other races. There was more attention to the challenges that Black entrepreneurs experience. Prior to 2020 I think that was something that was talked about in Black circles but not so much outside. It sparked a dialogue. Did that dialogue and awareness translate into change that can be tracked and traced? I don't know to what extent that's happened.\n\nSALVANT: As African-American founders, the more successful we are, the more we give other people chances. Investors and people are greedy and that trumps everything. If they're making money with you, they invest more and look for similar assets to invest in. The responsibility we have is to be as successful as possible, and hopefully our success brings more opportunity in the future.\n\nLARON: I don't think the onus should be on Black people, frankly, to fix these problems. These are American issues. America needs to solve these issues. I think it's good to have the conversation, but not just with Black founders. It's as much of a white issue - more of a white issue, frankly. It'll be interesting to see how white founders deal with this. How are they responding? What are they saying?\n\nConnerly is president of the American Civil Rights Institute, a group critical of affirmative action programs, and a former University of California regent.\n\nWhen George Floyd was murdered, my reaction was one of shock and disbelief - disbelief that law enforcement had allowed such brutal tactics to intrude into the everyday practices of their officers. I did not see Floyd's murder as a racial interaction. That was instantly the characterization of it by many, but I did not see it that way. And to this day, I don't really see it that way.\n\nI think that, as a society, we are so obsessed with race that we look for it often. There are those who have views that are contrary to mine who manufacture that perception. It is almost as if it is in their best interest, based on their ideological view or their station in life, to identify transactions among us as being racial.\n\nIf we want to get beyond race, then we should get beyond race. That's part of what I thought the election of Senator Barack Obama as President Barack Obama was about: post-racial. Not a country of Black and white, red America, blue America. But an America, post-racial. We didn't move in that direction, but I'm still - at 83 almost - trying to gallop toward that before I leave.\n\nTiafoe is the 27th-ranked men's tennis player in the world and the only Black American male in the ATP Tour's top 100 rankings.\n\nAt the time of Floyd's death, I was one of the few Black American tennis players. When I made it to the fourth round of the U.S. Open a few months later, I came out with a Black Lives Matter mask and shirt. The fact that the U.S. Open let that happen was unbelievable. I felt like my guys were definitely behind me. To speak about racism and Floyd's murder on such a big platform. It was huge.\n\nI would like to encourage more people who look like me to play the game of tennis. That would be great for the sport. It comes down to people in power to move the needle. All you need is a basketball and hoop to play basketball and all you need is a field and a football to play football. There's no stringing rackets, no shoes, no certain clothing needed, no traveling outside your community.\n\nThere definitely has been a shift in the right direction. Black people are doing much more for their communities, for places where they grew up in - at least where I'm from in D.C. I see a lot more help in lower-income areas. People are generally trying to do more, showing good representation, showing kids that this is bigger than just what's right around them. But we need to see people of color getting great jobs, getting great opportunities in high places. I definitely like where we're going, but it's a long road ahead for sure.\n\nBuolamwini, whose groundbreaking work on AI bias earned her a PhD from MIT Media Lab, is founder of the nonprofit research group Algorithmic Justice League.\n\nI started AJL in 2016 to share research on how technology could perpetuate colorism, racism and other forms of discrimination. When George Floyd was murdered, it brought an intense focus on racial disparities and policing practices, including surveillance technologies that we've studied such as facial recognition. So it didn't take long for policymakers, decision-makers and street leaders to reach out to us and ask for advice.\n\nMy organization is opposed to the use of technology for mass surveillance. The George Floyd video is not an example of Orwellian surveillance, recorded by some higher authority watching over people. Instead, it was sousveillance that's recorded from below by the less powerful who are watching over the authorities as a check on power. It's the young woman who wielded the camera against police brutality in a defiant, brave and visible act. It is important not to conflate an act of resistance with the invasive use of camera networks for mass surveillance. What matters is not the technology but how it's used.\n\nI'm encouraged to see the government be more transparent and seek expert advice on the impact of technology on our communities through increased testing and the creation of the National AI Advisory Committee. But there is so much more to do. The government also needs experiential expertise from those who have been harmed by technology. We need more enforceable rules and regulations of technology that can be used to discriminate, whether it's who gets hired, arrested or prioritized for a kidney transplant.\n\nFloyd's murder underscores for me that racial justice requires algorithmic justice. We cannot have racial justice when technology discriminates against us.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE: Despite Post-Floyd Era Promises, Limited Gains In Racial Equity\n\nWe Asked Black Americans: How Safe Do You Feel Since George Floyd's Murder?

      "text": "Why It's Important To Say George Floyd Was Murdered\n\nBy Shaun Harper\n\nBy Shaun Harper ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nPeople gather at the unveiling of artist Kenny Altidor's memorial portrait of George Floyd - who ... More died 25 May in Minneapolis with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes - painted on a storefront sidewall of CTown Supermarket on July 13, 2020 in Brooklyn, New York. (Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP) / RESTRICTED TO EDITORIAL USE - MANDATORY MENTION OF THE ARTIST UPON PUBLICATION - TO ILLUSTRATE THE EVENT AS SPECIFIED IN THE CAPTION (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt's George Floyd's birthday. He likely would've turned 49 today had Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, not taken his life in May 2020. The horrific 9 minutes, 29 seconds video that teenager Darnella Frazier recorded on her cell phone shows Chauvin's knee pressing Floyd's head to the ground until he died. It was murder. A jury determined so in April 2021.\n\nThere's an extremely frustrating sanitization and minimization of the tragedy that resulted in Floyd's murder. People were heartbroken, understandably angry, and shocked in summer 2020. But not long thereafter, too many slipped into a refusal to explicitly name what they and millions of others saw on Frazier's video.\n\n\"When George Floyd happened...\" and \"after George Floyd...\" is how several leaders and professionals at companies with which I work refer to it. Also, \"in response to George Floyd...\" is a commonly-used preface to summaries of various DEI activities those businesses undertook. These words, as opposed to murder, offer an escape from the reality and intensity of what the murder itself represents. We must call it murder.\n\nIn June 2020, people across the United States and around the world took to the streets in protest. Most seemed outraged. Not all were, though. Some marched with smiles on their faces, then swiftly posted selfies to social media - it seemed they wanted credit for simply showing up. Regardless of their motives for doing so, an unprecedented number of people across racial groups, ages, and geographies united to demand accountability for Chauvin and other cops who kill unarmed Black Americans. And they did so in the midst of a global pandemic. The energy was unlike any other this nation has ever seen in the name of racial justice. Where's that energy now, 27 months later?\n\nAt many companies, white men comprise the overwhelming majority of executives and senior leaders - by a lot. An extraordinarily high number of them did something they'd never done: They sent company-wide emails about race. Most deemed Floyd's murder awful, sickening, and used other similar adjectives. Many called for conversations within their companies and in communities across America, as well as a long-overdue grappling with structural and systemic racism. They acknowledged that Chauvin's murder of Floyd wasn't an isolated tragedy, but is instead connected to longstanding acts of anti-blackness and state-sanctioned violence against Black people. Some went so far as to even affirm in writing that Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn addition to being sent to all employees, those leaders' statements were often publicly disseminated via their personal and business social media accounts, as well as posted to their company websites. In a June 2020 Washington Post op-ed , I wrote that lots of Black employees were skeptical of the seriousness of the words their leaders were conveying at that time. They were even more doubtful of the sustainability of what felt like a bandwagon. Why were they so skeptical? Because many hadn't previously felt their Black lives were valued in their workplaces, most certainly not by the leaders who were sending emails about George Floyd over company listservs.\n\nIt wasn't just leaders. White colleagues were calling and sending emails, text messages, and notes via Slack asking their Black co-workers if they were okay. In a research interview I conducted last week, one Black woman professional said, \"that performativity lasted a maximum of four days.\" All her other Black colleagues in the focus group nodded in agreement. I've heard this repeatedly from Black employees at numerous other companies. They found the outreach particularly odd because much of it came from white co-workers whom they didn't know well, sometimes not at all. It seems it was more about assuaging white guilt about Floyd's murder than it was about truly understanding what Black colleagues needed at that time and ultimately doing those things - at least that's what they tell me.\n\nLeaders who sent the now infamous company-wide George Floyd emails should ask themselves what they've since written to employees about racial justice - not about DEI broadly, but about racism, specifically. White colleagues who awkwardly reached out during the few days that doing so was trendy ought to reflect on the number of times they've since reached out to inquire about how racial stress was affecting their Black colleagues, the last time they engaged in a serious conversation about race inside or outside of their workplaces, the actions they've taken to dismantle systemic racism in their companies and in our broader society, the number of Black people they spend time with outside of work and how often, and what else they've done to advance racial justice since participating in that one march for Black lives immediately following Floyd's murder.\n\nHere's one question for every company that jumped on the 'Black people are suddenly important here' bandwagon: What would most of our Black colleagues say about the seriousness and effectiveness of our demonstrated commitment to their professional success and to racial justice more broadly? There is one way to get answers to this question: Ask Black employees.\n\nIt isn't too late for businesses and people who work in them to do right by Black employees. Workplace racism didn't magically dissipate when those 'I know this is a hard time for Black people' executive emails and slack messages were sent in June 2020. Calling what Chauvin did to Floyd murder could restimulate the emotionality that compelled companies to have first-time dialogues about race and racism 27 months ago.\n\nCourageous conversations, along with corporate reparations, the remediation of racial illiteracy among leaders and business professionals, policy revisions, accountability for individual and institutional racism, and other sustainable anti-racism actions is what was needed then and continues to be needed now. Most companies haven't even attempted to develop and implement a Black employee advancement strategy - that's needed, too.\n\nSanitized, \"when George Floyd happened\" escapism won't get any business anywhere near racial equity or racial justice. The acknowledgement and memory of how Floyd's life ended demands better of us all.\n\nHappy birthday, Mr. Floyd."

(Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images)\n\nMurals memorializing Floyd in at least six cities have been defaced, most recently one just outside of Boston , where the late black man's face and some of his name was scribbled out with white spray paint, but the artist has vowed to repaint it.\n\nA similar scene played out in Long Beach, California , where an image of Floyd outside of a hair salon was covered with blue paint; the artist painted a new version that reportedly is \"graffiti proof.\"\n\nIn Greensboro, North Carolina , an artist recreated a Floyd mural after vandals defaced it with blue spray paint and also wrote \"white power\" over nearby boarded windows.\n\nAn artist in Pensacola, Florida also had to recreate his mural after the original was defaced less than a day after it was painted.\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama , a suspect was arrested for defacing a mural-painting a large \"X\" over Floyd's face-but the owner of the structure containing the mural declined to press charges, saying \"forgiveness needs to be first and foremost\"; the vandalism to the mural was reportedly quickly repaired.\n\nOne of the most egregious defacings happened outside of the U.S., in Dundee, Scotland , where a vandal painted a neo-Nazi symbol over Floyd's face and erased the word \"black\" from \"black lives matter.\"\n\nMurals of Floyd have appeared in cities throughout the U.S. and across the world as protests against police brutality have continued since his death in Minneapolis while being forcibly detained by police on May 25. Some have been created on the boarded up windows of stores, a step many shop owners decided to take after some protests gave way to violence and looting in the week following Floyd's death. Most protests have remained peaceful over the past few days.\n\n\"It is especially heartbreaking that on the day of George Floyd's funeral people without compassion, people without a moral compass would destroy artwork made of love and healing. I am disgusted that the people who deface the artwork walked our streets. They are not welcome here.

As almost every American TV station live-streamed the George Floyd funeral, after he was allegedly killed by a Minneapolis police officer , and sparked protests across the globe, including all 50 states of America.\n\nAt the Minneapolis memorial service, there was a powerful speech by reverend Al Sharpton, moving tributes, the presence of his family, and peaceful gatherings of people in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and all over the world.\n\nThat's not to mention the star-studded front row at the service, where Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart and Ludacris , among others, including Martin Luther King III , were in attendance.\n\nBut who could ignore the artwork in the background of this touching memorial service? While there has been a huge outpour of support from protesters, both online and offline, there has also been a number of artworks , as well, from digital paintings to public art and of course, murals. The background imiage from Floyd's memorial today is based on this very artwork.\n\nThis mural, which ahs been reproduced digitally for the service, was one of the first public artworks (if not the first) by a group of community artists, Cadex Herrera, Greta McLain, and Xena Goldman. The mural, which was painted on the side of a grocery store last week, was just down the street from where Floyd was arrested, the Cup Foods at the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue South.\n\nArtists paint a mural in honor of George Floyd outside of the Minneapolis market where Mr. Floyd was ...

      "text": "4 Years After George Floyd, Giving To Racial Equity Faces Challenges\n\nBy David Bowermaster\n\nBy David Bowermaster ,\n\nContributor.\n\nPeople gather at the unveiling of artist Kenny Altidor's memorial portrait of George Floyd on July ... More 13, 2020 in Brooklyn, New York. (Photo by Angela Weiss / AFP)\n\nThe murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, triggered massive protests around the world against police violence and systemic racism.\n\nThose events, in turn, prompted a surge in pledges from corporations, foundations, and wealthy individuals to advance racial equity in the United States.\n\nFour years after Floyd's death, there are major concerns in the philanthropy and nonprofit worlds that giving to support communities of color has regressed substantially, particularly in the wake of legal challenges to affirmative action and race-based grantmaking in the past two years.\n\nIn this moment of heightened sensitivity and concern, information on what exactly donors are doing when it comes to racial equity also is increasingly scarce.\n\nReliable data about what is happening across the charitable sector has been hard to come by historically, due to a variety of factors. Those include a shortage of philanthropic funding to gather and analyze such information and minimal demand for such data on the part of for-profit entities.\n\nFilling the void has been Candid , a nonprofit that \"provides the most comprehensive data and insights about the social sector,\" according to its website. Candid was formed in 2019 by the merger of Foundation Center and GuideStar, two well-known entities that gathered information from and about nonprofits.\n\nTo track of all the funding announcements and pledges that began emerging in the summer of 2020, Candid launched a special section on Funding for Racial Equity to provide \"continuously updated data\" as well as news and analysis.\n\nBy Candid's estimate, commitments for racial equity soared to $16.5 billion in 2020, up from $5.8 billion in 2019 and $6.1 billion in 2018. Those commitments slipped to $7.9 billion in 2021 but remained above pre-2020 levels, according to Candid.\n\nBen Francisco Maulbeck, a senior fellow at the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity , said the Candid data was widely quoted and analyzed in the sector, including in PRE reports.\n\nIndeed, a 2022 analysis of the initial Candid data by Maulbeck and his PRE colleagues entitled \" Mismatched \" concluded that the amount of racial equity grants that actually went out the door in 2020 was only $3.4 billion, far below the numbers publicly pledged, as many donors were slow to follow through on their commitments. The analysis was based on the partial grants data available at the time and is likely an underestimate, Maulbeck said. But PRE is currently at work on an update now that the grants dataset is nearly complete for 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe decline in commitments and grants that began in 2021 appeared to accelerate in 2022, according to surveys and comments from nonprofit leaders. The drop was due in part to increasing complaints from conservative groups against philanthropy that they perceived as woke and viewed as causing funders to provide excessive support to progressive causes - including racial equity.\n\nThen, last June, the U.S. Supreme Court barred the use of race in college admissions. And in August, a lawsuit filed in Georgia alleged that grants to Black female entrepreneurs made by the Fearless Fund, an Atlanta-based venture capital firm, were discriminatory.\n\nThese and other legal challenges to race-based initiatives raised alarms that funders might grow nervous and further scale back their support for racial equity work to avoid getting sued.\n\nIt is hard to know if those fears have resulted in fewer donations.\n\nCandid stopped updating its data on giving to racial equity in mid-2023. Although its site currently lists information on commitments made in 2022 and 2023, a spokesperson said the data are incomplete due to the time it takes for the IRS to release information from Form 990s, tax filings that require nonprofits to disclose their sources of funds and other details.\n\nCandid does not plan to finalize the data for 2022 or 2023 because it plans to sunset its site on giving to racial equity on May 30.\n\n\"We are incredibly proud of the work we did to build out this special issue site in 2020 to track funding to support racial equity following the murder of George Floyd,\" says Aleda Gagarin, Candid's vice president of influence.\n\n\"The site was meant to capture the response during that specific moment in time, similar to other rapid response sites Candid has offered like Philanthropic response to coronavirus (COVID-19) ,\" Gagarin adds. \"These kinds of sites are meant to be time-specific and in response to public interest, but such data is also available in our Foundation Maps and Foundation Directory tools.\"\n\nIn the meantime, other efforts are underway to try to understand funders' mindsets and the quantity of their racial equity giving.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision last year, for instance, the Center for Effective Philanthropy surveyed foundation leaders and found that few planned to make changes to their grantmaking and some were leaning into racial equity more deeply. CEP is releasing new data soon from nonprofits which examines whether these commitments from funders still remain.\n\nBut Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at CEP, cautioned that surveys are not substitutes for hard numbers.\n\n\"Intent to give and actual giving are not the same thing,\" Arrillaga said. \"It's important to truly understand how changes in actual grant dollars to nonprofits doing work in this area are shifting.\"\n\nMaulbeck and his colleagues at the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity conducted their own informal research through workshops and conversations with more than 100 organizers and foundation staff in late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nIn a February op-ed in the Chronicle of Philanthropy , they concluded that there had been \"a regression in recent months from core racial-justice values at the very moment deeper investments are needed.\"\n\nMaulbeck said there is usually a two-year lag in official reporting from the federal 990 tax filings, so in the absence of the data that Candid had been regularly updating, it could be a while before the sector knows exactly how funding for racial equity has evolved in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\"In the past four years and even before that, some funders have looked seriously at how to address structural racism both in their grantmaking and in internal practice. Others are currently retreating from equity and justice language for fear of hypothetical future threats,\" said Maulbeck. \"We need more funders to do the thoughtful, bold work of making equity and justice core values in their institutions and their grantmaking, regardless of the latest headlines.\"\n\nIn the meantime, nonprofits working to address the racism and systemic inequities that came into focus following the death of George Floyd may continue to struggle to direct funders' resources where they are needed most.\n\n\"If we don't understand or measure how much funding is going to racial equity,\" said CEP's Arrillaga, \"it is truly difficult to understand if we are allocating the resources necessary to make real and sustained change.\""

There was also a pretty consequential event on November 3: Amid record turnout, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the presidential election, and voters sent dozens of new faces to Washington.\n\nHere are our selections for 2020's most intriguing people, companies and trends from the realm of public policy.\n\nThis is a no-brainer. Prior to 2020, the world speed record for developing a vaccine for a novel virus was five years, for Ebola . In 2020, several companies shattered that record, some using a new mRNA-based technology that will also help us pre-emptively fight future pandemics.\n\nVoters elected 27 new women to the House of Representatives , including 20 Republicans. Some interesting new names to follow: Victoria Spartz of Indiana; Nikema Williams of Georgia; Maria Elvira Salazar of Miami; Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico; Nicole Malliotakis of Staten Island, New York; and Young Kim of Orange County, California. The Senate will welcome one female newcomer in 2021: Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, who is emerging as an opponent of Trump proposals to restrict the utility of digital assets like bitcoin.\n\nIncoming GOP congresswomen\n\nThe email newsletter service welcomed several nonconformist policy journalists in 2020, including Matt Yglesias, Jonah Goldberg, Andrew Sullivan, David French and Glenn Greenwald. As the platform grows, can it preserve its brand as a place where creative ideas can flourish?\n\nModerna and BioNTech, two young biotech companies, supplied the novel messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that has proved vital in rapidly developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. Palantir's data aggregation technology proved essential in helping governments around the world, including the U.S., monitor Covid-19 hotspots in order to direct treatments and supplies to those who most needed them.\n\nThe WHO exists to help the world fight pandemics and other global public health crises. But when it came to Covid-19, the WHO made critical blunders when it mattered. On January 14, after a WHO delegation visited China, the organization asserted that there was \" no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission \" of Covid-19-a claim that delayed international mobilization against the virus. For months, the WHO opposed the widespread wearing of masks, waiting until June to change its position .\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Republicans in the Senate will prevent President-elect Joe Biden from getting much done in Washington. But Biden and Mitch McConnell have a long working relationship, and both sides have reasons to want to work together.\n\nThe video footage of Floyd's murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer shocked the nation and moved public opinion on the importance of policing and criminal justice reform.\n\nWe selected our inaugural Forbes Policy Awards in consultation with Lanhee Chen , the David and Diane Steffy fellow in American public policy studies at the Hoover Institution and the director of domestic policy studies and a lecturer in the public policy program at Stanford University."

More International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle.  This was part of the Warriors of the Garden Peaceful Protest Against President Donald Trump's 74th Birthday that started at Trump International Tower and drew large crowds. Protesters continue taking to the streets across America and around the world after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer Derek Chauvin that was kneeling on his neck during for eight minutes, was caught on video and went viral.  During his arrest as Floyd pleaded, \"I Can't Breathe\". The protest are attempting to give a voice to the need for human rights for African American's and to stop police brutality against people of color.  They are also protesting deep-seated racism in America.   Many people were wearing masks and observing social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Photographed in the Manhattan Borough of New York on June 14, 2020, USA.  (Photo by Ira L. Black/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nWhere has the 'George Floyd racial justice money' gone? Most companies that made splashy announcements in June 2020 pledged to invest and distribute those funds over 3-5 years. It's now 27 months later. What are their plans for the billions that remain unspent and uncommitted?\n\nMinneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, on May 25, 2020. Millions of people around the world saw it on a viral video that teenager Darnella Frazier recorded . In response, an unprecedented number of companies made headline-grabbing announcements about their financial pledges to Black Lives Matter, Black community organizations, Black-owned businesses, criminal justice reform, and anti-racism efforts across the United States.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey report released in December 2020 (and updated on the one-year anniversary of Floyd's murder), more than 1,100 organizations committed a total of $200 billion to racial justice initiatives between June 2020 and May 2021. McKinsey's analyses showed that nearly 90% of those pledges came from financial institutions.\n\nTech companies also made grand announcements. For instance, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged $10 million to \"groups working on racial justice,\" which at the time was the company's single-largest donation. Intel committed $7.6 million, Apple gave $100 million, and Google put up $370 million, to name a few.\n\nA team of Washington Post journalists published data on racial justice-focused financial commitments that 44 of America's 50 biggest public companies made following Floyd's murder. Accordingly, those businesses collectively pledged nearly $50 billion. \"Looking deeper, more than 90 percent of that amount - $45.2 billion - is allocated as loans or investments they could stand to profit from, more than half in the form of mortgages.\"\n\nThere's a real chance that few people are aware that Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and other financial institutions were primarily planning to fulfill their commitments via loans. All they know is that big banks said in June 2020 that they were going to invest enormous sums of money into Black communities and racial justice efforts. Helping eliminate racial inequities in home ownership is irrefutably important and praiseworthy. But affordable home ownership mortgage programs like the raceless, potentially gentrifying one that Bank of America recently announced and will ultimately profit from isn't the same as giving no-strings-attached corporate reparations to Black Americans in the name of racial justice.\n\nLoans being disguised as investments is just one problem. A bigger, more urgent challenge is that most companies aren't effectively communicating what they're doing with the money promised 27 months ago. In many places, even their own employees don't know what's happening. Black people within and outside of those companies are growing increasingly frustrated by this. The absence of accountability and transparency invites skepticism, critique, and doubt.\n\nThe Washington Post analysis was published 14 months after Floyd's murder. At that time, 37 of the 50 largest companies had disbursed only $1.7 billion of the nearly $50 billion pledged. How much more have those and the 1,050+ other businesses captured in McKinsey's analysis paid since that time?\n\nFive noteworthy possibilities are worth acknowledgment:\n\nCompanies profited (at very least reputationally, in some instances financially) from saying they were going to do something to help fix the larger structural and systemic forces that led to the murders of Floyd and too many other Black Americans. Those businesses therefore owe it to the Floyd family, as well as to their Black employees, customers, and constituents to make transparent what they've done with the money. For those that haven't done much or anything at all, it's time to pay up.\n\nSome leaders say they're having a hard time figuring out where to invest their racial justice funds. Experts in university-based racial equity research centers could offer evidence-based guidance on where the greatest needs and highest-impact investment opportunities are.\n\nAn advisory council comprised of leaders of trustworthy racial equity organizations could advise companies on where to make their investments. The council could also help communicate what the business is doing; solicit feedback from Black communities; and help hold corporate leaders accountable for delivering on financial promises they've made in the name of racial justice. It would mean a lot to Black employees across all levels (not just those who serve in leadership roles) if they were invited to offer some input on their companies' racial justice investment strategies moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, focus group interviews and surveys could afford people of color within the local communities in which businesses are located opportunities to specify which corporate actions would make meaningful differences in their lives and circumstances.\n\nAdopting a set of under-resourced public schools in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods is one way to invest. Given that they've been chronically-underfunded for the entirety of their existence, Historically Black Colleges and Universities would also benefit tremendously from significant corporate investments. Spelman, Morehouse, Howard, and Hampton aren't the only four HBCUs; there are 97 others that also create college opportunities for Black students, many of whom come from low-income families. Hence, companies should also give their racial justice money to some of the less-recognizable HBCUs. According to this Forbes analysis , the 18 public land-grant HBCUs founded in the late 1800s have been cheated nearly $13 billion in state investments over the past three decades.\n\nBlack-owned banks and other businesses saw a boost in monetary support in 2020 . That support has since cooled. Pervasive entrepreneurial inequities continually persist. This is another area of investment opportunity. Give some of what remains of the $200 billion to Black business owners and those with financially promising ideas for startups. And give some of it to Black farmers, a group the U.S. Department of Agriculture routinely disadvantages .\n\nJackson, Mississippi, a city that is 82.5% Black, needs money right now for clean water . That would surely qualify as a racial justice investment.\n\nLet's not forget about criminal justice reform and accountability in policing. That's the racial injustice issue that millions of protestors were calling for following Floyd's murder. Businesses ought not wait until the next police killing of another unarmed Black person to do something about this problem. Hundreds of organizations across the U.S. are working on this without adequate levels of financial support.\n\nIf it's racial justice that companies are truly after, then unfortunately, there's an endless list of investment opportunities because there are racial inequities everywhere - in our education and criminal justice systems, healthcare industry, housing markets, economy, and so on. Lots of statistics from credible researchers confirm this. Therefore, the \"we don't know where to invest\" excuse is unacceptable. It feels like a stall tactic.\n\nRegardless of where companies ultimately decide to invest their remaining racial justice funds, they must do so with the highest levels of transparency and collaboration with people of color. Poor communication and white determination of what's best for Black communities aren't going to satisfy the expectations that companies manufactured when they made those splashy announcements 27 months ago."

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has shared his thoughts on a growing campaign urging President Donald Trump to pardon Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer convicted in the 2020 murder of George Floyd .\n\nMusk responded to a post from Ben Shapiro, the conservative commentator, about the initiative with a simple remark: \"Something to think about.\"\n\nShapiro, founder of the right-leaning outlet The Daily Wire, has launched a petition urging Trump to grant a presidential pardon to Chauvin, saying the former officer was \"unjustly convicted.\"\n\nChauvin is currently serving a 22-and-a-half-year state sentence for second-degree unintentional murder, as well as a concurrent 21-year federal sentence for violating George Floyd's civil rights.\n\nIn January, President Trump pardoned two Washington, D.C. police officers convicted in the 2020 killing of Karon Hylton-Brown , a 20-year-old Black man. The act of clemency raised questions about whether Trump would extend pardons to other officials involved in high-profile cases of violence against Black Americans.\n\nIn an open letter to Trump, Shapiro said that Chauvin's conviction was the result of an unfair trial environment shaped by external pressures. He stated that there was \"massive overt pressure\" on the Minnesota jury to deliver a guilty verdict, regardless of the evidence or impartial deliberation. Shapiro shared this view in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter ).\n\nMusk's response to Shapiro's post was not long but carried significant weight. As he often does to amplify his views, Musk elevated Shapiro's message with his own terse comment, ensuring the petition reached his 219 million followers on X.\n\nShapiro also reiterated the argument that Floyd's death was not caused by Chauvin's actions but rather by underlying health conditions and drug use, a defense claim that has since gained traction in conservative circles.\n\n\"George Floyd was high on fentanyl; he had a significant pre-existing heart condition,\" Shapiro said. He also referenced the official autopsy, which he argued did not show damage to Floyd's trachea.\n\nShapiro concluded by calling Chauvin's conviction \"the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics\" and said that the country \"cannot turn the page\" on what he believes to be a politically motivated conviction without overturning it.\n\nA presidential pardon from Trump would only apply to Chauvin's federal conviction . His state conviction for second-degree murder would still stand, as presidential clemency does not extend to state-level crimes. Minnesota law does allow for early release in some cases, meaning Chauvin could serve about 15 years of his state sentence before becoming eligible for parole.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said that Chauvin's actions directly caused Floyd's death. During the trial, Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker testified that Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" due to \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" While the medical report noted that Floyd had fentanyl in his system, prosecutors successfully argued that Chauvin's use of force was the primary cause of death.\n\nBen Shapiro in an open letter to President Trump: \"Make no mistake-the Derek Chauvin conviction represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive, and racist era without righting this terrible wrong\".\n\nRichard Painter, a law professor and former chief White House ethics lawyer, wrote on X: \"Derek Chauvin's Minnesota conviction cannot be pardoned by the president-only the federal conviction can be. Although not a factor in his conviction, Chauvin's crime clearly involved racism. A pardon will rightly be seen as racially motivated.\"\n\nTrump has not commented on the petition or Chauvin's case more broadly, but he has previously issued controversial pardons, including to political allies and individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJesus is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

      "text": "I Gave George Floyd First Aid. Police Have Learned Nothing\n\nJeremy Norton is a fire captain for the Minneapolis Fire Department and the author of Trauma Sponges: Dispatches from the Scarred Heart of Emergency Response.\n\nUser-generated content. Lightly edited.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nI was sitting in my fire station in South Minneapolis one morning this January when I learned of the death of Keenan Anderson after an encounter with the LAPD. My head, my heart, my gut all spasmed with anguish and frustration. This, again ?\n\nI was at my desk in March when I learned of the death in custody of Irvo Otieno, in Virginia. Again? Still?\n\nI was sitting in the same chair the night of May 25, 2020, when the Minneapolis Police used overwhelming physical force on a man who stated from the beginning of their interaction that he was anxious, claustrophobic, and hyperventilating.\n\nHe was not fighting the police; he was fighting to breathe. That man, George Floyd , died on the street six blocks from my station. My crew and I responded and assisted paramedics in the futile attempt to restore his life. We worked through the subsequent upheaval, the riots, and the tense after-times. We work there still.\n\nI watched my city burn. Saw the anguish caused, and suffered. Saw fractures and fissures in public fabric-good cops castigated and lumped with the bad. Unfair, certainly, but so many citizens have suffered blanket judgments without redress.\n\nThe city leaders made promises-most of which have remained abstract, or abandoned. Floyd, his name, and image took on a life after his death, tragically. But: I stress, we still are missing the point.\n\nI testified in the State and Federal trials of the officers involved in killing Floyd. I have seen convictions, payouts, and reams of social media postings and think pieces, and declarations from civil leaders.\n\nAnd yet, I must ask, structurally, systemically, and institutionally: What changes have been made to prevent more avoidable deaths?\n\nI argue we have yet to recognize or understand the fatal dynamics that caused the deaths of George Floyd, Keenan Anderson, Ivo Otieno, Elijah McLean, Yia Xiong, Travis Jordan, and David Smith.\n\nThe names spill off my page: I cannot tabulate the dead in the space allotted here.\n\nWe must distinguish between the truly rare aggressive and hostile person and the too-common civilian experiencing some form of altered mentation. Someone who is incoherent, who is experiencing emotional or mental distress for any reason, this person's behaviors must be recognized and treated as something other than \"resisting\" and \"refusing to comply.\"\n\nSomeone in crisis and someone aggressively hostile are not the same. It is that simple.\n\nAnderson had caused a minor traffic accident and appeared incoherent and agitated when the police officer engaged him. The officer escalated from speaking to shouting to physical restraint to fighting against a man who was clearly in distress.\n\nMore officers joined the fray. They shouted multiple commands, some contradictory; they piled on him on the ground, then deployed their Tasers-multiple times. The young man was not resisting or fighting them; he was having a crisis. His death was unnecessary and avoidable.\n\nOtieno was experiencing a mental health crisis. His family called 911 for help. The responding officers escalated a physical struggle with the agitated, panicked young man. This began a multiple-hour process of prone restraint, physical abuse, positional asphyxia, and medical neglect. His death was unnecessary and avoidable.\n\nIn my 23 years as a Minneapolis firefighter and EMT, I have been on multiple scenes with agitated civilians experiencing altered mental conditions, many people incoherent and unreachable through words and force.\n\nGeorge Floyd was not my first fatal call. We worked hard yet in futility to revive someone killed by overly aggressive officers. Every one of us at the scene carries the tragic horror with us.\n\nI have seen far too many interactions go south explicitly due to the responders' blind demand for immediate submission and acquiescence-generally the police, but at times EMS, too.\n\nHere's the crucial point, what should be at the forefront of police and EMS training as well as state and city legal discussions: The majority of these calls go badly because emergency responders are not trained, equipped, or disposed to understand what they are actually encountering.\n\nPolice, Fire, and paramedics must recognize that a person experiencing altered mentation is not the same as a person refusing to follow orders . Treating emotional and behavioral crises as deliberate aggression fails the public and the fundamental concept of emergency response.\n\nHow many civilians experiencing a mental health crisis-overwhelmingly men of color-must die at the hands, knees, and weapons of peace officers?\n\nAn investigation-of a minor vehicle collision, a bogus twenty-dollar bill, a man walking down the street-spirals out of control. Not because the subject means to harm the police officer, but because the police officer demands compliance, and if the person does not, or cannot, immediately comply, that is seen as a challenge and a threat.\n\nIf we do not change our tactical approach when encountering someone not in their right mind, we will continue to kill innocent people.\n\nThe job can be dangerous: You never know what you will encounter . But that is the essence of emergency response. It is unpredictable and often chaotic.\n\nResponders are given scant information via dispatch; we must make swift inferences immediately upon arrival. Daily, the police, paramedics, and firefighters encounter civilians in conditions or crises of altered mentation. We should expect these folks. We must be prepared for a range of people who are not going to respond coherently.\n\nWhat if the person does not speak English? Has a brain injury? Is hypoxic or hypoglycemic? In shock? Is under the influence of narcotics? What if it's my father with Alzheimer's? What if it's someone having a mental health emergency, a psychotic break?\n\nI have responded to people with each of these conditions and none of them were lucid or immediately compliant. None of them were deliberately a threat, either.\n\nThere are numerous videos of police encountering civilians in emotional distress, mental crisis, and incoherence, with the officers escalating a physical battle. Yelling orders at someone who is incoherent is a flawed, futile approach. Using joint locks, pressure point attacks, chokeholds, and bodyweight-all the forms of overwhelming physical engagement-do not calm or control a person in crisis or altered mentation. The pain inflicted by the officers will not 'bring them to their senses' but will provoke panic and a fight-or-flight response.\n\nWhen someone is pinned on the ground by several people, there can be panicked agitation, hyperventilation, and positional asphyxia.\n\nWe are directly causing a growing cardiac and respiratory crisis, one that would not be occurring had we not physically restrained the person.\n\nFor years, the city leadership repeated the police narrative: The man refused to comply. Officers attempted to subdue him. He resisted. He suffered a medical event. There was nothing else we could have done .\n\nWhat strikes me is that so many killings have occurred without any significant accountability, no rules or laws changed, no legal interventions, no oversight of department policies or training.\n\nAllowing the behaviors to persist, despite the number of dead and the settlements after the fact, is a moral failure by local, state, and national leaders.\n\nThese deaths have been accepted as the cost of policing. With increased public pressure, and abundant video evidence, more cities are prosecuting the officers involved.\n\nThis might be a step toward justice for the families of the dead, but it avoids addressing what is at the root: Poor understanding, poor training, poor guidelines, and a healthcare crisis that leaves so many people struggling with mental health, substance abuse, medication shortages.\n\nWe, the emergency responders, are the ones who engage those in crises. The cities won't do what is necessary to equip their responders with the real tools to better recognize, assess, and engage the vast range of civilians.\n\nI am not naïve. I have been on tumultuous, violent calls. I have seen aggressive, agitated, and unstable people. There was no calming or cajoling them. The longer it took us to recognize the person was beyond reaching, the more the scene deteriorated. These are scary situations. On the streets, away from the emergency departments, we need a means to safely subdue a person in crisis.\n\nSedation works. But sedation should not be dispensed wantonly. We must recognize that if we sedate someone after several minutes of agitated struggle and physical engagement, they might already be heading into respiratory or cardiac collapse.\n\nIf emergency responders cannot distinguish between someone who is a deliberate threat versus someone who is in crisis, and if we act as if there is only the former-we will continue to murder innocent people.\n\nIf city governments can only exonerate their officers, no matter their misdeeds, or else vilify the individual officers as rogues and lone wolves-avoiding the crucial roles that systemic and cultural behaviors play-they will continue to fail their citizens and their employees.\n\nThe final line of Langston Hughes' powerful poem \"Harlem\" (commonly referred to as \"A Dream Deferred\") is: \" Or does it explode? \"\n\nWhy must it take a riot to get our attention? What will it take to make actual changes?\n\nJeremy Norton is a fire captain for the Minneapolis Fire Department and the author of Trauma Sponges: Dispatches from the Scarred Heart of Emergency Response.\n\nAll views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nDo you have a unique experience or personal story to share?

The act of clemency raised questions about whether Trump would extend pardons to other officials involved in high-profile cases of violence against Black Americans.\n\nAsked by CNN's Sara Sidner what he would say to Shapiro, Floyd was blunt.\n\n\"Stay in your lane. You know, your opinion is your opinion, but facts is facts,\" Floyd said. \"And the fact is, Chauvin's knee was on my brother's neck. The fact is, he held him down there to his last breath when he shouldn't have.\"\n\nHe added, \"Once he seen that my brother was not responding, or not even moving, complying, he should have just did what normal police officers do-restrain him, cuff him, put him in the back and just do what he have to do. All of that, all of the knee on the neck-complete murder was not called for.\"\n\nEllison, who led the prosecution against Chauvin, weighed in and warned that a pardon would undermine trust in police reform efforts and the broader justice system.\n\n\"I do agree it would set us back as a society. We took great steps forward,\" Ellison said. \"There's 18,000 police departments across the United States. After the murder of George Floyd, many of them had a reflective moment and did a lot of things to try to improve police/community relationships.\"\n\nHe added that law enforcement agencies rely on public trust, which Chauvin's actions damaged.\n\n\"Derek Chauvin destroyed that trust. And they've been trying to rebuild it. So, it's actually really hurting law enforcement, because what you're saying is, good conduct, bad conduct, it doesn't matter, you get to murder people if you want to,\" Ellison said. \"And so, for every chief and every police officer out there striving to make a better department with a better relationship with their community, it is a spit in the face to them.\"\n\nChauvin was convicted in April 2021 of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, receiving a 22.5-year sentence. He later pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations, earning an additional 21-year sentence to be served concurrently.\n\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case. Chauvin is currently serving his sentence at a federal prison in Texas after being stabbed 22 times by a fellow inmate in Arizona.\n\nA presidential pardon from Trump would only apply to Chauvin's federal conviction .

The killing, which was captured on video by a bystander, ignited global protests against racial injustice, police brutality and saw a reemergence of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nChauvin had previously been incarcerated at FCI Tucson in Arizona, where he was serving a concurrent 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights and a state sentence of 22 and 1/2 years for second-degree murder.\n\nThe transfer also comes almost nine months after Chauvin survived a stabbing attack at FCI Tucson, a medium-security prison, in November 2023. He was stabbed 22 times in prison by a former gang leader and one-time FBI informant, John Turscak.\n\nTurscak, who is serving a 30-year sentence for his involvement with the Mexican Mafia prison gang, told investigators that he targeted Chauvin due to his notoriety for the killing of Floyd. Turscak has since been charged with attempted murder, and he reportedly expressed that he would have killed Chauvin if the correctional officers did not respond so quickly.\n\nAccording to the AP, Chauvin's lawyer at the time, Eric Nelson, had previously advocated for keeping him out of the general population and away from other inmates, anticipating he would be a target.\n\nMeanwhile, another former Minneapolis officer involved in Floyd's death, Thomas Lane, was released from a federal prison in Colorado on Tuesday after serving a three-year sentence for aiding and abetting manslaughter, the AP reported.\n\nLane, 41, had admitted to restraining Floyd in a way that he knew posed an unreasonable risk and contributed to Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin and Lane were two of the four officers convicted in connection to Floyd's death. The other officers, J. Alexander Kueng, who is Black and knelt on Floyd's back, and Tou Thao, who is Hmong American and kept bystanders from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint, are set to be released in 2025.\n\nChauvin, currently making a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea claiming that new evidence shows he didn't cause Floyd's death, could remain in prison until 2038 if his appeal is unsuccessful.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNatalie Venegas is a Weekend Reporter at Newsweek based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe year 2020 will be a memorable one for numerous reasons-among them the national reckoning on race triggered by the death of George Floyd .\n\nVideo footage of Floyd's death on Memorial Day after being pinned with a knee to the neck by a white Minneapolis officer shocked the nation, galvanizing Black Lives Matter protests in places across the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThey served as a wake-up call for many about the reality of police brutality and racial injustice in America, prompting the shifting of funds from police departments in some cities to social services programs. Yet the demonstrations did little to stop Black people disproportionately dying at the hands of police officers.\n\nAccording to Mapping Police Violence , officers have killed 1,066 people in 2020-more than 28 percent of them Black, despite Black people making up only 12 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nHere, Newsweek looks back at some of the Black people whose names became rallying cries for protesters demanding justice for police killings:\n\nTaylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was fatally shot when Louisville police executed a no-knock warrant at her apartment in March. Police said they did knock and announced themselves before knocking down the door with a battering ram.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, believing intruders were breaking in, fired his gun once, striking an officer in the leg. Officers returned fire, killing Taylor.\n\nA grand jury later decided not to charge any of the officers involved in the raid for Taylor's killing. Instead, one officer was charged for shooting into a neighboring home.\n\nDaniel Prude died in March, days after police officers in Rochester, New York placed a hood over his head and pressed his face into the ground for two minutes.\n\nBut the details of Prude's encounter were not known until police body camera footage was released almost six months later, triggering protests and calls for police reform.\n\nPrude's family has filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Rochester and members of the police department involved with Prude's death, alleging a cover-up by city officials and members of the police force.\n\nFloyd died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes while he gasped for air.\n\nThe officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder and manslaughter and also faces a lawsuit from Floyd's family. Three other officers involved in Floyd's killing have also been charged.\n\nHis death set off nationwide protests and discussions about policing in the U.S.\n\nBrooks, 27, was fatally shot by a police officer in the parking lot of a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia as the nation was still reeling from the unrest triggered by Floyd's killing.\n\nBody camera footage showed Brooks and officers having a calm conversation for more than 40 minutes in the early hours of June 12, but the situation turned violent when officers tried to handcuff Brooks and he resisted.\n\nAfter a struggle, Brooks grabbed one of their stun guns and fired it in their direction as he ran through the parking lot. An autopsy revealed he had been shot twice in the back.\n\nGarrett Rolfe was charged with felony murder and other offenses, while the other officer, Devin Brosnan, was charged with aggravated assault and violation of his oath.\n\nKizzee was killed August 31 in Los Angeles after sheriff's deputies tried to stop him for riding a bicycle in the wrong direction.\n\nTwo deputies told investigators they fatally shot Kizzee after he picked up a handgun he'd dropped during a struggle with one of them.\n\nAt a news conference, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said Kizzee wasn't holding a gun and didn't pose a threat when the deputies opened fire.\n\nWallace Jr., a 27-year-old, was fatally shot by two Philadelphia police officers on the afternoon of October 26.\n\nThe shooting took place after two officers responded to a residence to reports of a man with a knife. A spokesman for the Philadelphia Police Department said officers opened fire after ordering Wallace to drop the knife and that he had \"advanced toward the officers.\"\n\nThe fatal shooting sparked protests and looting in the city days before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nPrice was fatally shot by a police officer after trying to break up a fight at a gas station in Wolfe City, Texas, on October 3, according to his family and friends.\n\nShaun Lucas, the white officer who shot 31-year-old Price, has been charged with murder after investigators determined his actions that night were not \"objectionably reasonable.\"\n\nGoodson was shot and killed by an Ohio sheriff's deputy on December 4.\n\nAuthorities claimed he was waving a gun from his car in Northeast Columbus, but his family has insisted he was shot while returning home from a dentist appointment carrying a sandwich.\n\nHill, an unarmed Black man, was shot dead by a police officer in Columbus, Ohio , on December 22. The officer, Adam Coy, was fired on Monday and remains under investigation.\n\nBody camera footage showed Coy fatally shooting 47-year-old Hill and failing to administer first aid for several minutes.\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther condemned both killings on Twitter , writing on December 22: \"This morning we learned of the killing of another Black man at the hands of law enforcement. Our community is still raw and exhausted from the killings of George Floyd, f and, most recently, Casey Goodson, Jr., right here in Columbus.\"\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGeorge Floyd and Derek Chauvin reportedly worked together at a venue in Minneapolis last year, according to a former nightclub owner.\n\nFloyd died while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on May 25 last year after being apprehended on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nHis arrest was caught on camera by a bystander, whose video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, while the other two officers pinned him down.\n\nIn the footage, which went viral and sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality, Floyd can be heard pleading with officers saying \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nIt has now emerged Floyd and Chauvin were colleagues at one stage, with the former working as a bouncer and the latter working as off-duty security guard outside the venue.\n\n\"Chauvin was our off-duty police for almost the entirety of the 17 years that we were open,\" Maya Santamaria, former owner of El Nuevo Rodeo in south Minneapolis told Minneapolis and St. Paul's ABC-affiliate KSTP.\n\nWhile Floyd and Chauvin may have worked together, Santamaria admitted she could not say for certain if the two knew each other as several off-duty officers served as security guards.\n\n\"They were working together at the same time, it's just that Chauvin worked outside and the security guards were inside.\"\n\nSantamaria, who sold the venue only months ago, added that when she first saw the video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd she initially failed to recognize either of her employees.\n\n\"I didn't recognize George as one of our security guys because he looked really different lying there like that.\"\n\nChauvin has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder and is one of four officers who will stand trial in Minneapolis from Monday.\n\nThe 45-year-old was fired from the MPD and could face up to 40 years in prison if found guilty of second-degree murder. Eric Nelson, his defense attorney, has not confirmed whether his client will testify.\n\nAn autopsy carried out by Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, in June last year concluded Floyd's death was a homicide .\n\nAccording to the report, Floyd died of \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"\n\nThe findings were markedly different from the initial report, which had found \"no physical findings\" to \"support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\". The preliminary report also indicated Floyd had used drugs before his arrest and had underlying conditions which contributed to his death.\n\nEarlier this month, the city of Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle a civil lawsuit.\n\n\"I hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,\" the city's council president, Lisa Bender, said in a statement.\n\n\"But I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.\"\n\nBen Crump, the Floyd's family attorney, said the sum was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit.\n\n\"While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all,\" Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd, said.\n\nDan Cancian is currently a reporter for Newsweek based in London, England.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservative pundit Tucker Carlson has claimed this week that new court papers show George Floyd was not murdered in May 2020 by then police officer Derek Chauvin .\n\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Chauvin, who is white, was found guilty in April 2021 of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd , who was Black.\n\nIn a new clip on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday, Carlson alleged a recent court deposition, had proven Chauvin had not murdered Floyd.\n\nHowever, as Newsweek has found, Carlson's analysis bears some examination.\n\nThe Claim\n\nIn a video clip posted on X , formerly Twitter , by Tucker Carlson's account on October 20, 2023, and since viewed more than 21 million times, Carlson said that Floyd was not murdered by Chauvin.\n\nCarlson said during the clip \"...did he [Chauvin] actually murder George Floyd? And the answer is, well, no he didn't murder George Floyd.\n\n\"We're not guessing about that. We know it conclusively thanks to a new court case now underway in Hennepin County, Minnesota.\"\n\nThat refers to an ongoing lawsuit by Amy Sweasy Tamburino, a prosecutor in Hennepin County, where the Chauvin case was tried. Sweasy is suing the county over a legal settlement she reached with it in 2022. She had initially filed discrimination charges against the county.\n\nCase files include a deposition from Sweasy in which she mentioned a conversation with the county's medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, after he performed Floyd's autopsy.\n\nIn the Carlson clip, text attributed to Sweasy read: \"I called Dr. Baker early that morning to tell him about the case and to ask him if he would perform the autopsy on Mr Floyd.\n\n\"He called me later in the day on that Tuesday and he told me that there were no medical findings that showed any injury to the vital structures of Mr. Floyd's neck.\n\n\"There were no medical indications of asphyxia or strangulation.\"\n\nCarlson then said: \"In other words, George Floyd, according to the official autopsy was not murdered.\" He added that Floyd died of \"natural causes, which in his case would include decades of drug use, as well as the fatal concentration of fentanyl that was in his system on his final day.\"\n\n\"So this was not a killing. It was yet another narcotics OD [overdose].\"\n\nCarlson then went on to say that Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Baker \"clearly understood that and in fact articulated it.\"\n\nFurther text appeared on screen, again quoting Sweasy, stating that Dr. Baker told her \"He said to me, 'Amy, what happens when the actual evidence doesn't match up with the public narrative that everyone's already decided on?...And then he said, ' This is the kind of case that ends careers.'\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nCarlson's claim contradicts the findings of the autopsy report, while the deposition adds no substantive support to the former Fox News host's argument.\n\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner's (HCME) autopsy did not record neck injuries , or other \"life-threatening injuries;\" however, the report concluded Floyd died from \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"\n\nThe American Heart Association identifies cardiopulmonary arrest as the \"abrupt loss of heart function in a person.\"\n\nAt trial, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson asked HCME medical examiner Baker whether labeling the death as a homicide \"was a medical determination you made?\" Baker replied: \"Correct.\"\n\nA lack of injury does not mean there was no asphyxia either. Dr. Gregory Davis, a medical advisor for Jefferson County, Alabama, told the Associated Press in June 2020 that bruising or damage to the neck \"doesn't in any way mean that asphyxia didn't occur,\" only that there are no signs of it on the body.\n\nThe deposition that Carlson quotes does not advance the claim that Floyd was not murdered. Sweasy spoke to counsel for the defendants, as part of her lawsuit against the county , on August 21, 2023, available via Minnesota Court Records Online.\n\nIn her deposition, Sweasy recalled a conversation with Baker in June 2020, during which he allegedly said there were \"no medical findings that showed any injury to the vital structures of Mr Floyd's Neck.\" Sweasy added that Baker said \"'This is the kind of case that ends careers.'\"\n\nThere is no other information about the context or detail of the conversation between Sweasy and Baker.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Sweasy's attorneys via email for comment.\n\nA representative for Hennepin County told Newsweek that \"Dr. Baker cannot comment on statements made by other people in their depositions.\n\n\"He stands by the autopsy report and his televised testimony, both of which are publicly available.\" You can access that autopsy report here .\n\nAs stated, Baker concluded in Floyd's autopsy that he died from \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,\" labeling his death a homicide.\n\nCarlson's claim that Baker \"understood\" Floyd died of \"natural causes\" related to drug use, therefore, is wrong.\n\nDuring Chauvin's trial, Baker told Chauvin's attorney that if Floyd had been found at home in his locked residence with no evidence of trauma, and the only autopsy finding was his fentanyl level \"then yes I would certify his death is due to fentanyl toxicity,\" adding, \"the interpretation of drug concentrations is very context-dependent.\"\n\nHowever, just as the autopsy stated, Baker said it was his opinion that Floyd \"experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest in the context of the law enforcement's subdual, restraint and neck compression.\"\n\n\"It was the stress of that interaction that tipped him over the edge given his underlying heart disease and his toxicological status.\"\n\nCarlson was approached for comment via his X account on the morning of October 24. He has yet to respond to the points raised above.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nTucker Carlson has not provided evidence showing George Floyd was not murdered by Chauvin.\n\nA recently published deposition Carlson quotes, which mentioned an alleged conversation with a medical examiner who conducted Floyd's autopsy, provides no new information about Floyd's death.\n\nThe examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, said in court that his death was labeled homicide caused by \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"\n\nA claim Carlson makes that Baker \"understood\" Floyd died of \"natural causes\" is false, as is Carlson's claim that Floyd's autopsy shows he was not killed by Chauvin.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team\n\nTom Norton is Newsweek's Fact Check reporter, based in London.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGeorge Floyd 's uncle spoke out about policing issues in Phoenix , Arizona, saying he thinks the topic is not getting the attention it should.\n\nIn a statement broadcast by KNXV-TV , a local ABC affiliate, Roger Floyd, whose nephew would have turned 51 on Monday, discussed the case of Tyron McAlpin.\n\nMcAlpin, a deaf Black man with cerebral palsy, was arrested on August 19 by Phoenix police. Recently released bodycam footage showed him being punched and tased by officers while lying face-down on the ground, CNN reported.\n\nFloyd said , \"Just like in the case of my nephew George, if you will, the world saw what happened to him. That reminded me of his situation when that deaf gentleman was attacked by the police officers. I mean, there was absolutely no means of de-escalation at all.\"\n\nMcAlpin, 34, has been charged with resisting arrest and two counts of aggravated assault on a police officer, CNN reports. His encounter with Arizona police has sparked widespread outrage on social media, and the incident has been under an internal investigation since August, according to NBC .\n\nIt follows the Department of Justice 's investigation into the Phoenix police department in June, which resulted in findings that the department has used excessive force, and disproportionately enforced laws against minorities and homeless people, restricting freedom of speech and expression, and violating constitutional rights.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Phoenix Police Department for comment via email outside of business hours.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department confirmed that the incident is the subject of an ongoing internal investigation and was assigned to the Professional Standards Bureau on August 30, 2024.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department also provided the following statement to Newsweek from the Interim Phoenix Police Chief, Michael G. Sullivan, \"Since I took the job as Interim Chief of the Phoenix Police Department, I have talked a lot about striving to be a self-assessing, self-correcting agency. That means taking a serious look at cases that may call into question the actions of our officers. There are many who are concerned after seeing the video of officers' interaction with a man they later learned was disabled. I recognize the video is disturbing and raises a lot of questions. I want to assure the community we will get answers to those questions.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Shortly after this incident, the Professional Standard Bureau launched an internal investigation into this incident. Their work is important to ensure all facts are known before drawing any conclusions. I ask for the public's patience during that process. Once the investigation is complete, I will personally review the findings and take appropriate action. The PSB investigation will also be reviewed by the Office of Accountability and Transparency as well as the Civilian Review Board to ensure it is thorough and complete. Accountability for our actions as a Police Department is paramount as we work every day to build and maintain the trust of the community we serve.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd , 46, a black man, was arrested and then murdered by Derek Chauvin , a white police officer, in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, and his death sparked outcry globally as people protested police brutality in the US.\n\nSpeaking about the response to his nephew's death, Floyd said , \"Initially it made a tremendous difference, especially when the trial was going on. But as time goes on, there are other distractions that come about, and they seem to go back into their old mode of operation, and that's unfortunately and we see that happen every single day.\"\n\nIn his push for social equity and police reform, Floyd also emphasized that he wants newly elected officials to bring back the conversation regarding relations between the police and the public.\n\nThe Floyd family now runs the Floyd Family Center for Social Equity , a nonprofit aimed at uplifting communities by promoting health, education, finances, scholarship, and the arts, in his memory.\n\nFloyd also said that he hoped lawmakers would re-introduce the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (2021), which focuses on law enforcement accountability and racial profiling by law enforcement officers and was passed in the House but has remained in the Senate since 2021.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe family of George Floyd , the Black man who was killed by law enforcement in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May 2020, is considering suing Kanye West after the rapper spread a conspiracy theory claiming that Floyd died by fentanyl instead of the police brutality.\n\nThe Grammy-winning hip hop star and fashion designer, now known legally as \"Ye\", made the comments about Floyd while speaking about conservative pundit Candace Owens ' documentary The Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM.\n\nOn the 'Drink Champs' podcast, Ye said: \"I watched the George Floyd documentary that Candace Owens put out.\n\n\"One of the things that his two roommates said was they want a tall guy like me, and the day that he died, he said a prayer for eight minutes.\n\n\"They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy's knee wasn't even on his neck like that.\"\n\nFentanyl is a powerful opioid used by medics to treat severe pain that is known to be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Both substances are highly addictive.\n\nAlthough medical experts said Floyd had a small amount of the drug in his bloodstream, doctors confirmed he died due to officer Derek Chauvin 's knee being on him for eight minutes, causing asphyxiation, as was widely reported at the time.\n\nChauvin was later sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for Floyd's murder.\n\nResponding to Ye's comments, Floyd's family lawyer Lee Merritt tweeted on Monday: \"While one cannot defame the dead, the family of #GeorgeFloyd is considering suit for Kanye's false statements about the manner of his death.\n\n\"Claiming Floyd died from fentanyl not the brutality established criminally and civilly undermines & diminishes the Floyd family's fight,\" the civil rights attorney added.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Floyd family through their other lawyer Ben Crump .\n\nOwens and Ye are friends, and both have been in the news for other controversy recently.\n\nYe was suspended from Twitter and by Meta , which owns Instagram and Facebook , for going on an antisemitic tirade on the social media platforms.\n\nOwens defended Ye's comments, which were condemned by Jewish groups, which claimed the rapper's comments were antisemitic.\n\nThe two were also pictured backstage during the Yeezey Season 9 show at Paris Fashion Week wearing t-shirts with the slogan \"White Lives Matter,\" emblazoned on them.\n\nThe slogan is classified by the Anti-Defamation League as a \"white supremacist phrase.\"\n\nThe phrase originated in response to the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2015, which rallied behind Floyd's family after his death, and has been used by white supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Renaissance Society.\n\nJack Dutton is a Newsweek Reporter based in Cape Town, South Africa.

Since then, the public, thanks to the reporting of mainstream journalists, has settled on a consensus about what happened to Floyd on the evening of May 25, 2020: officers were in the process of arresting Floyd for paying with counterfeit money at a convenience store when Officer Derek Chauvin, with conscious cruelty, subjected him to his \" signature move \"-a knee on the neck-cutting off his oxygen supply and murdering him.

The producer of the film, Liz Collin, was a successful reporter and anchor at WCCO, Channel 4, in Minneapolis for many years before the death of George Floyd derailed her career. The sticking point was that her husband, former lieutenant and president of Minneapolis police union Bob Kroll, defended the four officers who arrested Floyd, denounced the rioters, who had recently captured and burned down a police precinct, as a \"terrorist\" movement, and highlighted Floyd's long rap sheet in a letter to police union members.\n\nBoth Kroll and Collin received an intense cancellation-including a protest outside their home-which led WCCO to push Collin out of her anchoring job, and eventually led her to leave WCCO and join Alpha News. While there, she teamed up with the film's director, Dr. JC Chaix, a former police officer and volunteer firefighter, to make The Fall of Minneapolis .\n\nWhen people think of George Floyd, they think of a viral clip captured and uploaded by a bystander. The infamous clip appeared to show Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (later amended to 9 minutes and 29 seconds ) along with Floyd's bone-chilling screams: \"I can't breathe!\"; \"Mama!\"; \"I'm gonna die!\"\n\nLike everyone who watched this clip, I was horrified when I saw it. I could not understand why Chauvin continued to keep his knee on Floyd's neck when he clearly couldn't breathe. I couldn't even understand why they put him belly-down on the pavement in the first place-a humiliating and uncomfortable position-rather than in the back of the squad car.\n\nBut the viral clip, as so many often do, started in the middle of the story. When Judge Peter Cahill allowed full footage (with multiple angles) to become public in August 2020, it showed three things that were not obvious from the viral clip:\n\nFirst, the officers spent several minutes trying to get Floyd into the back of the squad car before agreeing, at Floyd's request, to place him on the ground instead. (Floyd had complained of claustrophobia in the back of the squad car.)\n\nSecond, Chauvin's knee was not on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. It was probably on his neck for at most 4 minutes, after which it appeared to be \"above the shoulder blades,\" as one of the prosecution's own witnesses conceded during Chauvin's criminal trial in 2021.\n\nThird, and most importantly, Floyd was saying that he couldn't breathe before he was placed on the ground, as this clip from the documentary shows below:\n\nThe court of public opinion may have made up its mind based on a single out-of-context clip. But Chauvin's trial in 2021 represented a chance to revise that consensus in light of all the evidence. In order to convict Chauvin of felony murder -which differs from more serious murder charges in that it requires neither premeditation nor intent to kill-the prosecution had to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Among other things, they had to prove that (1) Chauvin's actions constituted assault (or attempted assault), and (2) that Chauvin's actions caused the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe documentary throws both claims into doubt. What I discovered by making my own calls and confirming the documents shown in the documentary is that these key claims are not certain at all.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "The Convictions of 3 Cops Who Failed To Prevent George Floyd's Death Underline the Duty To Intervene\n\nGeorge Floyd\n\nJacob Sullum | 2.25.2022 12:10 PM\n\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were convicted in federal court yesterday of failing to intervene or render medical aid as their colleague, Derek Chauvin, killed George Floyd by pinning him face-down to the pavement for nine and a half minutes on May 25, 2020. After deliberating for about 13 hours, the jury concluded that Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao had violated 18 USC 242 by depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights under color of law. Because the jury also concluded that Floyd's prolonged prone restraint caused his death, the three defendants could face lengthy prison sentences.\n\nChauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd last April, is serving a state sentence of 22.5 years. He pleaded guilty in December to violating the same federal law under which Lane, Kueng, and Thao were charged. The focus of the case against them was not what they did that day but what they failed to do. Their convictions send a powerful message about the legal peril for police officers who ignore their duty to stop colleagues from using excessive force.\n\nThe encounter that led to Floyd's death began when Lane and Kueng, both of whom were in their first week as full-fledged police officers, arrested him for using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at Cup Foods, a restaurant and convenience store on Chicago Avenue. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran who had been Kueng's training officer, arrived as the two rookies were unsuccessfully trying to force a distraught Floyd into the back seat of their squad car.\n\nAfter Chauvin took charge, Floyd was handcuffed and forced to lie on his stomach as Chauvin knelt on his neck, Kueng applied pressure to his back, and Lane held his legs. He remained in that position until he died, after complaining, over and over again, that he could not breathe. Thao, meanwhile, was charged with keeping a group of concerned bystanders away from Floyd and the other three officers. A bystander video of the incident provoked bipartisan outrage, nationwide protests, and the four officers' dismissal.\n\nSince the charges against Lane, Kueng, and Thao alleged that they \"willfully\" deprived Floyd of his rights, one of the issues in the trial was whether they knew that Chauvin was using excessive, potentially lethal force. That should have been obvious, the prosecution argued, given Floyd's pleas for relief and the repeated warnings from witnesses who recognized that his life was in danger. By the time Floyd lost consciousness, in any event, it should have been clear that he needed medical attention and that his continued restraint was utterly gratuitous. Even after Floyd no longer had a detectable pulse, Chauvin kept his knee on his neck.\n\n\"For more than nine minutes, each of the three defendants made a conscious choice over and over again not to act,\" federal prosecutor Samantha Trepel told the jury. \"They chose not to intervene and stop Chauvin as he killed a man slowly in front of their eyes on a public street in broad daylight.\"\n\nLane clearly recognized the danger, since he repeatedly suggested that Floyd should be rolled onto his side, which was consistent with what officers are taught about the risk of \"positional asphyxia\" during prolonged prone restraints. Unlike the other two defendants, Lane was not charged with failing to stop Chauvin from using excessive force. But like them, he was charged with failing to perform CPR or move Floyd into a position in which it would have been easier to breathe.\n\nThe defendants argued that their training had been inadequate to prepare them for this situation. They also argued that they understandably deferred to Chauvin, the senior officer at the scene.\n\nThao, unlike Lane and Kueng, was not a rookie; he had been employed by the Minneapolis Police Department for about 11 years. But his lawyer argued that Thao was not close enough to clearly understand what was happening and that he was distracted by his crowd and traffic control duties.\n\nThe jury clearly did not buy that excuse. The bystanders were angry precisely because they correctly believed that Chauvin was killing Floyd, and Thao reacted to their complaints by falsely assuring them that Floyd was fine. He even seemed to make light of the situation, saying, \"This is why you don't do drugs, kids.\"\n\nInstead of dismissing the bystanders' warnings, the prosecution argued, the defendants should have recognized that the witnesses were right. \"After Mr. Floyd lost the ability to speak, the people on the sidewalk stood up for him,\" Trepel said. \"They understood just by seeing his body go limp, listening to his words and then listening to his silence that, unless somebody changed what was happening, he would die.\"\n\nLane, Kueng, and Thao still face state charges that they aided and abetted Chauvin's crimes. Their state trial, which is scheduled to begin on June 13 in Hennepin County District Court, will focus on whether they \"intentionally aided\" Chauvin in committing felony murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nAfter the state charges were filed, Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, noted that they are \"legally valid under Minnesota law\" but \"rely on some fringe doctrines of accomplice liability.\" Those doctrines, he added, \"have long been criticized by progressive reformers\" because they \"create expansive strict liability for minor participants in group crimes.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Even at His Sentencing Hearing, Derek Chauvin Did Not Manage To Express Remorse for Killing George Floyd\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nJacob Sullum | 7.8.2022 2:25 PM\n\nDerek Chauvin, who received a 21-year federal sentence yesterday for lethally violating George Floyd's constitutional rights, still seems to think he did nothing wrong by kneeling on his victim's neck until he was dead. Judging from Chauvin's conspicuous failure to express remorse prior to his sentencing, he is sticking with the story he told at his state trial last year.\n\nPrior to that trial, Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, blamed Floyd's death on an inept arrest by two rookie police officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, who were responding to a complaint that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes from a convenience store. \"If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle,\" Nelson said, \"Mr. Floyd may have survived.\" That was an audacious defense in light of Chauvin's subsequent treatment of Floyd, which was cruelly indifferent at best and hardly a model of de-escalation.\n\nDuring Chauvin's trial, which ended in guilty verdicts on all counts, Nelson argued that the ex-cop's actions were justified in the circumstances. He even presented an expert witness who preposterously maintained that the prolonged prone restraint, during which Chauvin pressed a handcuffed, terrified man to the pavement for nine and a half minutes, did not qualify as a use of force.\n\nChauvin did not speak at his state trial. But after his convictions, he offered his \"condolences to the Floyd family,\" saying \"there's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest,\" and \"I hope things will give you...some peace of mind.\" He added that he could not say more because of \"additional legal matters at hand,\" presumably referring to the federal case. Yet even after those \"legal matters\" were resolved by a plea agreement in which Chauvin admitted to using excessive force against Floyd, Chauvin offered Floyd's family nothing beyond some good wishes.\n\nThe plea agreement called for a sentence of 20 to 25 years. In arguing for the lowest possible sentence, The Washington Post notes , Nelson cited his client's \"acceptance of his wrongdoing.\" The Post reports that Nelson \"spoke of Chauvin's 'remorse for the harm that has flowed from his actions' and told the court the former officer would demonstrate that at his sentencing.\" But that did not happen.\n\n\"In a brief statement during Thursday's hearing,\" the Post says, \"Chauvin did not offer any formal apologies or remorse for his actions.\" Instead he wished Floyd's children well. \"I just want to say I wish them all the best in their life,\" Chauvin said. He added that he hoped they would have \"excellent guidance in becoming great adults.\"\n\nChauvin displayed the same condescending, unrepentant attitude toward John Pope, another victim of his brutality. As part of his agreement with the Justice Department, Chauvin pleaded guilty to using excessive force against Pope, then 14, in 2017. The encounter began with a complaint from Pope's mother, who said he had assaulted her. Although Pope \"made no aggressive moves\" against the officers who responded to that call, Chauvin admitted, he repeatedly hit Pope on the head with a flashlight and knelt on him for more than 15 minutes.\n\n\"I was treated as though I was not a human being by Derek Chauvin,\" Pope, now 19, said at the sentencing hearing. \"He made a choice and did not care for the outcome.\" Pope, who until the encounter with Chauvin was getting good grades in school and planned to attend college, said the experience had upended his life, leaving him with a feeling of powerlessness that derailed his plans.\n\nIn his statement to the court, the Post notes, Chauvin \"did not apologize to Pope but said he wished the man well.\" This is what Pope got in lieu of an apology: \"I hope you have the ability to get the best education possible to lead a very productive and rewarding life.\" Chauvin also wished him \"a good relationship with your mother.\"\n\nChauvin's lack of contrition for his crimes against Floyd and Pope is especially striking in this context, where he had already pleaded guilty and was looking for mercy from U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson. Despite the stakes, Chauvin could not bring himself even to feign regret for his actions. \"I really don't know why you did what you did,\" Magnuson said, \"but to put your knee on another person's neck until they expired is simply wrong, and for that conduct you must be substantially punished.\"\n\nChauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, did not help his case. As The New York Times notes , she thought it was important to note that Chauvin had received thousands of supportive cards, \"enough to fill a room of her house.\" Pawlenty cited her son's 20 years of service in the Minneapolis Police Department and complained that he had been abandoned by his colleagues, several of whom, including the police chief , testified against him in his state trial. In her view, they had \"failed to back their own.\" The real victim, she implied, was Chauvin, not the man whose desperate pleas for relief he ignored while blithely pinning him to the street.\n\nWhat Pawlenty perceives as a failure was actually a belated acknowledgement that the police department had for two decades continued to employ an officer who was manifestly unsuited for the job. According to the federal civil rights lawsuit that Floyd's family filed after his death, which led to a $27 million settlement with the city, Chauvin \"engaged in a reckless police chase resulting in the deaths of three individuals\" 15 years before he killed Floyd \"but was not discharged.\" Between 2006 and 2015, the lawsuit noted, \"Chauvin was the subject of 17 citizen complaints.\" Just one \"resulted in discipline, in the form of a letter of reprimand.\"\n\nWhen supervisors treat such complaints as evidence that an officer is simply doing his job rather than evidence that he has little regard for people's rights, they invite further abuses. That's the predictable result of the reflexive support that Pawlenty thinks Chauvin's colleagues should have offered after he killed Floyd. The same impulse explains the thousands of cards that Pawlenty cited as evidence of her son's good character.\n\nA habit of uncritical deference also explains the inaction of the three officers-Lane, Kueng, and Tou Thao-who failed to stop Chauvin, the senior officer at the scene, from crushing the life out of Floyd. In February, a federal jury convicted Lane, Kueng, and Thao of violating Floyd's rights by failing to intervene or render medical aid. They were also charged with state crimes. Lane, the only officer who dared to suggest that continuing to pin Floyd facedown on the pavement might be inadvisable, pleaded guilty to a state manslaughter charge in May and is scheduled to be sentenced in September. The state trial of Kueng and Thao is scheduled to begin in January.\n\nSuch serial prosecutions have been blessed by the Supreme Court, which deems them consistent with the Fifth Amendment's ban on double jeopardy even when the elements of the state and federal offenses are the same. In these cases, the elements are different, since the federal crimes hinge on a willful deprivation of rights under color of law. Still, one might reasonably ask why it is necessary or appropriate to prosecute these four officers twice for the same conduct.\n\nMark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in the Twin Cities, suggests that Chauvin's second prosecution was necessary to send a message. \"It was the federal government making a statement about this case being important nationally,\" Osler told the Times . \"And it also was a conviction on something beyond what we saw in the state. It was about the deprivation of civil rights, not just the killing of George Floyd.\"\n\nWhile Chauvin had never been prosecuted for his attack on Pope, he had already received a sentence of more than 22 years under state law for killing Floyd. But since Chauvin will be serving the two sentences concurrently, the main practical impact of the federal case will be that he serves his time in federal prison, which is preferable from his perspective because it means he is less likely to encounter people he arrested in Minneapolis. Chauvin has been in solitary confinement at a state prison in St. Paul since he was convicted in April 2021.\n\nIt seems doubtful that the federal prosecution was necessary to show that Floyd's death, which provoked bipartisan disgust, protests across the country, and police reforms in various cities and states, was \"important nationally.\" And what was the state jury that convicted Chauvin of murder doing if not vindicating Floyd's rights as an American citizen and a human being? But if nothing else, the federal case gave Chauvin another opportunity to acknowledge the grievous wrong he had done. Apparently, that was still more than he could manage.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Watch\n\nFor a few precious days after the death of George Floyd, there was at least a clear consensus across the political spectrum - there was near-unanimity that what Darnella Frazier captured on her cell phone was a crime. An outrage. A thing to be denounced.\n\nAs Floyd lay handcuffed on his stomach, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's back for nine minutes as Floyd became unresponsive, then went limp, then died. Even the most vocal police supporters condemned Chauvin's actions, though with obligatory disclaimers that Chauvin was a rogue, aberrant bad apple, and that no one should judge all law enforcement officers by his actions.\n\nThe consensus wouldn't last. As protests heated up around the country, far-right pundits began to break away. They pointed to Floyd's criminal record, the violence at some of the protests, and the allegedly radical positions of the organizers. Dennis Prager, the radio host and founder of a fake university, marveled to his audience how \"decent\" MPD officers had been to Floyd.\n\nA couple months later, Chauvin's defense team filed a motion that included some preliminary - and admittedly odd - comments that medical examiner Andrew Baker made to a prosecutor about Floyd's health and drug use. Those comments were then picked up by right-wing and law enforcement outlets, and a counter-narrative was born.\n\nBy the time of Chauvin's trial in April 2021, far-right pundits , politicians , and social media accounts with large followings were openly defending Chauvin , openly rooting for his acquittal, and openly angry when he was convicted.\n\nTucker Carlson, uninhibited by any intellectually honest grasp of U.S. history, proclaimed that Chauvin was about to be \"lynched.\"\n\nThese defenses of Chauvin continued sporadically, then got a boost in August 2022 when Liz Collin, a Minneapolis TV reporter and the wife of infamous Minneapolis police union leader Bob Kroll , self-published the book They're Lying: The Media, The Left, and The Death of George Floyd. Collin had been a longtime anchor for the CBS affiliate in Minneapolis. Both she and Kroll were targeted by activists after Floyd's death, including protests outside their home. Collin left the station in January 2022. Depending on who you believe, she was either forced out or resigned after she was removed from the anchor position. She then joined a conservative-funded outlet called Alpha News.\n\nCollin's book provided further fuel for far-right bomb throwers and conspiracy theorists, but her allegations didn't really take off until she, Alpha News, and a former police officer named J.C. Chaix made The Fall of Minneapolis, a crowd-sourced documentary based on the book.\n\nTFOM makes some nutty claims, including that the FBI ordered George Floyd's autopsy to be altered to incriminate Chauvin, an allegation that echoes the contempt southern coroners had for FBI investigators looking into lynchings and the murder of activists during the civil rights era. Collin also interviews Chauvin, Chauvin's mother, Chauvin's lawyer, and a half dozen or so current and former Minneapolis police officers who still support Chauvin\n\nBy last October, far-right white grievance mongers like Carlson had been amplifying Collin for months. Carlson dedicated portions of his show - which by then was hosted on X - to pushing the documentary and its allegations. Those episodes were then touted by Elon Musk and the tech-bro social media ecosystem until it eventually wound up on the Facebook page of every racist uncle in America.\n\nThe documentary has inspired some inflammatory rhetoric. Where there was once agreement among most conservatives that Derek Chauvin was a rogue cop whose murder of George Floyd was witnessed by a good chunk of humanity, for much of the right, Chauvin is now a political prisoner who has been framed by craven state and federal officials who caved to the social justice mobs. A poll taken after the verdict found that nearly half of Republicans thought Chauvin should have been acquitted.\n\nBy the end of last year, the documentary had been amplified by more mainstream conservatives. Former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly touted her interview with Chaix and Collins by claiming to have \"new\" body camera footage that would \"change the narrative.\" The footage had been publicly available for more than two years.\n\nThe documentary has since been promoted by the New York Post , on the podcast hosted by John McWhorter and Glenn Loury , and by \"heterodox\" voices like Brett Weinstein.\n\nThe latest outlet to run with these claims is the Free Press, founded by former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss, in a piece by Coleman Hughes .\n\nThe Free Press feels like new territory for these conspiracies. A number of people have sent me Hughes's column, including longtime readers of my own work who tell me they find it persuasive. Hughes, though a fellow at the far-right and reliably pro-police Manhattan Institute, isn't viewed as a demagogue like Carlson. He's been described as \"a thinker to be reckoned with\" and \"one of the most prolific and insightful commentators on race and class in the United States.\" The Free Press itself claims to be \"built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.\"\n\nAs far as I know, the Free Press is the first major publication that doesn't self-identify as conservative to cover the documentary reverently, and to amplify its claims - though its critics would say that despite its claim to \"fierce independence,\" the Free Press is, in fact, pretty conservative.\n\nHughes's piece, then is, a useful lens through which to analyze which TFOM allegations seem to be resonating with a broader audience, and for that reason, I think it's worth a detailed response.\n\nThe documentary makes a lot of outlandish claims, but I want to focus mostly on the two that I've seen most often. These are also the two claims that Hughes spends most of his piece promoting.\n\nThe first claim is that when Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's back and neck for nine minutes, it could not have been criminal assault because the Minneapolis Police Department has trained its officers -- including Chauvin -- to use that very technique.\n\nThe second claim is that Floyd's official autopsy found that he died of a heart attack brought on by cardiovascular disease and drug use. Therefore, Chauvin could not have been responsible for Floyd's death.\n\nBoth of these claims are false. The first claim is not only incorrect, the documentary engages in deceptive editing and convenient omissions to push it. In other words, the documentary is lying. The second claim is also incorrect, but the explanation is a bit more complicated.\n\nI'm going to address the first claim in this post. I'll look at the second claim in my next post. I'll also put up a third and final post addressing some of Hughes's other points, and what I think this massive effort to retcon Floyd's death is really all about.\n\nSo let's dig in to that first claim, which goes something like this:\n\nWhen Derek Chauvin put his knee and weight on George Floyd's back and neck for nine minutes it not only wasn't a crime, it was MPD policy, and it was a tactic that the department had taught to Chauvin and other officers for years.\n\nHere's how Hughes sets it up:\n\nIn order to convict Chauvin of felony murder . . . they had to prove that (1) Chauvinʼs actions constituted assault (or attempted assault), and (2) that Chauvinʼs actions caused the death of George Floyd. The documentary throws both claims into doubt. What I discovered by making my own calls and confirming the documents shown in the documentary is that these key claims are not certain at all . . .\n\nCentral to proving the first element-felony assault-was the question: Why did Chauvin have his knee on Floydʼs neck and shoulder blade in the first place? If it was an \"improvised position,\" as an MPD inspector testified at the trial, then it plausibly constituted felony assault. But if it was a hold that Chauvin, along with the entire MPD, was trained to do in precisely this kind of situation, then it becomes far harder to argue it was assault.\n\nAccording to the documentary and documents I have reviewed, the move was indeed a standard hold, called the Maximal Restraint Technique (MRT), which the MPD trained its officers to use \"in situations where handcuffed subjects are combative and still pose a threat to themselves, officers, or others, or could cause significant damage to property if not properly restrained,\" according to the official MPD use-of-force manual. The section that describes MRT is dated to 2002 and was updated in 2014, 2017, and 2018. (The 2023 edition bans MRT.)\n\nIt's interesting that Hughes assures us early on that he's the sort writer who \"makes his own calls,\" and only makes those calls after he \"confirms the documents.\" This is supposed to make us trust him. He doesn't take anyone's word for it. He can't be spun. He does his own research.\n\nExcept it seems pretty clear that he doesn't.\n\nSo let's start here: It is true that MRT was once a procedure taught and used by the MPD. It is not true - not by a long shot - that MRT is what Derek Chauvin used on George Floyd.\n\nI pulled up the relevant part of the MPD policy manual, the portion that was in use in 2014.\n\nHere's what it says about MRT. I have put the most relevant portions in bold.\n\nA. Maximal Restraint Technique - Use (06/13/14)\n\nThe Maximal Restraint Technique shall only be used in situations where handcuffed subjects are combative and still pose a threat to themselves, officers or others, or could cause significant damage to property if not properly restrained.\n\nUsing the hobble restraint device, the MRT is accomplished in the following manner:\n\na. One hobble restraint device is placed around the subject's waist.\n\nb. A second hobble restraint device is placed around the subject's feet.\n\nc. Connect the hobble restraint device around the feet to the hobble restraint device around the waist in front of the subject.\n\nd. Do not tie the feet of the subject directly to their hands behind their back. This is also known as a hogtie.\n\n3. A supervisor shall be called to the scene where a subject has been restrained using the MRT to evaluate the manner in which the MRT was applied and to evaluate the method of transport.\n\nB. Maximal Restraint Technique - Safety (06/13/14)\n\n1. As soon as reasonably possible, any person restrained using the MRT who is in the prone position shall be placed in the following positions based on the type of restraint used:\n\na. If the hobble restraint device is used, the person shall be placed in the side recovery position.\n\n2. When using the MRT, an EMS response should be considered.\n\n3. Under no circumstances, shall a subject restrained using the MRT be transported in the prone position.\n\n4. Officers shall monitor the restrained subject until the arrival of medical personnel, if necessary, or transfer to another agency occurs.\n\n5. In the event any suspected medical conditions arise prior to transport, officers will notify paramedics and request a medical evaluation of the subject or transport the subject immediately to a hospital.\n\n6. A prisoner under Maximal Restraint should be transported by a two-officer squad, when feasible. The restrained subject shall be seated upright, unless it is necessary to transport them on their side. The MVR should be activated during transport, when available.\n\n7. Officers shall also inform the person who takes custody of the subject that the MRT was applied.\n\nC. Maximal Restraint Technique - Reporting (06/13/14)\n\nAnytime the hobble restraint device is used, officers' Use of Force reporting shall document the circumstances requiring the use of the restraint and the technique applied, regardless of whether an injury was incurred.\n\nSupervisors shall complete a Supervisor's Force Review.\n\nWhen the Maximal Restraint Technique is used, officers' report shall document the following:\n\nHow the MRT was applied, listing the hobble restraint device as the implement used.\n\nThe approximate amount of time the subject was restrained.\n\nHow the subject was transported and the position of the subject.\n\nObservations of the subject's physical and physiological actions (examples include: significant changes in behavior, consciousness or medical issues).\n\nLet's go through the problems with Hughes's analysis one by one.\n\nFirst, the MRT was not as Hughes puts it, \"a hold that Chauvin, along with the entire MPD, was trained to do in precisely this kind of situation.\" The MRT was taught as a temporary hold to be used only long enough for police officers to administer a restraint device called a hobble.\n\nThis is what a hobble looks like:\n\nOnce the hobble is in place, the policy requires officers to move the suspect onto his side and into the \"recovery position\" \"as soon as reasonably possible.\"\n\nIn other words, the entire reason the MPD taught the MRT -- the only reason it was included in the MPD manual -- was to incapacitate a suspect, but only long enough for police to administer a hobble, which is less dangerous, after which they were to immediately allow the suspect to recover.\n\nThis is a problem for Chauvin, because he never used a hobble on Floyd. He and the other officers discussed using one at various points over the nine minutes, but they never did.\n\nSo even if we concede that the hold Chauvin used on Floyd is the MRT described in the manual (it isn't), it was only supposed to be used briefly, and only to incapacitate a suspect long enough to use a device that Chauvin never used. The MRT was not intended -- and neither Chauvin nor anyone else was ever trained in it -- for use on a handcuffed, prone suspect for nine minutes.\n\nSecond, the very first point in the MPD policy manual's discussion of MRT states that it \"shall only be used in situations where handcuffed subjects are combative and still pose a threat to themselves, officers or others, or could cause significant damage to property if not properly restrained.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd clearly did not want to be arrested. He argued, pleaded, and filibustered. He passively resisted. He was scared, and was probably high. But it's a stretch at best to say he posed a threat. He never struck, threatened, or harmed an officer or bystander. The defense claimed Floyd was a threat because of his size and the fact that he appeared to be on drugs. But police officers aren't permitted to use force on a suspect because he might be a threat. He needs to actually exhibit threatening behavior.\n\nThird, let's return to the portion of the manual instructing police to roll suspects into a recovery position \"as soon as reasonably possible.\"\n\nFloyd was not visibly struggling against Chauvin once he was taken to the ground. Over the next several minutes, Floyd told Chauvin more than 20 times that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin ignored all of these pleas but one, to which he responded, \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\"\n\n(Chauvin's comment echoes a common retort from officers when a suspect pleads that he is unable to breathe - \"If you can talk, you can breathe.\" This is incorrect .)\n\nAfter six minutes, Floyd became unresponsive. He then went limp. At this point, bystanders began to plead with Chauvin to remove his knee.\n\n\"He's not responsive right now, bro,\" one man said. \"Check his pulse right now and tell me what is,\" said a woman, who then again demanded, \"tell me what his pulse is right now.\"\n\nAt about this point, Chauvin had the following exchange with Officer Thomas Lane:\n\nLane: Should we roll him on his side?\n\nChauvin: No, he's staying put where we got him.\n\nLane: Okay. Just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.\n\nChauvin: Well that's why we got the ambulance coming.\n\nLane: Okay, I suppose.\n\nWhen Lane asked Chauvin the same question a couple minutes later -\"Should we roll him on his side?\" - Chauvin didn't respond.\n\nNext, Officer J. Alexander Kueng then told Chauvin that he couldn't find Floyd's pulse. Onlookers continued to plead with Chauvin to remove his knee.\n\n\"Bro, he's not fucking moving,\" one said. \"Get the fuck off him. What are you doing? He's dying,\" said another. And then still another, \"He's not even fucking moving. Get off his fucking neck, bro. Get off of his neck.\"\n\nChauvin ignored all of them. After Floyd went limp, Chauvin kept his weight on him for another three minutes.\n\nThe Watch is a reader-supported publication. If you find this work important, please consider becoming a paid subscriber.\n\nAs soon as is reasonably possible is a subjective phrase. But even if you think Chauvin's hold on Floyd is indistinguishable from the MRT once taught by MPD (and again, it isn't), and even if you think Floyd was a threat to the officers or to bystanders (and again, I don't think he was), surely once Floyd was unresponsive, once he'd gone limp, once he showed no sign of a pulse - surely then he was well past the point at which it was \"reasonably possible\" to turn Floyd on his side.\n\nIt's just wildly dishonest for Hughes to not mention any of this.\n\nHughes conveniently provides a link to the 2023 version of the MPD manual, so you can click over to see that MRT has now been banned. But he does not link to the 2014 version I've excerpted above. This is curious. He doesn't link to the version of the manual that Chauvin was allegedly trained on, that lays out the MRT procedures, and from which Hughes and the documentary selectively quote to argue for Chauvin's innocence.\n\nWhy would that be? The charitable explanation is that Hughes was unable to find the 2014 version online. This seems implausible, for a few reasons. First, I was able to find the old policy with a quick Google search. Second, if we are to take Hughes at his word that he's a \"confirm the documents myself\" kind of guy, surely he looked up the old policy instead of merely taking the documentary's characterization of it at face value. But finally, and most importantly, Hughes quotes from the 2014 policy in his piece . So he clearly read it.\n\nThis leaves us with a less charitable explanation for why Hughes wouldn't provide a link: He didn't want you to see the portion that clearly contradicts the point he's trying to make.\n\nHughes also doesn't address that the hobble was the purpose of the MRT at all. The word hobble doesn't appear in his column.\n\nBut TFOM producers Chaix and Collin did attempt an explanation for all of this, albeit a preposterous one. In an interview with Glenn Loury's The Glenn Show , they seize on some imprecise wording from the 2014 MPD manual to argue the following: Chauvin could not have violated the department's MRT policy because while the manual does say, \"If the hobble restraint device is used, the person shall be placed in the side recovery position,\" the policy is silent on what officers should do if they use MRT but do not use a hobble.\n\nThere's an obvious reason for this \"omission\" - the manual doesn't authorize MRT for any purpose other than to administer a hobble. Chaix and Collin are suggesting that the authors of the 2014 manual were concerned enough over the risks of MRT that they required any officer who used it for its authorized purpose to move a suspect into the recovery position after doing so, but also deliberately left officers free to do whatever they want if they use the hold for a non-authorized purpose.\n\nThis is just not a plausible reading of the manual. Or of any manual. Or of the entire purpose of manuals.\n\nThere's one more important piece of context to all of this: There's a reason why the MPD manual explicitly warns of cardiac arrest and instructs officers to roll suspects into a recovery position. In 2010, a man named David Smith died under very similar circumstances. Smith died while lying face-down with an MPD officer's knee in his back. Like Chauvin, the officer continued to put his weight on Smith even after Smith became unresponsive.\n\nSmith's family settled their lawsuit against the city for $3 million. Part of the settlement was a requirement that MPD provide better training on positional asphyxia and the importance of rolling suspects into a recovery position as soon as possible.\n\nNext, Hughes, TFOM, and pundits like Carlson have made a big deal of the fact that the judge at Chauvin's trial refused to let jurors see a PowerPoint slide that they claim proves Chauvin's hold on Floyd was taught by MPD. When Chauvin's defenders discuss this issue, they'll often show the training slide and a photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd side by side. Here, for example, is a screen grab from the documentary. Chauvin is, of course, the photo on the left. The photo on the right is from the training slide.\n\nHere's Hughes:\n\nWhatʼs more, an MPD training presentation created and shown to academy recruits in 2018 includes a slide showing an officer performing a hold very similar to the one Chauvin used on Floyd.\n\nAt his trial, Chauvinʼs lawyers wanted to show the jury the above photo from the MPD PowerPoint slide.\n\nBut the prosecution moved to exclude it, and Judge Cahill agreed. Their reason was that Chauvin could not prove that he had been personally trained on that photo. But this rationale does not survive scrutiny. In the documentary, six current and former MPD police officers affirm that the MRT was indeed standard training-training they had received themselves. When asked if he was trained on MRT, Rich Walker, an African American MPD sergeant with 19 years on the force, replied: \"Yes, all the police officers were trained in MRT.\"\n\nBody cam footage shows that, as the officers were taking Floyd out of the squad car, Officer Thomas Lane verbally recommended that they implement the MRT (though he misspoke and called it \"MRE\"). If Officer Lane, who had been on the force for less than a week, was aware of MRT, then it defies belief to think Chauvin, a veteran of almost twenty years, was unaware of it-regardless of which particular material heʼd been trained on.\n\nIt isn't hard to see why the defense wanted the jury to see the photo from the slide. And if you look only at the photos, and if TFOM is your only source of information about these photos, you might think the two photos depict the same tactic.\n\nBut let's look at the photos more closely. Note that in the slide photo, the officer is shifting his weight backward, and most of his weight is on his heel. Note the clear tension that his weight creates on his toes and the ball of his foot. Only his knee is on the suspect, and his body is off to the side. Here's a close-up from that portion of the photo:\n\nNow look at \"Exhibit 17,\" the photo of Chauvin that was used at trial. He's upright, and none of his weight is resting on his foot. His toe is positioned in a way that shifts more of his weight onto Floyd.\n\nHere's the diagram that the state's pulmonologist used at Chauvin's trial:\n\nMPD officials testified at the trial that officers were taught that the MRT requires \"light to moderate pressure.\" According to the autopsy report, Floyd had bruises and abrasions on his left shoulder and the left side of his forehead, cheek, and mouth. This is the side of his body that Chauvin ground into the pavement. Floyd also had abrasions on his nose.\n\nThe documentary doesn't mention any of this. Nor does Hughes.\n\nBut just as Hughes and the documentary do, I've been holding something back from you. The training slide that Chauvin's defenders want you to think exonerates him? It also has text. It's big, easy to read text. And that text is incredibly damning.\n\nHere's the full slide with the text included:\n\nIt's just gobsmacking that anyone could read the text above and think this slide is remotely exculpatory for Chauvin.\n\nThe text not only tells officers to be cautious of cardiac arrest because it can be common after a struggle with police, like the 2014 MPD manual, it also instructs officers to \"place the subject in the recovery position to alleviate positional asphyxia.\"\n\nThis is probably why the documentary only shows the full slide only for a fraction of a second before it zooms in on the photo. This has the beneficial effect of pushing the text offscreen before viewers can read it.\n\nThere's a reason that text is on the slide. Preventing positional asphyxia isn't about making suspects comfortable. It isn't a courtesy. It's about life and death.\n\nI'll discuss this more in my next post about the autopsy, but generally speaking, positional asphyxia occurs when someone is stuck in a position that restricts their ability to breathe. In Floyd's case, medical expert witnesses for the prosecution told jurors that the weight Chauvin put on Floyd's back and neck restricted his ability to expand his chest and diaphragm. This limited both his oxygen intake and his ability to expel carbon dioxide. So Floyd was starved of oxygen even as CO2 built up in his blood, a lethal combination that ultimately resulted in cardiac arrest.\n\nThis sort of in-custody death is not uncommon. Back in 2020, USA Today found more than 130 incidents over the last decade in which someone died in police custody from positional asphyxia. The paper pointed out that this is almost certainly an undercount, given how little scrutiny we give to in-custody deaths. There's also some new research suggesting that many deaths wrongly attributed to the dubious diagnosis of \"excited delirium\" may have actually been caused by positional asphyxia.\n\nRemarkably, toward the end of his piece, Hughes just casually brushes all of this aside. He writes:\n\n. . . you could make the case that Chauvin departed from his training by failing to roll Floyd onto his side-into what the MPD use-of-force manual calls the \"side recovery position\"-once he lost consciousness. But that error may or may not have amounted to a crime, and surely would not have amounted to felony murder.\n\nThis is astonishingly glib. Hughes essentially characterizes a policy put in place to prevent unnecessary death as little more than a suggestion.\n\nRecall that the 2014 MPD manual did not call for officers to roll suspects over \"once they've lost consciousness.\" It called for them to roll suspects over as soon as reasonably possible . It did so because four years earlier, a man died because police officers failed to do so.\n\nOnce you've lost consciousness, you've already been starved of oxygen. This is why most departments (including MPD, according to trial testimony) instruct officers to constantly monitor a suspect's breathing and responsiveness. A loss of consciousness would be the absolute latest possible warning, the most obvious, big honking red flag telling an officer that it's time to roll a suspect over. At that point, there is zero chance of resistance. There is no threat to police or bystanders.\n\nYet Chauvin continued to deprive Floyd of oxygen another three minutes after he went limp. And not only did he fail to monitor Floyd's breathing, he ignored warnings from both bystanders and a colleague that Floyd was in peril.\n\nThis is why the pulmonologist who testified for the state said that even a perfectly healthy person would likely have died under such conditions.\n\nSo here we have two very different interpretations of the same policy. I think one is orders of magnitude more plausible than the other. Hughes clearly does not. But as the sort of writer who prefaces his columns with assertions that he \"confirms the documents,\" you'd think he might consult other authorities - other documents - to see which interpretation is correct. The most obvious authority here would be other police manuals.\n\nIf Hughes had been curious enough, for example, he might have found this manual from the Orange County, California, Sheriff's Department:\n\nOnce secured, the person should be placed in a seated or upright position and shall not be placed on his/her stomach for an extended period as this may potentially reduce the person's ability to breathe . . .\n\n. . . The deputy is to ensure the person does not roll onto and remain on his/her stomach\n\n. . .  The deputy is to look for signs of labored breathing and, where practical, take appropriate steps to relieve and minimize any obvious factors contributing to this condition.\n\nHe might have found countless tweets like those below, from cops who were stunned at what they saw in the George Floyd video:\n\nHe might also have consulted the manual of the LAPD, the third largest police department in the U.S., which says that \"as soon as practical\" after administering a hobble, officers should \"place the individual in an upright, seated position.\"\n\nHe might have consulted the manual of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, the largest sheriff's department in the country, which says this:\n\n\"Positional asphyxia\" means situating a person in a manner that compresses their airway and reduces the likelihood that they will be able to breathe normally.  This includes, without limitation, the use of any physical restraint technique, device or position that causes a person's respiratory airway to be compressed or impairs the person's breathing or respiratory capacity.  This also includes any technique in which pressure or bodyweight is unreasonably applied against a restrained person's neck, torso, or positioning a restrained person in a prone or supine position without proper monitoring for signs of asphyxia.\n\nIf he looked hard enough, Hughes might have also discovered that as long ago as 1995, the NYPD policy manual warned: \"As soon as the subject is handcuffed, get him off his stomach. Turn him on his side or place him in a seated position. If he continues to struggle, do not sit on his back . Hold his legs down or wrap his legs with a strap.\"\n\nThe italics are not mine. They're in the document itself.\n\nHere's a 2003 training video, also from the NYPD, that even diagrams how positional asphyxia works.\n\nBack in 1995, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a bulletin to police departments that warned about positional asphyxiation. \"As soon as the suspect is handcuffed,\" it read, \"get him off his stomach.\"\n\nHughes might have also found a training bulletin that the Chicago PD issued to officers in 1999, which warned that \"positional asphyxia can occur when a subject's chest is restricted from expanding properly or the position of the subject's head obstructs the airway. Officers should never . . . put weight on the subject's back for a prolonged period.\"\n\nOr he might have found this article on the pro-law enforcement site Police1 - eight months before Floyd's death - warning about the danger of asphyxia in suspects who are handcuffed while face down.\n\nOr this advice from Lexipol , the private company that has written policies for more U.S. police departments than any other entity.\n\nPositional asphyxia is a serious condition that can become life threatening with little warning . . .\n\nPositional Asphyxia becomes more likely when the person is restrained with their arms behind the back and in a stomach-down position. This is a risk no matter if they are on the ground or in the back of a patrol car or transport van.\n\nTo prevent positional asphyxia, get a person off their stomach and into the seated position as soon as practical. In the patrol car, make sure they are in an upright position and check their status frequently. Make frequent wellbeing checks and make sure they are not allowed to lay face down for any length of time.\n\nHughes might have also found any of the myriad reports after Floyd's death about in-custody deaths from positional asphyxia, most of which found that police departments have been warning about it for years, and most of which included quotes like this one, which a law enforcement trainer gave to the A.P. :\n\nEvery department has policies on this. Every law enforcement agency trains their officers, advises them, cautions them on this very restraint issue - positional asphyxia.\n\nOr he might have found this NPR piece about the 2010 death of David Smith at the hands of the MPD, which includes this quote from another officer who trains cops on restraint techniques: \"We ought to have it stamped, or maybe a tattoo, on the back of our hand, that as soon as the person is subdued or restrained, then get off them.... get them into an upright position or on their side to facilitate breathing.\"\n\nSo to sum up, it's true that until recently, the Minneapolis Police Department trained officers in something called the Maximal Restraint Technique. In it, officers were instructed to use a knee to apply light to moderate pressure on the back of a suspect who posed a threat to police, others, or themselves. But the knee was to be applied only for a short period of time - specifically, only long enough to apply a hobble - after which officers were to turn the suspect on his side as soon as reasonably possible. They were also taught to be aware of positional asphyxia, to be alert to the possibility of cardiac arrest, and to monitor suspects the entire time.\n\nDerek Chauvin put approximately half his weight on George Floyd's back for around five minutes, and then shifted his weight onto Floyd's neck for an additional four - for a total of nine minutes. Chauvin never used a hobble. He never moved Floyd to a recovery position. And even after Floyd was unresponsive, had gone limp, and showed no sign of a pulse - even as onlookers pleaded with Chauvin that he was killing Floyd and fellow officers told him Floyd had no pulse and suggested rolling him onto his side - Chauvin continued to put his weight on Floyd for another three minutes.\n\nChauvin's use of force on Floyd was not a simple error. It was not a \"departure from policy.\" It was callous disregard for another man's life. It was blithe indifference to George Floyd's humanity.\n\nDespite the fact that most police departments recognize that positional asphyxia is real, dangerous, and potentially lethal, Hughes and TFOM next use - and misuse - statements from actual police officers and officials to blur the line between MRT and Chauvin's hold on Floyd.\n\nHughes, for example, points out that the documentary interviews six officers who say they were trained on MRT. This is only damning if you think the method Chauvin used to hold Floyd down isn't significantly different than MRT. And if your first exposure to all of this is Hughe's column, you probably do think this, because Hughes has already told you as much.\n\nYet despite his reputation as an independent thinker, Hughes is doing little more than regurgitating the documentary, here. That's unfortunate, because the documentary is strikingly dishonest.\n\nWhen addressing the MRT issue, for example, TFOM shows short clips from the trial testimony of MPD inspector Katie Blackwell and former MPD chief Medaria Arradondo, who led the department from 2017 through 2022. It then blows what they said completely out of context.\n\nIn researching this post, I came across the YouTube video below, which was posted by an account called Willemedia. It breaks down how TFOM dishonestly clips the testimony of these two MPD officials. I don't know who runs the account, so I can't vouch for this person's credibility more generally. However, I think this particular section speaks for itself, and I include it here because I didn't want to take credit for the legwork someone else has done.\n\nIn the first clip used by TFOM, a prosecutor asks Blackwell - who previously oversaw MPD's training - if the technique depicted in \"Exhibit 17\" is an approved MPD technique. Again, remember that Exhibit 17 is a photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd.\n\nShe answers, \"It is not.\" TFOM then skips over a good chunk of what she says next, and cuts to something she says later: \"I don't know what kind of improvised position that is. So it's not what we train.\" This is the only portion of Blackwell's testimony that TFOM shows.\n\nIn the portion that the documentary skips, Blackwell explains the myriad ways that what Chauvin is doing to Floyd in Exhibit 17 departs from MPD training and policy. TFOM producers don't want you to see this, because it destroys the core contention of their entire argument - the false claim that what Chauvin did to Floyd is indistinguishable from MRT. You can see both Blackwell's full answer and the way TFOM edits it in the Willemedia video above.\n\nIn the second clip, a prosecutor poses a similar question to former chief Arradondo: Is what Chauvin is doing to Floyd in Exhibit 17 part of MPD training? He answers that it is not. The documentary then quickly cuts to Chauvin's mother, who says that when she heard that answer from Arradando, she wanted to jump off her chair and yell \"Bullshit!\"\n\nHere's that portion of TFOM:\n\nWhat the documentary doesn't show is the portion of Arradondo's testimony in which he explained at length what we've already covered here. He described MRT, how it was trained, and that the MPD authorized officers to use the technique solely for the purpose of applying a hobble.\n\nFor some reason, I'm not able embed the video below to begin at the correct time stamp, but jump to 1:16:45 to see Arradondo discuss MRT.\n\nLike Hughes, the documentary wants you to think that MRT and Chauvin's hold on Floyd are one and the same. It wants you to think that each time an MPD official denied on the stand that officers had been trained to do what Chauvin did to Floyd, they were lying. It wants you to think they were talking about MRT.\n\nThis is all shamelessly dishonest. But it gets worse. On at least two occasions, the documentary just flat out lies about all of this.\n\nThe first lie begins when Collin interviews Chauvin about MRT. We then get the montage Hughes mentions, as several MPD officers confirm to Collin that they were personally trained in MRT. Again, this is only scandalous if you think the MRT and Chauvin's hold on Floyd are the same maneuver.\n\nAfter the montage, the camera cuts to Collin, who is face to face with one additional MPD officer.\"Your police chief said on the stand that he didn't recognize that technique,\" Collin says.\n\nThe officer replies, \"Mmm hmm. I heard him say that. It's tough to hear people lie. Just straight lie.\"\n\nHere's that portion of the documentary. (Note that this is also the part that shows the MRT training slide, then quickly zooms in to the photo to crop out the damning text.)\n\nSo Collin sets up a false premise by showing cop after cop affirming they were taught MRT. She then asks one officer how she felt when her chief said in court that he didn't recognize \"that technique.\" But the technique he \"didn't recognize\" isn't MRT. It's what Chauvin was doing to Floyd.\n\nAs the officer goes on, the documentary flashes to the portion of an MPD policy manual that addresses MRT and spends a few seconds on some introductory language about the need to subdue combative and threatening suspects. It then cuts to a more recent version of the manual. Amusingly, for a split second, the documentary actually shows the portion of the manual that says MRT should only be used to administer a hobble, but not long enough for viewers to actually read it. It then quickly pans up to the corner, where someone has highlighted the fact that the policy on MRT has been updated several times over the last decade. The documentary lingers here for few seconds. This is what you're supposed to be looking at - the fact that MPD has not only trained officers on MRT, but has revised the training several times.\n\nBut even here, you can catch a glimpse of what they're not telling you - the portion of the manual that makes clear that MRT is only to be used for administering a hobble.\n\nI took a screen shot:\n\nThis glimpse, which I suspect was an editing oversight, is the closest the documentary comes to addressing the fact that MRT was taught only for the purpose of administering a hobble.\n\nThe second lie comes toward the end of this portion of the documentary. Collin, again referring to the testimony current and former MPD officials gave at Chauvin's trial, says, \"Several of those witnesses claimed that MRT . . . was not a part of Minneapolis police policy.\"\n\nThis is just false, and it's hard to see how Collin wouldn't know that it's false. MPD officials never testified that the department didn't teach MRT. They said that the technique depicted in Exhibit 17 - the photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd - wasn't MPD policy. Because it wasn't.\n\nFinally, Hughes and TFOM make a big deal of the fact that Judge Peter Cahill didn't let the jury see the MRT slide at Chauvin's trial.\n\nHere's Hughes again:\n\nAt his trial, Chauvinʼs lawyers wanted to show the jury the above photo from the MPD PowerPoint slide. But the prosecution moved to exclude it, and Judge Cahill agreed. Their reason was that Chauvin could not prove that he had been personally trained on that photo. But this rationale does not survive scrutiny. In the documentary, six current and former MPD police officers affirm that the MRT was indeed standard training-training they had received themselves. When asked if he was trained on MRT, Rich Walker, an African American MPD sergeant with 19 years on the force, replied: \"Yes, all the police officers were trained in MRT.\"\n\nNote that the officers in the documentary don't say the slide was part of their training. They only say they were trained on MRT.\n\nBut the implication here, which is also a common talking point among the right-wing personalities who obsess over this stuff, is that Cahill's refusal to allow the slide into evidence is more proof that Chauvin's trial was rigged from the start.\n\nHere's what actually happened: Every court in the country requires attorneys to establish a foundation before presenting a piece of evidence to a jury. You have to show why the evidence is relevant. This is not controversial. It's taught in every law school, and the bar here is pretty low. If the slide had indeed been part of Chauvin's training, it shouldn't have been difficult for his defense team to present it.\n\nThe easiest way to do this would have been to call Chauvin to the stand and simply ask him if he'd been trained on the slide. That would have been more than enough. They could also have called anyone who had gone through the training at the same time as Chauvin.\n\nThey didn't do either of those things. For Chauvin at least, there's a good reason the defense wouldn't have called him to testify. Defense attorneys rarely ask defendants to testify because it would subject them to cross-examination.\n\nBut the defense couldn't find anyone else to say Chauvin had been trained on the slide, either. Because he hadn't.\n\nFrom the state's reply brief in Chauvin's appeal:\n\nBut the evidence indicates that Chauvin did not witness the original event at which this photograph was taken, that he did not view the presentation in which it was included during his time as an MPD officer, and that he did not see this slide or the photograph at any time prior to George Floyd's death.  As Officer Nicole Mackenzie, the MPD officer \"in the best position to speak to\" the slide and the photograph, has explained, the individuals depicted in the photo are not \"Minneapolis Police Officers\" and are \"not in Minneapolis Police uniform.\"  And Chauvin would not have received the training in which this image was included.\n\nThat training \"was originally created in 2018 for the MPD Academy\" and was shown to \"Cades and Recruits . . . while they are participating in the MPD Academy.\"  Officer Mackenzie indicated, however, that \"this presentation\" has never \"been included in the in-service training\" provided \"for the purpose of continuing education\" for existing officers.  As a result, Chauvin would never have seen or been trained using this slide or photograph prior to Floyd's death.\n\nTellingly, in his appeal, Chauvin's attorneys abandon the claim that their client was trained on the slide. I suspect this is because they knew it wasn't true.\n\nInstead, they made a different argument . They argue that the mere fact that the slide was part of any training material proves that what Chauvin did to Floyd was reasonable, and therefore not a crime. From their brief:\n\nRegardless of whether Chauvin was trained on this technique or not, the issue is whether it was \"objectively reasonable\" for him to restrain Floyd by putting his knees on Floyd's back.  Whether Chauvin saw the training materials is not relevant-the issue is whether Chauvin's use of his knee on Floyd's back was reasonable and the fact that MPD training materials actually contained the above picture approving such a technique is evidence tending to show Chauvin's use of his knee was reasonable.\n\nThis is worth some emphasis: Hughes and the documentary producers are advancing an argument that Chauvin's own lawyers abandoned in his appeal. Hughes himself even links to the defense filing above. So even as he's arguing that Chauvin must have been trained in MRT, he links to a filing that all but concedes this it isn't true. (This seems like a good example of why you should always \"confirm the documents\" before relying on them!)\n\nAs for the argument Chauvin falls back on in his appeal, I think at this point we've pretty well established why the slide does not establish the \"reasonableness\" of what Chauvin did to Floyd. But I'll recite it once more: The two holds aren't similar. Chauvin put far more weight on Floyd than MPD teaches, he utilized the hold for a much longer period of time than MPD teaches, and he failed to employ the potentially lifesaving steps that MPD teaches.\n\nOne more thing on this point: Recall that Hughes makes hay of the fact that one officer on the scene at the time of Floyd's death - Officer Thomas Lane - had only been on the force for a week. Hughes brings this up in an attempt to defend Chauvin. But Lane's role in all of this is actually quite damning for Chauvin.\n\nHere's why: Hughes writes, \"If Officer Lane, who had been on the force for less than a week, was aware of MRT, then it defies belief to think Chauvin, a veteran of almost twenty years, was unaware of it.\"\n\nHughes makes this point in the context of discussing this allegedly exculpatory training slide. He's arguing that if a rookie like Lane had seen the slide, then Chauvin must have seen it as well.\n\nAfter \"confirming the documents,\" we now know that this too isn't true. The slide was created in 2018, and was only used to train recruits and cadets at the MPD academy. So while it seems likely that Chauvin was trained in MRT, the slide could not have been part of that training.\n\nAnd ironically, because of this, we also know that of all the officers on the scene when Floyd died, only one probably saw the slide during his training: Thomas Lane. He's the only officer who would have been a cadet when that slide was part of the MPD's academy training.\n\nWhat else do we know about Thomas Lane?  Well, we know that he was the one officer on the scene who seemed to understand how important it is to roll a suspect into the recovery position. Recall that it was Lane who twice urged Chauvin to remove his knee and roll Floyd onto his side. And both times, Chauvin refused.\n\nChauvin's defenders want him to benefit from a photo on a training slide because they think it looks vaguely similar to the hold he put on Floyd. But they only want you to look at the photo superficially. They don't want you to look at it carefully enough to see how the photos are different. And they definitely don't want you to notice the text on the slide emphasizing the dangerousness of the hold, how important it is for any officer who deploys it to also take necessary, potentially lifesaving precautions, and the fact that the entire reason that text exists - both on the side and in the manual - is because MPD officers killed a man 10 years earlier using that very technique.\n\nThey also want you to disregard those warnings despite the fact that, according to medical experts, Chauvin's failure to heed them is precisely why George Floyd is dead.\n\nThe Minnesota Court of Appeals wasn't impressed with the training slide argument. Here's what a panel from the court wrote when they unanimously rejected Chauvin's bid to overturn his conviction last April.\n\nChauvin cannot demonstrate that the exclusion of the slide prejudiced him.  The text on the slide explicitly instructed the officers to \"[p]lace the subject in the recovery position to alleviate positional asphyxia\" when using MRT. As a result, even if admitted, the evidence would have further shown that Chauvin failed to follow the MPD training and used unreasonable force. Chauvin's argument fails.\n\nChauvin has since appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Both declined to review his conviction.\n\nUp next, I'll look at the erroneous claim that George Floyd died of natural causes, and not because of the weight Derek Chauvin put on his back and neck for nine minutes.\n\nHere's a quick preview: Coleman Hughes does not appear to have \"confirmed the documents.\"\n\n(Addendum: Hughes has responded to this series. You can read my response to him here .)\n\nThis is why Radley is absolutely indispensible.\n\nGotta love the \"honest intellectual\" putting out shocking lies like that.\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?"

      "text": "Study: George Floyd Protests Did Not Cause Mass Exodus of Police Officers\n\nPolitics\n\nJoe Lancaster | 7.8.2024 4:35 PM\n\nDid the social justice protests of 2020 cause a wave of police officers to leave the force? A recent study suggests the truth may not be so simple.\n\nIn May 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by pinning him to the ground with his knee. When video of the encounter circulated online, the image of a white police officer nonchalantly kneeling atop a black man until he asphyxiated ignited a powder keg: Americans, stir-crazy from sheltering in place for the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, took to the streets to protest police brutality, in some cases violently .\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that amid a nationwide spike in crime and mounting protests in which demonstrators proclaimed that \"all cops are bastards,\" many officers simply gave in. \"As anger bubbles in parts of the country, some US police departments are facing their own crises and some officers have now opted to walk away,\" CNN reported in June 2020, less than a month after Floyd's death.\n\n\"The law enforcement community is suffering in a year that began with a global pandemic and is now seeing significant social upheaval,\" Police1 reported in October 2020. \"In just a few short months, officers went from being lauded as essential workers to working amid a social discourse that paints all officers in a negative light.\"\n\nA June 2021 survey from the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) found a 45 percent increase in retirements in 2020-2021 when compared to the previous year, as well as an 18 percent rise in resignations.\n\nBut a new study from Duke University law professor Ben Grunwald challenges this narrative. To assess the validity of the claim that officers resigned en masse after the 2020 protests, Grunwald collected data \"on every job held by every officer in all 6,800 local law enforcement agencies across fifteen states that, together, cover half the U.S. population.\" That database came to encompass over 972,000 officers between the mid-1990s and 2022, though for the study, he focused only on 2011-2021.\n\nGrunwald found that \"the increase in separations\" among those agencies \"after the summer of 2020 was smaller, later, less sudden, and possibly less pervasive than the retention-crisis narrative suggests.\"\n\n\"Separations were nearly stable in 2020 compared to the year before,\" he writes, while \"in 2021, separations increased by historically large numbers but substantially less than the most widely reported figures for that period.\" Specifically, separations in 2020 increased \"by less than 1% compared to 2019\" while they \"rose far more in 2021, by 18% relative to 2019.\" Grunwald notes that while this increase \"was historically unusual, larger than any two-year period in the previous decade,\" it is also much smaller than the 2021 PERF study suggested, and about one-third of it \"can be explained by pre-existing trends that long predate the events of 2020.\"\n\n\"All told, the cumulative effect on aggregate employment by the end of 2021 was just 1%,\" Grunwald concludes. \"This was not because of increased lateral mobility [officers transferring to another department or another role within law enforcement], as some have wondered. Rather, [the database] shows that the vast majority of excess separations in 2021 were by officers leaving the field, at least for a while.\" He does acknowledge, though, that \"a substantial minority of large departments [those with 500 or more officers] were meaningfully hit, losing over 5% of staff by the end of 2021.\"\n\nAs to why officers chose to leave when they did, Grunwald conceded that he was unable to test for factors like \"social hostility\" or criticism from city leaders making officers feel unsupported. But he did examine \"whether the intensity of local protests affected local separations,\" comparing police separation rates with the reported attendance numbers for over 9,800 protests during the summer of 2020. \"The results,\" Grunwald concluded, \"provide no evidence that more intense political activism caused more separations among agencies with the highest protest intensity.\"\n\nInstead, Grunwald proposes four possible alternatives for an uptick in officer resignations. \"The first is economic ,\" he writes. \"Like workers in other fields, officers quit for better compensation, benefits, training, and opportunities for promotion-particularly in periods of economic growth....The U.S. job market surged dramatically in the first half of 2021, with monthly job openings rising 70% by the end of the year.\" In June 2021, the same month that the PERF survey found a huge spike in officer retirements and resignations, The New York Times ran an article headlined \"Why Police Have Been Quitting in Droves in the Last Year.\" Focusing on the Asheville Police Department as a microcosm of the national trend, the article noted that officers felt increasingly \"demoralized\" but also noted that the starting salary was $37,000, not nearly enough to buy a house in the city.\n\nAnother potential factor Grunwald identified was the pandemic itself, not only that officers had to contend with \"personal obligations, like family or childcare\" but also \"burnout\" as \"the pandemic amplified old stressors and created new ones.\"\n\nGrunwald also suggests that political activism may have contributed to officer attrition, either as a result of demoralizing protests or pressures for reform, though \"this timing is also consistent with the pandemic\" and cannot be easily separated.\n\nFinally, he suggests that demographic shifts may have played a role, as a large number of officers who were already approaching retirement age, hired either as part of the baby boom generation or after the 1994 crime bill, may have taken the opportunity to go ahead and call it quits. The Marshall Project reported in January 2023 that while some cities and counties struggled to staff their police departments in the years since 2020, those same jurisdictions were having a hard time finding \"firefighters, bus drivers and other government workers\" as the overall job market rebounded.\n\nThere are other plausible explanations as well. Fordham University law professor John Pfaff noted that \"a cop's annual pension payout is a function of their total income-not base wages, but wages PLUS OVERTIME-of their final few years.\" In Atlanta, officer overtime pay doubled in 2020 ; Chicago paid out over $177 million in overtime that year, a 27 percent increase over the year before.\n\nGrunwald's results will not alleviate every concern about the current state of policing-his data cannot address, for example, whether or not police officers are \" quiet quitting ,\" staying on the job but only expending a bare-minimum effort. But it does demonstrate that, despite recent fearmongering, the protests of 2020 likely did not cause cops to flee to the exits in droves.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Derek Chauvin's Belief That George Floyd Was Intoxicated Does Not Help His Case\n\nGeorge Floyd\n\nJacob Sullum | 4.1.2021 4:55 PM\n\nAfter paramedics removed George Floyd's body from the scene of his fatal arrest on May 25, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin defended his use of force in a conversation with a bystander. \"We got to control this guy, because he's a sizable guy, and it looks like he's probably on something,\" Chauvin told Charles McMillian in a body camera video that was played for jurors in Chauvin's murder trial yesterday.\n\nMcMillian testified that Chauvin was responding to his criticism of the way the officer had treated Floyd, who was handcuffed and lying facedown on the pavement as Chauvin knelt on his neck. According to prosecutors, Chauvin maintained that position for more than nine minutes, despite Floyd's repeated complaints that he was having trouble breathing. Chauvin kept his knee there even after concerned bystanders repeatedly warned that Floyd's life was in danger, even after another officer repeatedly suggested that Floyd should be rolled onto his side in light of his \"excited delirium,\" even after Floyd was no longer responsive, even after Chauvin was repeatedly told that Floyd had no detectable pulse, and even after the ambulance arrived.\n\nChauvin said that use of force was justified because he and his colleagues were dealing with \"a sizable guy\" who seemed to be intoxicated. Former Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao, who is charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin's assault on Floyd and will be tried separately, shared that impression. \"This is why you don't do drugs, kids,\" he jocularly told bystanders as Chauvin knelt on Floyd.\n\nAfter Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng arrested him for buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, Floyd panicked and struggled with them as they tried to place him in their squad car, saying he was claustrophobic, complaining that he could not breathe, and asking if he could ride in the front seat. Chauvin apparently thought Floyd was behaving that way because he was on drugs. But that consideration should have underlined the danger of the prone restraint he used.\n\nThe evidence indicates that Floyd had ingested black-market \"Percocet\" tablets that contained fentanyl and methamphetamine, and an autopsy report from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said both drugs were detected in his blood. The report still classified Floyd's death as a homicide, saying it was caused by \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, nevertheless argues that the drugs were partly responsible for Floyd's death, which he attributes to \"a cardiac arrhythmia that occurred as a result of hypertension, his coronary disease, the ingestion of methamphetamine and fentanyl, and the adrenaline flowing through his body, all of which acted to further compromise an already compromised heart.\"\n\nNelson says Floyd continued to resist even after he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by Chauvin, Lane, and Kueng. But judging from a bystander video of the encounter, Floyd's resistance was limited to moving his head and right shoulder (consistent with his complaint that he could not breathe) and begging for mercy. In any case, Floyd's apparent intoxication should have counted against the restraint technique that Chauvin used rather than in its favor.\n\nLane, the officer who suggested that Floyd should be rolled off his stomach, offered this reason: \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever.\" The same concern figured in a 1998 case involving a man who died in police custody. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit held that police force can be excessive \"when a drug-affected person in a state of excited delirium is hog-tied and placed face down in a prone position,\" which \"may present a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm.\" Although Floyd was not hog-tied, the obvious stress caused by the prone restraint plausibly contributed to the \"adrenaline flowing through his body\" and the \"cardiac arrhythmia\" described by Nelson-even if you rule out asphyxia, as Nelson does.\n\nThe prosecution, meanwhile, argues that Floyd's breathing was obstructed, so much so that it caused \"an anoxic seizure.\" But either way, Chauvin's actions can hardly be viewed as irrelevant to Floyd's death, even if there were other contributing factors.\n\nChauvin is charged with unintentional second-degree murder , which applies to someone who \"causes the death of a human being, without intent to effect the death of any person, while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense\"-in this case, third-degree assault . To prove causation, the prosecution need only persuade the jury that Floyd would not have died if Chauvin had not committed that assault.\n\nAlternatively, the jury could convict Chauvin of third-degree murder . That charge accuses him of causing Floyd's death by \"perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\" Here, too, causation hinges on whether Floyd would have survived this encounter if Chauvin had acted differently.\n\nChauvin also faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter , which alleges that he caused Floyd's death \"by his culpable negligence, creating an unreasonable risk and consciously [taking] the chances of causing great bodily harm to another.\" Again, that requires showing that Chauvin's actions were the but-for cause of Floyd's death.\n\nThe second-degree murder charge also requires proving that Chauvin intentionally committed an assault, while the third-degree murder and manslaughter charges require proving either that his actions were \"eminently dangerous\" and reflected \"a depraved mind\" or that he \"consciously\" created \"an unreasonable risk\" of \"great bodily harm.\" In these analyses-especially the latter two-Chauvin's belief that Floyd was intoxicated does not help his case.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "This Program Aims to Correct the Culture of Acquiescence That Allowed Derek Chauvin to Kill George Floyd\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nJacob Sullum | 1.31.2022 4:50 PM\n\nThe federal trial of three former Minneapolis police officers who are charged with failing to stop Derek Chauvin from killing George Floyd resumed today. Much of the testimony presented by the prosecution has focused on the legal duty to prevent a fellow officer from using excessive force. The defense argues that the three officers, two of whom were rookies at the time of Floyd's arrest in May 2020, understandably deferred to Chauvin, the senior officer at the scene, as he pinned Floyd facedown to the pavement for nine and a half minutes.\n\nThe crucial question for the jury is whether J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao \"willfully\" deprived Floyd of his constitutional rights by failing to intervene and/or render medical aid. But the trial also raises the broader question of how police officers can be encouraged to stop their colleagues from violating people's rights, especially when the perpetrator outranks them and is presumed to know more about proper procedure. A training program that has taken off in the wake of Floyd's death aims to answer that question by providing officers with the practical skills they need to intervene in situations like this.\n\nChauvin, who was convicted of murder and manslaughter last April, is serving a 22-year sentence in state prison. He also has pleaded guilty to violating 18 USC 242 by depriving Floyd of his constitutional rights under color of law. Kueng, Lane, and Thao are charged with violating the same statute, but the issue is not so much what they did as what they failed to do.\n\nKueng and Lane, who had arrested Floyd for buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, helped Chauvin restrain Floyd as he repeatedly complained that he could not breathe and as bystanders repeatedly warned that his life was in danger. While Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, Kueng knelt on his back and Lane held his legs. Thao, who was tasked with handling the bystanders, alternately assured them that Floyd was fine and ordered them to step back when they tried to intervene.\n\nKueng and Thao are both charged with failing to stop Chauvin from continuing the prolonged prone restraint. Lane does not face that charge, presumably because he twice suggested that Floyd should be rolled from his stomach onto his side, consistent with what police are taught about the danger of \"positional asphyxia.\" But all three officers are charged with showing \"deliberate indifference to [Floyd's] serious medical needs.\"\n\nMinneapolis Police Department Inspector Katie Blackwell, who resumed her testimony today, has emphasized that the defendants should have known, based on their training, that Chauvin's use of force was excessive and that they had a duty to protect Floyd. The defense has argued that the training the officers received was inadequate to prepare them for what happened that day.\n\nWhile questioning Blackwell, Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, noted that department policy allowed officers to use their legs during a neck restraint, but \"police officers received absolutely zero training on how to use a leg as a mechanism for restraint.\" Blackwell agreed.\n\nPaule and Thomas Plunkett, Kueng's attorney, have also noted that the defendants were trained in the proper use of force but not in how to intervene when a colleague violates those rules. Blackwell conceded that officers are told they should never argue with a training officer.\n\nChauvin, a 19-year veteran, was Kueng's training officer. Kueng and Lane, who prior to Chauvin's arrival had tried unsuccessfully to force an agitated Floyd into the back seat of a squad car, were both new to the job. Kueng was working the third shift of his career. Thao had been a police officer for about 11 years.\n\nThe legal duty to intervene when another officer uses excessive force is well-established in the 8th Circuit, which includes Minnesota. In the 1981 case Putman v. Gerloff , for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit held that a deputy sheriff, James Crowe, could be held liable for failing to stop his supervisor, Sheriff Elmer Gerloff, from repeatedly striking a prisoner in the head with the butt of a shotgun. The prisoner had attempted to escape but was incapacitated at the point when the sheriff delivered those blows. \"Although Crowe was a subordinate,\" the court said, \"the evidence is sufficient to hold him jointly liable for failing to intervene if a fellow officer, albeit his superior, was using excessive force and otherwise was unlawfully punishing the prisoner.\"\n\nWhile conceding that Kueng and Thao were aware of this duty, their lawyers argue that their training left them ill-equipped to comply with it. Given Chauvin's seniority, they say, it was natural for the defendants to assume he knew what he was doing, and their failure to contradict him in these circumstances does not amount to a willful deprivation of Floyd's rights.\n\nWhether or not that argument sways the jury, the defendants have identified a real problem that police training frequently does not address. Granted that officers are supposed to do something in a situation like this, exactly what are they supposed to do, and how can they reasonably be expected to do it given the strong social and psychological pressures in favor of obedience and conformity?\n\nActive Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE), a training program that was established in 2021 and so far involves more than 200 police departments, aims to fill that gap. ABLE, which was developed by Georgetown University's Center for Innovations in Public Safety, grew out of a New Orleans program known as EPIC (Ethical Policing Is Courageous) that was launched in 2014 under the guidance of Ervin Staub, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. It is based on insights gained from research into why people either intervene or fail to intervene in emergency situations. The obstacles to intervention include deference to authority, diffusion of responsibility, and fear of retaliation and ostracism.\n\nJonathan Aronie, a partner at the law firm Sheppard Mullin, which sponsors ABLE, is chairman of the program's board of advisers. He says ABLE, which includes a week-long certification program for officers who conduct eight hours of training for their colleagues, is based on principles that have been proven effective for hospitals and airlines seeking to prevent surgical and pilot error. The challenge in those contexts is similar to the one exemplified by Floyd's death: overcoming the natural tendency to go along rather than risk negative consequences by challenging the judgment of colleagues and superiors.\n\nABLE, which demands explicit and conspicuous buy-in from police executives, local politicians, and community groups, strives to create a culture that reinforces the duty to intervene. The program, which is free to police departments thanks to support from Sheppard Mullin and several corporate donors, uses case studies and role-playing scenarios to identify and overcome the obstacles that prevented Kueng, Lane, and Thao from second-guessing Chauvin.\n\nDuring a recent ABLE webinar , New Orleans activist Ted Quant, who said he had spent 50 years \"protesting against police brutality,\" recalled an incident, prior to the creation of EPIC, when two officers who had undergone an earlier version of intervention training were punished because they forcibly stopped an officer who was beating a teenager. The difference, he said, was that at that point local police leadership did not support the changes that were necessary to address \"the certifiably brutal culture of the New Orleans Police Department.\"\n\nEPIC changed that culture, Quant said, and thereby equipped \"the lowest-ranking officer\" to \"intervene with the highest-ranking officer to prevent each of them from making mistakes or doing harm.\" He gave a real-life example of what that means in practice, describing an incident in which \"a young rookie police officer\" de-escalated an argument between her supervisor and women who were selling liquor shots on the street in an area of the French Quarter where that was not allowed.\n\n\"The senior officer was telling them that they can't sell the drinks,\" Quant said. \"The senior officer was being very professional and handling it, but the rookie could see that he was about to lose his temper and go off on these women, and there was going to be some mess.\"\n\nThe rookie's response was subtle but effective. \"The rookie touched his sleeve,\" Quant said, \"got his attention, and stepped in as if to say, 'I got this.' Now the senior officer gives a look like, 'Who do you think you are, telling me what to do?' And she pointed to her EPIC pin. When she pointed to her pin, and he sees this, he stepped back, and she took over. She de-escalated the situation and got compliance from the women, and as a result, there was no negative incident.\"\n\nWhile that situation began with a minor offense, so did the arrest that led to Floyd's death. It is impossible to say what would have happened if the New Orleans rookie had not stepped in, but there was clear potential for violent conflict between women who were angry about being hassled and an officer who was losing his patience.\n\n\"EPIC creates stories that are never told because nothing happened,\" Quant said. \"But something did happen: An incident was prevented. The rookie was really proud of what she did...She said, 'I EPICed him.' EPIC creates many untold stories.\"\n\nABLE aims to replicate those untold stories across the country. \"When George Floyd was murdered,\" ABLE co-founder Christy Lopez told the Georgetown student newspaper last year, \"one of the things that jumped out at many of us was not just Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck for so, so very many minutes. It was all the officers standing around who didn't really do anything at all. We're never going to prevent harm that could be prevented unless we focus on the bystanders who are in a position to intervene and make sure they actually intervene.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "A Pending Pardon for George Floyd Shows How the Drug War Gives Cops a License To Lie\n\nGeorge Floyd\n\nJacob Sullum | 10.6.2021 3:10 PM\n\nSixteen years before he died at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, George Floyd was arrested in Houston, his hometown, for delivery of a controlled substance. It was a routine case involving a tiny amount of crack, which the arresting officer said Floyd had given to a \"second suspect\" so that person could sell it to the cop, who was posing as a buyer. Floyd ultimately pleaded guilty and served 10 months in jail.\n\nFloyd's conviction was a sadly common illustration of the drug war's injustice and futility. No one would have given it a second look but for a 2019 raid in which Houston narcotics officers killed a middle-aged couple, Dennis Tuttle and Rhogena Nicholas, at their house on Harding Street. That operation, it turned out, was based on lies from start to finish , and the cop who instigated it, veteran narcotics officer Gerald Goines, was the same man who had arrested Floyd in 2004. This week the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that Gov. Greg Abbott grant Floyd a posthumous pardon for that crime in light of Goines' proven mendacity.\n\nThe pardon application , which Harris County public defender Allison Mathis submitted in April, is a window on how drug laws invite police not only to arrest people for peaceful conduct that violates no one's rights but also to invent that conduct from whole cloth. It's unclear how often that happens, because drug defendants who claim they were framed usually can't prove it, and their word counts for nothing against the testimony of police officers, who are presumed to be honest and dedicated public servants. Goines' history of arresting people on trumped-up charges shows the danger of that presumption.\n\nThe deadly Harding Street raid discovered no evidence that Tuttle or Nicholas was selling heroin, as Goines had claimed in his search warrant affidavit. A few weeks later, Goines admitted that he had invented a heroin purchase by a nonexistent confidential informant. That revelation led to state and federal charges against Goines, including tampering with government documents and felony murder. Last June, Steven Bryant, a narcotics officer who had backed up Goines' phony story, pleaded guilty to a federal charge of obstructing justice by falsifying records. The Harding Street raid also prompted the Harris County District Attorney's Office to reexamine thousands of cases involving Goines and his colleagues in the Houston Police Department's Narcotics Division.\n\nProsecutors identified more than 160 drug cases in which Goines was the sole witness or wrote a search warrant affidavit. They sent letters to the defendants, suggesting that they could challenge their convictions based on Goines' pattern of dishonesty. Two of those defendants, Otis Mallet and his brother Steven Mallet, were eventually declared \"actually innocent\" by a state appeals court.\n\nGoines' testimony was the only evidence against Otis and Steven Mallet. There were no other witnesses to the alleged transaction, and the can that he claimed contained the crack he supposedly bought had no usable fingerprints. Neighbors said they had not seen anything like the transaction Goines described. A drug-sniffing dog did not alert to the truck where Mallet allegedly had stashed the can of crack. During Otis Mallet's trial, the prosecution said that, given his many years of public service, Goines \"deserves to be treated with more respect than he's been treated with.\"\n\nOtis Mallet, who filed a federal lawsuit against Goines in August, had always maintained that Goines implicated him and his brother in a crack sale that never happened. The prosecutors who reexamined the 2008 case agreed , saying Goines \"repeatedly lied about nearly every aspect\" of the supposed transaction. Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said Goines' refusal to testify at Otis Mallet's innocence hearing was \"compelling evidence that the entire alleged narcotics transaction was a fraud.\"\n\nAlthough prosecutors tried to notify Floyd of his opportunity to reverse his conviction, they sent the letter to a Houston address after he had moved to Minneapolis, so he probably never received it. But the case against him, as described by Mathis in her pardon application, fits the pattern illustrated by the Harding Street raid and the arrests of Otis and Steven Mallet.\n\nGoines \"alleged that Floyd was in possession of .03 grams of crack cocaine at the time of his arrest, and that Floyd had provided the drugs to an unnamed 'second suspect' who had agreed to sell the drugs to the undercover Goines.\" That \"second suspect\" was not arrested, Goines said, \"in a [sic] attempt to further the narcotic trafficing [sic] in this area.\" Presumably he meant that he hoped this individual would be valuable as an informant. But for all we know, this person was just as imaginary as the informant who supposedly bought heroin from Tuttle.\n\nIn the Mallet case, Goines likewise said he had been assisted by an informant. That person, he claimed in a May 2008 expense report, \"provided information to officers that narcotics were being stored and sold from the location\" where Otis and Steven Mallet had been arrested the previous month. In return for his help, Goines said, \"the informant was paid two hundred dollars.\" The informant's involvement was conspicuously missing from Goines' description of the crack purchase in his arrest report and other case documents.\n\n\"It is our contention that Goines did the same thing in George Floyd's case as he did in the cases of so many others,\" Mathis writes. \"He made up the existence of a confidential informant who provided crucial evidence to underpin the arrest, and no one bothered to question the word of a veteran cop against that of a previously convicted Black man.\"\n\nIf so, why did Floyd plead guilty? One might ask the same question about Steven Mallet, who pleaded guilty to possession in exchange for a sentence of time served-10 months. He said he had rejected an earlier plea deal that would have required him to implicate his brother and decided to plead guilty only so he could get out of jail. Despite the guilty plea, the appeals court agreed that he was innocent.\n\nFloyd faced even more pressure to plead guilty. \"If Floyd had gone to trial,\" Mathis says, \"he would have faced punishment enhancements that would have branded him a habitual offender and could have sent him to prison for a minimum of twenty-five years. Like many people forced through the twisted criminal justice system in the United States, Floyd confessed to save his life. In exchange for his plea of guilty, those enhancements were not pursued. Floyd served his ten months in State Jail and was released.\"\n\nFloyd committed his most serious crime , aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, in 2007, three years after Goines arrested him for selling crack. He pleaded guilty in 2009 and received a five-year prison sentence. But by the time of his 2004 arrest, Floyd had been convicted of three felonies: delivering less than a gram of cocaine in 1997, theft in 1998, and possessing less than a gram of cocaine in 2002. Any two of these would have been enough to justify penalty enhancements under the Texas \"habitual offender\" statute if prosecutors had decided to pursue them.\n\nGiven Floyd's history at the time of his 2004 arrest, the crack charge was completely plausible on its face, which helps explain why it received no scrutiny until Goines' habitual dishonesty was revealed 15 years later. It may also explain why Goines had no compunction about framing Floyd, assuming that is what he did.\n\nIt is impossible to say for sure whether Goines was telling the truth in 2004. But Harris County prosecutors have reasonably concluded that Goines is demonstrably untrustworthy, which casts doubt on any conviction that hinged on his word. The drug war effectively gives cops like Goines a license to lie, since it justifies arrests and convictions in cases where the only witness is a cop and the only evidence is a transaction he claims to have seen, along with drugs that easily could have been obtained through other means.\n\nAs of 2019, when Goines retired* in the wake of the Harding Street raid, he had been employed by the Houston Police Department for 34 years, despite multiple allegations of testilying and sloppy evidence handling. \"If the magistrate who Goines asked to sign a warrant to permit the raid on Harding Street had known of his history of lies and deception,\" Ogg observed last year, \"he would not have signed it, and Rhogena and Dennis would likely still be alive today.\"\n\nThen-Police Chief Art Acevedo repeatedly described the cops who killed Tuttle and Nicholas as \"heroes,\" lavishing praise on Goines in particular. \"He's a big teddy bear,\" Acevedo said . \"He's a big African American, a strong ox, tough as nails, and the only thing bigger than his body, in terms of his stature, is his courage. I think God had to give him that big body to be able to contain his courage, because the man's got some tremendous courage.\"\n\nEven after Goines' lies were revealed, Acevedo, who is now Miami's police chief, denied that the Harding Street raid reflected \"systemic\" problems in the Narcotics Division. The charges that Ogg eventually brought against a dozen Houston narcotics officers, which included allegations of falsifying records and claiming phony overtime as well as a murder charge against another officer who participated in the raid, painted a different picture. \"Goines and others could never have preyed on our community the way they did without the participation of their supervisors,\" she said . \"Every check and balance in place to stop this type of behavior was circumvented.\"\n\nGiven the culture of lax or actively complicit supervision described in Ogg's charges and in federal lawsuits brought by the Tuttle and Nicholas families, it is easier to understand how Goines could get away with lying to implicate people in drug crimes for so long. The question is how many other cops like him are working for police departments across the country, treated as heroes as they systematically subvert justice.\n\n*CORRECTION: This post originally said Goines \"resigned.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .
