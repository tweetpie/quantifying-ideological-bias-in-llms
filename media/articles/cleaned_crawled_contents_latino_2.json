      "text": "Why so many Latino voters supported Donald Trump\n\nFor many observers of the 2024 US presidential election, Donald Trump's ability to harness so much of the Latino vote remains one of the more puzzling issues. Latino voters - men in particular - swung decisively towards Trump last November: increasing by 16 points from 2016 to 42% of the bloc in 2024.\n\nThis despite Trump's consistent history of antagonistic remarks about Latino immigrants. It also appears to fly in the face of the fact that his policies on tariffs, border militarisation and mass deportations will likely affect Mexico, Panama and several other Latin American countries.\n\nClearly, Latinos swung towards Trump for the same reason many other voters did. Many were unhappy with the economy (particularly inflation). There was also widespread anxiety about a marked increase in immigration at the southern border.\n\nBut there are more profound reasons driving the dramatic shift in the Latino vote. A closer look at some of the historical dynamics that have shaped the Latino electorate gives a clue for the reason behind this seeming paradox.\n\nThe Latino vote comprises about 14.7% of all eligible US voters. Yet it is far from a monolith . It is a heterogeneous group of people who trace their roots to Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the rest of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nEach of these countries has a different political landscape. They are made up of vastly different people with a different background and distinct cultures. And these differences shape disparate Latino identities in the United States. The term \"Latino\" itself is a blanket term. It can include extremely different populations: Afro-Dominicans in the Bronx, white Cubans in Miami, indigenous Mexicans in Los Angeles, mestizo Salvadorans in Washington DC and a vast array of others.\n\nEven within these national groups, there are also significant divisions. Partly, this is based on a person's time of arrival in the US. Mexican-Americans whose families immigrated to California from border cities like Chihuahua and Ciudad Juárez in the early 1940s as seasonal (and legal) agricultural workers will have different experiences and priorities than Mexicans who arrived more recently from the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca and settled in New York City without any legal pathway to citizenship. Meanwhile, Nicaraguan-American families who arrived in Miami in the 1980s fleeing the Sandinista revolution will have a different economic outlook from those escaping Daniel Ortega's current dictatorship.\n\nThere's no such thing as a generic \"Latino\" voter. The Latino population in the US needs to be understood as a heterogeneous one, made up of people with different experiences, priorities and preferences.\n\nFor many decades, Latinos were reliable Democratic voters - and many pundits predicted that they would stay that way, tipping the political scales decisively away from the Republican Party. But there has always been a strong strain of Latino conservatives voting Republican.\n\nReligion plays a key role here. The majority of people of Latino heritage are Catholic. But there is a growing population of Evangelicals and other Christian denominations, reflecting a growth of those groups in some Latin American countries .\n\nIn El Salvador, for example, the rise of Evangelical religions has produced an increasingly culturally conservative population, who support the \"mano dura\" (strong hand) policies of Nayib Bukele . A similar trend can be found among Latino communities in the US, where Latino Evangelicals strongly supported Trump in 2024 .\n\nThe political history of many Latin American countries is a clue to the make-up for migrants to the US. Mexico's Cristero War in the 1920s prompted thousands of Catholics to flee the country's anti-clerical government by migrating northwards. Three decades later, the Cuban revolution of 1959 produced large refugee flows of conservative and anticommunist migrants. These exiled groups - most notably, Cubans in South Florida - would ally with Republicans based on their punitive policies towards Cuba. This has helped turn Florida into a Republican stronghold .\n\nMore recently, 7 million Venezuelans fled the left-wing government of Nicolás Maduro. This has led to a more general antipathy among many Latino voters towards left-wing politics and politicians. Trump's condemnation of Maduro and Venezuela has endeared him to politically conservative Latino voters of all national backgrounds.\n\nInterestingly, it was also clear that some Latino voters are suspicious and resentful of newer waves of migrants, particularly recent asylum-seekers from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nThis dynamic between earlier arrivals and new immigrants is nothing new in the US. Earlier waves of immigrants and their descendants, such as Irish or Italian immigrants, also adopted nativist attitudes towards newer arrivals. In some ways, each generation of immigrants has tried to \"pull up the bridge\" to the generation that comes after them.\n\nYet these negative reactions also relate to racial and class hierarchies both within and between Latin American countries. Like the US, Latin American countries have a long history of racism and colour discrimination , as well as deep class divides and very high rates of income inequality .\n\nNew immigrants who have arrived in recent years from places such as Venezuela , Honduras , Cuba and Nicaragua are poorer than earlier generations of immigrants - and often have darker skin. As a result, cultural divides may impede a strong sense of solidarity between earlier generations of Latino immigrants and recent arrivals.\n\nThis is not to suggest that racism and classism are the dominant drivers behind Latino support for Trump. But it may help explain why Trump's campaign comments about recent Latino immigrants were not a dealbreaker for every Latino voter.\n\nUltimately, the Latino Trump supporter may not represent such a paradox after all. The so-called \"Latino voter\" is really a multiethnic , diverse bloc of people. While they share common linguistic and cultural features, Latinos are also motivated by a wide variety of religious, political and cultural factors that can be traced back to their own or their families' experiences in Latin America.\n\nThe Latino vote is complex. Politicians who want to win their support would do well to understand how these complicated identities inform their political decisions and allegiances. It appears at the moment the Republicans are doing this better than their Democratic rivals.\n\nJulia Young , Associate Professor, History, Catholic University of America and Gema Kloppe-Santamaría , Lecturer in Sociology, University College Cork\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "'Presumptuous and condescending': Latino journalist warns Dems against scolding Hispanics\n\nData from the 2024 election shows that President-elect Donald Trump made gains among all demographic groups, but significantly larger gains from Latino voters. One Latino journalist is now warning Democrats to not scapegoat Hispanic voters for their drubbing in the polls last week.\n\nIn a Tuesday essay for the San Antonio Express-News , columnist Ruben Navarrette Jr. argued that if Democrats hope to win back Latino voters, their current strategy of scolding and scapegoating Hispanics for defecting to the Republican side won't help. He noted that \"a precarious alliance of Black Democrats and white liberals\" is already alienating Latino voters by laying blame at their feet for Trump's second term.\n\n\"Latinos are now public enemy No. 1 with that group because of the outsized role we played in Trump's reelection. According to exit polls, Trump won support of 46% of Latinos and 55% of Latino men,\" Navarrette Jr. wrote. \"In [pundits'] minds, Latinos - especially the men - are sexist and racist. Simple as that.\"\n\nOne example of this scolding included an MSNBC segment feturing former Florida Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, who is white, and host Joy-Ann Reid, who is Black. Navarrette Jr. quoted Scarborough, who said that \"a lot of Hispanic voters have problems with Black candidates.\" He also opined that Reid was \"intoxicated by her superiority complex\" as she \"tore into Latino men for not voting how she wanted them to vote.\"\n\n\"Latino men, who, despite the utter disrespect shown by Trump and his promise to deport some of your mixed-status families, most of them voted in a 55% majority to make the deportations happen,\" Reid said. \"You all voted with Stephen Miller and David Duke... So, you own everything that happens to your mixed-status families and to your wives, sisters and abuelas from here on in.\"\n\nNavarrette Jr. clapped back, writing that Reid would do well to \"keep my abuela's name out of your mouth.\" He admonished liberals for their harshness toward Latino voters, reminding them that 25% of Black men voted for Trump, yet there haven't been cable news segments dedicated to lecturing them.\n\n\"Arrogant, presumptuous and condescending is not a good look - especially not for someone who is part of a marginalized group,\" he wrote. \"How do Black folks like it when white people scold them? They don't.\"\n\nThe columnist clarified that while he didn't personally vote for Trump, he also didn't vote for Vice President Kamala Harris , arguing that she ran a \"terrible campaign\" and \"only approached Latinos in the most insulting and superficial ways.\" He added that \"those who ran her campaign and the bigwigs who control the Democratic Party\" should be shouldered with the blame for Trump's victory rather than any specific bloc of voters, saying party bosses \"made plenty of mistakes and lost support with all kinds of Americans across the board.\"\n\n\"One of the biggest mistakes was falling totally out of step with Latinos. Those on the left don't have the faintest idea who we are, what we care about or how to speak to us,\" he continued. \"Worse, they're too arrogant to admit what they don't know. Their recent spate of attacks is just another example. Insults won't make the situation better. They will only make it worse.\""

      "text": "CNN panel derails as Latino Trump supporter defends mass deportations: 'No way around it'\n\nAlthough Vice President Kamala Harris received more Latino support than Donald Trump in the 2024 election, the number of Latinos who voted for Trump increased from what it was in 2016 and 2020 - especially among men.\n\nAccording to NBC News , 53 percent of the Latino vote went for Harris in 2024 compared to 45 percent for Trump. In 2020, however, President Joe Biden enjoyed 65 percent of the Latino vote.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta, in a segment on Thursday, November 7 , discussed the election's outcome among Latinos with New York Times journalist Lulu Garcia-Navarro; Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens; and Luis Figueroa, vice chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.\n\nThings became combative when Acosta asked Figueroa, a Trump supporter, if he supported Trump's threat of mass deportations.\n\nFigueroa told Acosta, \"There has to be deportations. There's no way around it.\"\n\nAcosta, noted, however, that during the infamous Operation Wetback program of the 1950s, Latinos who weren't in the country illegally got caught up in the deportation hysteria.\n\nDomingo Garcia told Acosta that Trump managed to convince Latino men that Harris didn't care about them.\n\n\"To a certain extent, I think Latino men felt excluded by the Democratic Party and by the Kamala Harris campaign. I don't think that's a fact, but I think that's the message that was out there. And that's why Trump was so successful in getting the Latino vote.\"\n\nLulu Garcia-Navarro stressed that economic issues were a high priority for Latinos in the election.\n\nThe New York Times reporter explained , \"It's a young population. Average voting age: 27. Second of all, low and medium income. So, they work in industries that were really impacted by inflation.\"\n\nAcosta pointed out that Trump's gains among Latinos came despite his threat of mass deportation.\n\nDomingo Garcia said , \"(Trump) used Latino immigrants as political piñatas', and he got a lot of political candy in this election.\"\n\nWatch the full video below or at this link ."

      "text": "Trump's Latino and Asian support increased despite anti-immigrant rhetoric - here's why\n\nAlthough Vice President Kamala Harris received more Latino votes than President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, Trump's Latino and Asian support increased from what it was in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThat support helped Trump enjoy a win that was far from a landslide, but was decisive - at least in the Electoral College. Trump, according to Cook Political Report's vote count , won a long list of key swing states and picked up 312 electoral votes compared to 226 for Harris.\n\nThe popular vote count was close. Trump, in 2024, won the popular vote for the first time. Cook's figures , as of Thursday, November 21, show Trump defeating Harris by roughly 1.5 percent in the popular vote.\n\nHarris, during the presidential race, was vehemently critical of Trump's threat of mass deportations and false, racist claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were kidnapping and eating residents' pets.\n\nJournalist Gloria Oladipo, in an article published by The Guardian on November 21, details some reasons why Trump's support among Latinos and Asians increased in 2024 despite his anti-immigrant rhetoric and threats of mass deportations.\n\n\"A record 46 percent of Latinos voted for Trump - a 14-point increase from 2020, according to Edison Research exit polls,\" Oladipo explains . \"Asian-American support for Trump increased by five points, rising to 39 percent this year from 34 percent in 2020. Black voter support for Trump sat at 13 percent in 2024, relatively unchanged from 12 percent in 2020. And though it's true that the majority of people of color voted for Harris across the board, experts have warned that assuming these groups would automatically reject a racist candidate such as Trump ignores important nuance, particularly with regard to concerns about the economy.\"\n\nAccording to journalist Paula Ramos , Latinos in the U.S. aren't necessarily immune to \"anti-immigration\" messaging - especially when it's combined with an economic message.\n\nRamos told The Guardian , \"That racial baggage is one that we've carried in this country and through American politics for a long time. And I think (that) has now been finally revealed in very clear ways through Trumpism.... In every single message: '(Immigrants) are taking your jobs. They are coming after you'.... Inevitably, particularly if you're part of certain ecosystems, you'll start believing that rhetoric.\"\n\nJournalist Dash Harris, similarly, told The Guardian , \"We cannot act as if the Dominican Republic isn't deporting thousands of Haitians right now. If Latin Americans are migrating from fascist countries, they are going to support fascism in their new space. It's a continuum of interest convergence.\"\n\nRead The Guardian's full article at this link ."

      "text": "Immigrants' resentment over new arrivals helped boost Trump's popularity with Latino voters\n\nMigrants who requested an appointment for asylum in the United States using the CBP One application, a mobile phone app promoted by the U.S. administration that provides a way to lawfully approach the port of entry, stand in line to have their papers checked before crossing into the U.S., in Tijuana, Mexico November 4, 2024. REUTERS/Jorge Duenes\n\nAt first, she didn't think much about the Nicaraguan asylum-seekers who began moving into town a few years ago. Rosa was an immigrant too, one of the many undocumented Mexican immigrants who'd settled nearly 30 years ago in Whitewater, a small university town in southeast Wisconsin.\n\nSome of the Nicaraguans had found housing in Rosa's neighborhood, a trailer park at the edge of town. They sent their children to the same public schools. And they got jobs in the same factories and food-processing facilities that employed many of Rosa's friends and relatives.\n\nThen Rosa realized that many of the newcomers with ongoing asylum cases could apply for work permits and driver's licenses - state and federal privileges that are unavailable to undocumented immigrants. Rosa's feelings of indifference turned to frustration and resentment.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" said Rosa, who works as a janitor. \"Those of us who have been here for years get nothing.\"\n\nHer anger is largely directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for failing to produce meaningful reforms to the immigration system that could benefit people like her. In our reporting on the new effects of immigration , ProPublica interviewed dozens of long-established Latino immigrants and their U.S.-born relatives in cities like Denver and Chicago and in small towns along the Texas border. Over and over, they spoke of feeling resentment as they watched the government ease the transition of large numbers of asylum-seekers into the U.S. by giving them access to work permits and IDs, and in some cities spending millions of dollars to provide them with food and shelter.\n\nIt's one of the reasons so many Latino voters chose Donald Trump this election, giving him what appears to be Republicans' biggest win in a presidential race since exit polls began tracking this data. Latinos' increased support for Trump - who says he could use the military to execute his plans for mass deportations - defied conventional wisdom, disrupting long-held assumptions about loyalties to the Democratic Party. The shift could give Republicans reason to cater to Latinos to keep them in the party's fold.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump singled out Whitewater after the police chief wrote a letter to Biden asking for help responding to the needs of the new Nicaraguan arrivals. While some residents were put off by Trump's rhetoric about the city being destroyed by immigrants, it resonated with many of the longtime Mexican-immigrant residents we interviewed. They said they think the newcomers have unfairly received benefits that they never got when they arrived illegally decades ago - and that many still don't have today.\n\nAmong those residents is one of Rosa's friends and neighbors who asked to be identified by one of her surnames, Valadez, because she is undocumented and fears deportation. A single mother who cleans houses and buildings for a living, Valadez makes extra money on the side by driving immigrants who don't have cars to and from work and to run errands. It's a risky side hustle, though, because she's frequently been pulled over and ticketed by police for driving without a license, costing her thousands of dollars in fines.\n\nOne day two summers ago, one of her sons found a small purse at a carnival in town. Inside they found a Wisconsin driver's license, a work permit issued to a Nicaraguan woman and $300 in cash. Seeing the contents filled Valadez with bitterness. She asked her son to turn in the purse to the police but kept the $300. \"I have been here for 21 years,\" she said. \"I have five children who are U.S. citizens. And I can't get a work permit or a driver's license.\"\n\nWhen she told that story to Rosa one afternoon this spring, her friend nodded emphatically in approval. Rosa, like Valadez, couldn't vote. But two of Rosa's U.S.-born children could, and they cast ballots for Trump. One of Rosa's sons even drives a car with a bumper sticker that says \"Let's Go Brandon\" - a popular anti-Biden slogan.\n\nRosa said she is glad her children voted for Trump. She's not too worried about deportation, although she asked to be identified solely by her first name to reduce the risk. She believes Trump wants to deport criminals, not people like her who crossed the border undetected in the 1990s but haven't gotten in trouble with the law. \"They know who has been behaving well and who hasn't been,\" she said.\n\nIn the months leading up to the presidential election, numerous polls picked up on the kinds of frustrations felt by Rosa and her family. Those polls indicated that many voters considered immigration one of the most pressing challenges facing the country and that they were disappointed in the Biden administration's record.\n\nBiden had come into office in 2021 promising a more humane approach to immigration after four years of more restrictive policies during the first Trump administration. But record numbers of immigrants who were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border began to overwhelm the system. While the Biden administration avoided talking about the border situation like a crisis, the way Trump and the GOP had, outspoken critics like Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amplified the message that things at the border were out of control while he arranged to bus thousands of immigrants to Democrat-controlled big cities around the country. In Whitewater, hundreds of Nicaraguans arrived on their own to fill jobs in local factories, and many of them drove to work without licenses, putting a strain on the small local police department with only one Spanish-speaking officer.\n\nWhile the Biden administration kept a Trump expulsion policy in place for three years, it also created temporary parole programs and an app to allow asylum-seekers to make appointments to cross the border. The result was that hundreds of thousands more immigrants were allowed to come into the country and apply for work permits, but the efforts didn't assuage the administration's critics on the right or left. Meanwhile, moves to benefit undocumented workers who were already in the country were less publicized, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nConchita Cruz, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, which serves a network of around 1 million asylum-seekers across the country, said that because of either court challenges or processing backlogs, Biden wasn't able to deliver on many of his promises to make it easier for immigrants who've lived in this country for years to regularize their status.\n\n\"Policies meant to help immigrants have not always materialized,\" she said.\n\nCruz said that while the administration extended the duration of work permits for some employment categories, backlogs have hampered the quick processing of those extensions. As of September, there were about 1.2 million pending work permit applications, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, with many pending for six months or more. USCIS said the agency has taken steps to reduce backlogs while processing a record number of applications.\n\nBiden's attempts to push for broad immigration reform in Congress, including a proposal his administration sent on his first day in office, went nowhere. Earlier this year, in an effort to prevent a political win for Biden before the election, Trump pressured Republicans to kill bipartisan legislation that would have increased border security.\n\nCamila Chávez, the executive director of the Dolores Huerta Foundation in Bakersfield, California, said Democrats failed to combat misinformation and turn out Latino voters. She recalled meeting one young Latina Trump supporter while she knocked on voters' doors with the foundation's sister political action organization. The woman told her she was concerned that the new immigrant arrivals were bringing crime and cartel activity - and potentially were a threat to her own family's safety.\n\n\"That's our charge as organizations, to make sure that we are in the community and educating folks on how government works and to not vote against our own self-interests. Which is what's happening now,\" said Chávez, who is the daughter of famed farmworker advocate Dolores Huerta and a niece of Cesar Chávez.\n\nTrump has made clear he intends to deliver on his deportation promises, though the details of how he'll do it and who will be most affected remain unclear. The last time Trump was elected, he moved quickly to issue an executive order that said no \" classes or categories \" of people who were in the country illegally could be exempt from enforcement. Tom Homan, who Trump has picked to serve as his \"border czar,\" said during a recent interview with Fox & Friends that immigrants who were deemed to be a threat to public safety or national security would be a priority under a new administration. But he said immigrants with outstanding deportation orders will also be possible targets and that there will be raids at workplaces with large numbers of undocumented workers.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican strategist, said it's wishful thinking to believe Trump will give any special treatment to undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. for a long time. But he's heard that sentiment among Latino voters in focus groups.\n\n\"They believe that they are playing by the rules and that they will be rewarded for it,\" Madrid said. \"Republicans have never been serious about legal migration, let alone illegal migration. They're allowing themselves to believe that for no good reason.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's growing appeal to Latino voters was especially noticeable in places like Del Rio, a Texas border town. As ProPublica previously reported, Trump flipped the county where Del Rio sits from blue to red in 2020 and won it this year with 63% of the vote .\n\nSergio Garza Castillo, a Mexican immigrant who owns a gas station and convenience store in Del Rio, illustrates that political shift. Garza Castillo said he came to the U.S. legally as a teenager in the 1980s after his father, a U.S. citizen, petitioned and waited for more than a decade to bring his family across the border.\n\nEver since Garza Castillo became a U.S. citizen in 2000, he has tended to vote for Democrats, believing in their promise of immigration reform that could lead to more pathways to citizenship for long-established undocumented immigrants, including many of his friends and acquaintances.\n\nBut the Democrats \"promised and they never delivered,\" Garza Castillo said. \"They didn't normalize the status of the people who were already here, but instead they let in many migrants who didn't come in the correct way.\" He believes asylum-seekers should have to wait outside the country like he did.\n\nHe said he began to turn away from the Democrats in September 2021, when nearly 20,000 mostly Haitian immigrants seeking asylum waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico and camped out under the city's international bridge near Garza Castillo's gas station. Federal authorities had instructed the immigrants to wait there to be processed; some remained there for weeks, sleeping under tarps and blankets with little access to water and food. Garza Castillo said he and other business owners lost money when the federal government shut down the international bridge, an economic engine for Del Rio.\n\nSome of the Haitian migrants were eventually deported; others were allowed into the U.S. to pursue asylum claims and given notices to appear in court in a backlogged immigration system that can take years to resolve a case. \"That to me is offensive for those who have been living here for more than 10 years and haven't been able to adjust their status,\" Garza Castillo said.\n\nHe hopes Trump seizes on the opportunity to expand support from Latino voters by creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who've been here for years. \"If he does that,\" he said, \"I think the Republican Party will be strong here for a long time.\"\n\nAnjeanette Damon , Nicole Foy , Perla Trevizo and Gerardo del Valle contributed reporting."

      "text": "Red scare at the Smithsonian? Battle brews over portrayal of Latino history in planned new museum\n\nA political battle is brewing in Washington, D.C., over plans to build a National Museum of the American Latino and the portrayal of American Latino history. Last year, the Smithsonian Institution opened a temporary preview exhibition inside the National Museum of American History that has become the focus of controversy within the Latino community, as Republican lawmakers and others challenge what one conservative writer described in The Hill as an \"unabashedly Marxist portrayal of history.\" We speak to two historians who were hired to develop a now-shelved exhibit on the Latino civil rights movement of the 1960s for the museum. Felipe Hinojosa is a history professor at Baylor University in Texas, and Johanna Fernández is an associate professor of history at the City University of New York's Baruch College. We discuss their vision for the first national museum dedicated to Latino history, which Hinojosa describes as \"complex\" and \"nuanced,\" and how conservative backlash has sought to stymie and rewrite their work. \"These conservatives are using fear to essentially push through their agenda,\" says Fernández, who warns that the rising wave of censorship throughout the U.S. could be a \"repeat of the Red Scare.\"\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe turn now to look at a brewing controversy at the Smithsonian Institution over plans to build a National Museum of the American Latino. In 2020, Congress passed funding to create the museum, along with an American Women's History Museum, but there's been a deep divide in Washington over how Latinos should be portrayed in the museum. Last year, the museum opened a temporary exhibit inside the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The exhibition is called \"¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States.\" Republican lawmakers and other conservatives within the Latino community have attacked the exhibition, leading the Smithsonian to halt plans for a future exhibition on the Latino civil rights movement of the 1960s. In its place, the Smithsonian is now planning an exhibition on salsa and Latin music. This fight is exploding into public view in the midst of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15th to October 15th.\n\nThis is Jorge Zamanillo, the founding director of the National Museum of the American Latino, giving a brief tour of the current exhibit in a video posted by the Smithsonian.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Jorge Zamanillo, the founding director of the National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nOne vocal critic of the museum's exhibition has been the Cuban-born Congressmember Mario Díaz-Balart, who threatened in July to block funding for the museum - he serves on the House Committee on Appropriations - and later backed down on his threat after he met with Jorge Zamanillo and Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the overall Smithsonian Institution. After the meeting, the museum changed parts of the exhibit featuring a foam raft used by Cuban refugees to flee the country. The original exhibition text said the refugees were, quote, \"escaping Cuba's economic crisis.\" In July, the text was changed to add a reference to Fidel Castro and, quote, \"Cuba's dictatorship, political repression, and economic crisis,\" unquote. Some of the first public criticism of the current exhibition came from a group of conservative writers who penned a column in The Hill last year claiming the exhibit offered a, quote, \"unabashedly Marxist portrayal of history,\" unquote.\n\nThe controversy comes as the Smithsonian is seeking to raise enough money to build the museum, which will cost an estimated $800 million. The New York Times reports $58 million has been raised so far.\n\nWe're joined now by two historians who have been hired to develop the now-shelved exhibit on the Latino civil rights movement of the '60s for the museum. Felipe Hinojosa is a history professor at Baylor University in Texas. He's also the author of the book Apostles of Change: Latino Radical Politics, Church Occupations, and the Fight to Save the Barrio . Johanna Fernández is an associate professor of history at the City University of New York's Baruch College. She's also the author of The Young Lords: A Radical History of the United States.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Johanna Fernández, let's begin with you. What has happened? I mean, the idea that this museum was going to be built either across the Mall from the Museum of African American History or in the Tidal Basin, but this, your \"¡Presente!\" exhibit, has led to this kind of uprising on the right. Can you explain what the current exhibit is, what the one that has been shelved is, at least for now, that you and Professor Hinojosa have been the creators of?\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: \"¡Presente!\" - well, thank you for covering this evolving crisis. \"¡Presente!\" is the current exhibition at the Molina Family Gallery within the American History Museum at the Smithsonian. It's an exhibition in waiting while the actual building of the Latino History Museum goes up in 10 to 12 years.\n\nWhat is important about \"¡Presente!\" is that it really outlines the contours of Latino history, which are complicated. One of the points it makes is that the largest Latino population in the United States was integrated after the United States war with Mexico in 1848, which is responsible for giving the United States its contemporary boundaries. Half of the United States was acquired during that war, and the people who were in those Mexican lands remained in the now borders of the United States. And the integration of those people into a hostile America is part of American history. The \"¡Presente!\" exhibition also highlights the acquisition by the United States of Puerto Rico in 1898 and also discusses the ways in which U.S. foreign policy and economic policy has driven people out of Latin America and into the United States. So, what's important is that it establishes the question: Who are Latinos? How did they get here? And what's their relationship to their communities and to the nation and the world?\n\nUnfortunately, conservative Latinos don't want to hear that narrative. They want a narrative that emphasizes Latino military service and business success among Latinos in the United States.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Felipe Hinojosa, you come from - you work and come from Texas, a state at the forefront of some of the culture wars that we're experiencing today. Could you talk about how you learned of the concern here, and what you were told by folks at the Smithsonian about what needed to change or didn't need to change in terms of the work you were doing?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA: Well, thank you, first off, for having me.\n\nYes, I am from Texas. I'm from the Rio Grande Valley, born and raised in Brownsville, Texas. That has shaped a big part of who I am. It shapes a big part of the work that I do.\n\nWriting about and teaching on the Latino civil rights movement has been a centerpiece of the work that I do and that I've collaborated with other historians in doing. And I think in joining with this work with the Smithsonian, I think, for me, the biggest joy and the biggest thrill was to be able to present these questions that Johanna has just mentioned. The larger and broader questions of who are we and who are we as a community and what is our relationship to the nation were central questions for Latino civil rights activists in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWe worked on this exhibit, on the \"Latino Youth Movements\" exhibit, with the Smithsonian for two years. We were 65% complete. And the sort of rumblings that started to happen came immediately after the piece that was published in The Hill . I believe it was summer of 2022 when that came out. And there was some concern in terms of the kind of material that we would be presenting. But I think, for us, our major concern was to just make sure that we were telling a truthful story, a complex story and a nuanced story about how Latinos have grappled with their relationship to the United States.\n\nThe critiques that came to us and what we were told in terms of what could be and could not be included, I think, were alarming to us. And when the email came in November of 2022 that this exhibit was going to be paused or canceled, I think it confirmed our fears of the fact that the Smithsonian was not viewing the Latino civil rights movement as a broad enough story, as a story that would raise the kind of funds that this museum needs to open in 10 or 12 years. And I think, from the work, certainly, that we have done and the work that we were engaged in for two years, nothing could be further than the truth. What's bigger and what's more, I think, central than young people asking themselves and their communities how they can make this a nation that is better for all?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Johanna Fernández, this whole issue of political leaders putting pressure on a museum to basically override the historians that the museum has chosen to develop its exhibitions?\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: Well, I think we have to look at this conflict in the broader history of the last 10 years, when conservatives have launched a calculated and broad-sweeping campaign to essentially eliminate the teaching of Black American history, Latino history, ethnic studies, women's history and LGBTQ+ history in the schools. And now what we see is that through this witch hunt and by smearing historians and curators as Marxists, these conservatives are using fear to essentially push through their agenda. And now, again, this has reached a federal museum, and not just any federal museum, but the largest network of museums in the world, which is known as the Smithsonian. In many ways, this sounds and looks like a repeat of the Red Scare or previous moments of repression in the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, Professor Fernández, what is your response to them sending you this email saying they're putting your next exhibition on pause? To be clear, \"¡Presente!\" is now in that temporary National American History Museum space, and the one you're doing on the civil rights movement is the one that is paused, saying that they want to appeal to a larger audience, especially because they're fundraising, and so they'll shelve the civil rights issue and do instead an exhibition on salsa music and Latin music.\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: I think we have to say that there is no more integral matter in the United States than the struggle for freedom, democracy and to redefine the United States as a country for all. That's integral and core to the American imagination. So, to say that this issue is a minor one is really to not understand the very essence of American history, upon which the American Revolution and its determination to fight for liberty and the pursuit of happiness is core.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Hinojosa, I wanted to ask you, in terms of the - in Texas itself, there clearly is a very significant and strong conservative population in the Latino community. So, not only is this a national ethnic struggle, there's also a class component to how people view history. What's your sense of why it is so important to tell the story as you have researched it and looked into it throughout your career versus what some of the political leaders of your state might want?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA: Well, first of all, I would say a lot of political leaders are often disconnected from the grassroots community. They don't understand what the community is asking for. I've been in the classroom for over 20 years. Students are wanting more of this history, wanting to better understand how Latinos have shaped Texas politics, have shaped the history of the United States - and not just Latino students, by the way. I'm talking to students of all backgrounds that are very invested in telling a bigger story of American history and having a broader understanding of it.\n\nThe other thing is demographic change, the demographics of the state of Texas. Texas is now a Latino-majority state. And so, to have those demographic changes that have taken place in the last 20 years across the state, I think, signaled to us a tremendous responsibility to teach this history, to have a better understanding of the contributions of this community. We are not perpetual foreigners. We are not people that are new to this nation. We have contributed for generations to make this country what it is today, and in particular in my home state of Texas.\n\nAnd the idea is not to simply talk about a liberal-versus-conservative idea of history. The idea here is to tell a story that is complex, that is nuanced and that gets at this idea of democracy, that gets at how different people from different sections of society have made this country what it is today, and I think in particular the state of Texas. I mean, there's a reason why Texas history classes fill up the way that they do at universities across my home state of Texas. People love this history. They respect it. They admire it, as they should. But we need a bigger telling of it. We need a bigger story, a story that brings in marginalized voices, voices that have been silenced throughout history. And I think our exhibit was one small step to try to do that, not only at the state level, but at the national level.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you give, perhaps, some examples of [inaudible] that you wanted to put forth in the civil rights exhibit, especially in terms of Texas, a history that many Americans perhaps may not be aware of, whether it's the Crystal City uprising in the early '60s or other aspects of Texas Latino history?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA: Yeah. In particular, we were looking at the ways in which Latinos in the state of Texas and across the Southwest and across the country have not waited for the nation to do something for us. We're not sitting idly by. Historically, what we've done is we've taken matters into our own hands for political participation.\n\nYou mentioned Crystal City, in 1963 gaining ground to the Crystal City's City Council. There was a group of five Mexican Americans that won those City Council seats. That was a huge, huge shift and, I think, a call to the state of Texas that Mexican Americans were serious about political participation. They went on to form La Raza Unida Party. They ran a candidate for a governor here in the state of Texas. And that's the kind of history that we want to tell, one of agency, one of power, one that gets at how Latinos have not simply waited on but have acted upon to make this country more democratic and more representative for all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Professor Hinojosa, we want to thank you for being with us, of Baylor University in Texas, and Johanna Fernández, professor of history at the City University of New York: Baruch College. And, Juan, thank you so much for your book, Harvest of Empire: Stories of Latinos in America . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González."

      "text": "Here's the truth about the Latino electorate - and a wake-up call for Democrats\n\nA narrative is growing around the idea that President Joe Biden (and, therefore, the Democratic Party) lost significant ground among Latino voters, especially in South Florida. That story, however, does not fully explain movements in the electorate. When you look at the data, there are some misconstructions that demand clarification.\n\nFirst, it bears repeating that Latinos are not monolithic. The degree to which they are cross-cut by national origin, political ideology, generations, gender, education, religion and race requires a complex approach to decode this key voter constituency.\n\nBiden's performance in Miami-Dade County among Latino voters has been called an earthquake. While it was poorer than expected, it wasn't that bad. Alarm bells that went off before Election Day were based on early voting and ballot returns.\n\nMoreover, according to Biden's campaign manager, this final result was not so much a deficit of Latino votes as it was an increase in support for Donald Trump among Cuban Americans, with a turnout of 55 percent . Despite that, the Republican incumbent still fell short of winning the majority of the Latino vote , nationally.\n\nFurthermore, other data suggests that losses among Latinos did not determine the outcome of the election. According to Matt Barreto and Kevin Munoz , there was a shift among the electorate, where Trump made gains beyond the Latino/Hispanic electorate in Miami-Dade. Still, there is little mention of the fact that Democrats experienced a net increase in votes due to Puerto Rican turnout in Central Florida.\n\nThe question remains: why did voters who were opposed to Trump's immigration policies offer such strong support. The answer is that Cuban Americans (along with the less quantitatively significant Venezuelan Americans) were persuaded by Trump's fake war against \"socialism,\" with the help by a powerful media outreach, both in English and Spanish-speaking broadcasting, that targeted Cuban- and Venezuelan-American voters. The fear-mongering was a critical part of the Trump campaign.\n\nIt goes without saying the Trump campaign crafted a message based on lies about nonexistent socialism. At the same time, however, this situation underscores the contradictions of the complex Cuban-American electorate, which has in the past supported raising taxes on the rich, low-cost education, the Affordable Care Act, other policies considered to be more left-leaning. So ... why did they vote for Trump?\n\nThere are two important factors to consider at this point: religion and race.\n\nThe predominantly Catholic Latino vote has been historically associated with the Democratic Party though it has seen a drop in the last decade . Among Republicans, there has been steady support from Catholics and Protestants, though with more recent signs of a stagnation from the Latino-Protestant cluster, leading to the interpretation of secularization among the Hispanic/Latino population.\n\nThis somewhat explains the appeal of Donald Trump among Latinos , Catholics and, especially, Evangelicals, but it is also falsely rooted in presenting Trump as an anti-abortion hero against Biden, who is not only a practicing Catholic, but is personally opposed to abortion while being pro-choice and pro-reproductive rights.\n\nFinally, the racial debate among Latino/Hispanics can get contentious, especially when one has been culturally trained to ignore it. This certainly applies to foreign-born Latino/Hispanics who adapted to continuous s inquiries about their race. Some indicators suggest that the framing of Latino/Hispanics as not being American causes negative reactions among those who have been in the United States for generations, with evidence of a decline in their identification as Latino/Hispanic. In those cases, they still check \"Hispanic\" on government forms, but they identify as white .\n\nThis is a critical aspect of the conversation that is often swept under the rug. The Latino/Hispanic racial debate is basically nonexistent , because we are culturally detached from it. It does not mean that there are no racial tensions, but they are rather treated as social disparities. The challenge presented by a system that is constantly reminding people they are different from the cultural majority, and that they belong to a minority, pushes many of those who feel outcast to join the majority .\n\nThere will certainly come a time when Latinos reckon with intra-racism. The fact that assimilation implies dealing with identity has an impact on electoral behavior, and with many Hispanics identifying mostly as white , this is a wake-up call for the Democrats. They need to understand these nuances to properly address them, and most important of all, prevent electoral manipulation of their constituents."

      "text": "'Fox News in Spanish': The new right-wing media outlet courting Latino voters\n\nWhen Donald Trump was competing with Jeb Bush in the 2016 GOP presidential primary, Trump chastised the former Florida governor for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail. Trump argued that Bush, a fluent Spanish speaker, was encouraging Latino immigrants to avoid learning English.\n\nBut when Trump ran for reelection in 2020, outreach to Spanish-language media was a fundamental part of his game plan - especially in Florida. To a degree, it worked. While Trump lost the 2020 election, Florida was one of the states in which his victory was only possible thanks to conservative Latino voters.\n\nWhen one of Trump's former White House press secretaries, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was sworn in as Arkansas governor in early January, she banned the use of the term \"Latinx\" in government communications and criticized the term for being grammatically awkward in Spanish. Many Spanish speakers find that term offensive (including Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona), and Sanders' executive order seemed to be an attempt at Latino outreach.\n\nEnglish-only initiatives have been common among MAGA Republicans. But a new right-wing media outlet, Americano Media , is using Spanish to enamor Latino voters.\n\nReporting for Politico on January 23, journalist Natalie Allison explains that \"Republicans have made notable inroads among Hispanic voters in recent election cycles. Now, a conservative media network is looking to cement and further those gains by trying to become the Fox News of Spanish-speaking America. Americano Media, which launched in March, is embarking on an aggressive expansion plan to shape center-right Hispanic opinion during the upcoming election cycle.\"\n\nAccording to Allison, Americano Media \"has hired more than 80 Latino journalists and producers, are expanding their radio presence to television, and by the end of the year, will have studios in Miami, Las Vegas and D.C. with reporters covering the White House, Congress and embedding in 2024 presidential campaigns.\"\n\n\"This month, Americano is launching a $20 million marketing campaign to draw in new viewers,\" Allison reports. \"It's the latest development in an arms race to reach and win over the nation's second-largest demographic group, one playing an increasingly critical role in election outcomes.\"\n\nThis is a big departure from 2015, when Trump, interviewed by Breitbart News, said of Jeb Bush, \"I like Jeb. He's a nice man. But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.\"\n\nIvan Garcia-Hidalgo, Americano's founder and CEO, told Politico that Americano's goal is to be a \"Fox News in Spanish.\" And some Democrats are taking notice.\n\nTara McGowan, founder and publisher of the Democrat-friendly Courier Newsroom network, told Politico, \"There is an information war in Latino and bilingual communities in this country. It's a very smart and very alarming move by conservatives to double down on their investment in Americano Media.\""

I think it's called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe backlash came swiftly, with many Puerto Ricans - from the island itself to the Continental United States - calling out Hinchcliffe's racist comments. Three major Puerto Rican celebrities (Jennifer López, Ricky Martin and reggaetón star Bad Bunny) responded by endorsing Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nMembers of Trump's campaign have been in damage-control mode. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt described Hinchcliffe's joke as being \"in poor taste,\" and her colleague Danielle Alvarez stated, \"This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump.\"\n\nBut Trump himself, according to Daily Beast reporters Mini Racker and Mary Ann Ackers , appears to be in denial about the scandal.\n\nRacker and Ackers report , \"Donald Trump insists his Latino-trashing rally in New York - which sparked widespread outrage, even among Republicans - went 'great' and was 'filled up'.... At another campaign event in Atlanta, seemingly oblivious that he may have alienated a crucial voting bloc to his electoral success, Trump bragged about the crowd size at his Sunday rally at the Garden.\"\n\nTrump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) has responded to the controversy by saying he wished Americans didn't \"get so offended at every little thing.\"\n\n\"But outside the Trump-Vance bubble,\" Racker and Ackers observe , \"the furor sparked by Trump's Sunday rally at the Garden 'spread like wildfire' in Pennsylvania - the crucial swing state that is home to roughly 600,000 Latino voters, the vast majority of whom are Puerto Rican.... The MSG controversy comes one week before Election Day in a razor-thin race that could break either way. And Democrats are seizing on the Madison Square Garden controversy to shore up support from Latino Americans - a crucial voting bloc in all seven battleground states where the election will be decided.\"\n\nRead the Daily Beast's full article at this link (subscription required)."

A New York Times headline described it as \" Trump's racist rally .\"\n\nThe most-noted racist remarks came from a comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, in an attack calling Puerto Rico a \" floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean ,\" and saying , \"these Latinos, they love making babies, too, just know that. They do, they do. There's no pulling out. They don't do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country,\" before talking about Black people carving watermelons .\n\nThe Trump campaign waited several hours before issuing a statement saying , \"This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.\" It was unclear why other racist remarks made throughout the event, including by Hinchcliffe, were not addressed by the campaign.\n\n\"Battleground Pennsylvania,\" NBC News reports, \"where polling margins show a razor-thin race between Trump and Harris , is home to the third-largest Puerto Rican diaspora in the country . Last month, the former president invited Puerto Rican artist Anuel AA onstage at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to publicly throw his support behind the Republican ticket.\"\n\nVariety reports, \"Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin were among the notable industry figures who boosted Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Sunday after a speaker at Donald Trump 's political rally at New York's Madison Square Garden called Puerto Rico 'a floating island of garbage.'\"\n\n\"Bad Bunny, one of the world's biggest music superstar[s] with more than 45 million Instagram followers, boosted Harris' campaign video targeting voters in Puerto Rico and noting what a contentious relationship that Trump had with the island during his tenure in the White House. Lopez posted Harris campaign material targeted at Puerto Rico as well as the same video pitch that Bad Bunny boosted.\"\n\n\"Singer-actor Ricky Martin, with 18.6 million Instagram followers, did the same thing on his Instagram Stories feed, adding the comment 'I remember' on the Harris video. He also included a clip of Hinchcliffe's 'garbage' comment.\"\n\nVariety continued, reporting, \"Luis Fonsi, the Puerto Rican singer who had a worldwide smash in 2017 with 'Despacito,' also reposted the Harris video and added a comment.\"\n\n\"We are not OK with this constant hate.

The League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ), the country's oldest Latino civil rights group, is calling on the Justice Department to investigate Paxton over a series of police raids on the homes of LULAC members, state lawmakers and other community leaders in the San Antonio area last week. Previously, Paxton had tried and failed to shut down the Houston-based and immigrant-led civil rights group Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en la Lucha ( FIEL ) by claiming it engaged in electioneering. We're joined by the director of FIEL , Cesar Espinosa, and the CEO of LULAC , Juan Proaño, who both share how their organizations have been impacted by the attorney general's harassment and intimidation. Proaño calls the targeting of Latino leaders and organizations a pattern of \"blatant discrimination\" and says, \"We see these as tactics essentially for Republicans to stay in control of the government in Texas.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe turn now to Texas, where the Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton is raising concerns about voter suppression by targeting the country's oldest Latino civil rights group, LULAC , the League of United Latin American Citizens. LULAC was first founded to fight discrimination against citizens of Mexican descent in Texas. Now it's responding to a series of raids of the homes of LULAC members, state lawmakers and other Latino leaders in the San Antonio area last week.\n\nSpeaking to the media Monday, longtime LULAC volunteer, 87-year-old Lidia Martinez described how armed officers arrived at her home at 6 a.m. with a warrant to seize electronic devices, swab for DNA , as they collected evidence of alleged vote harvesting and identity fraud.\n\nLIDIA MARTINEZ : I was in my nightgown, and I thought it was my next-door neighbor. And I went to the door, and nine officers from the Attorney General's Office walked in. And they had a search warrant, and they told me that they were there because I had filed a complaint that seniors were not getting their mail ballots. And I said, \"Yes, I did.\" And he says, \"Do you have the names?\" And I said, \"I have a few of the names.\" And they came in, and I said, \"Can I get dressed?\" They didn't let me.\n\nThey sat me down, and they started searching all my house - my storeroom, my garage, my kitchen, everything. And after two hours of questioning, they took me outside in front of all my neighbors and all the officers around me and - for half an hour while they searched the living room where I had been sitting. And after half an hour, they let me go back in the house, and they continued the questioning and asking me about LULAC members, in particular. And I told them, \"Why are you all doing this?\" And he said, \"Because there was fraud.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : LULAC is calling on the Justice Department to investigate Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton over the raids. This comes as ProPublica and The Texas Tribune report Paxton has also used consumer protection law more than a dozen times to investigate a range mostly Latino-led organizations or groups who offer food and shelter to migrants and asylum seekers along the border. Paxton also tried to shut down the immigrant-led civil rights group FIEL in Houston, claiming it engaged in electioneering, but a judge recently shot down his effort.\n\nAll of this comes as prosecutors agreed in March to drop securities fraud charges against Paxton himself, that allowed him to avoid going to trial if he performed a hundred hours of community service. This is separate from more recent corruption allegations Paxton faced that led to his impeachment trial last year, in which he was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Texas Senate.\n\nFor more, we go to Houston, where we're joined by Cesar Espinosa, executive director of FIEL , which is the Spanish acronym for Families of Immigrants and Students in the Struggle. And in Miami, Florida, we're joined by Juan Proaño, CEO of LULAC , the largest and oldest Latino civil rights group in the United States.\n\nJuan, let's begin with you. Explain what happened last week in Texas.\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: Well, good morning, Amy. Thank you for having me.\n\nAs you said, you know, last Tuesday, to our knowledge, over 12 search warrants were actually presented to Latino leaders, LULAC members in San Antonio. In the case of Lidia, as you just described, eight armed officers came in. But in another case, Manuel Medina, almost 40 officers, armed with AK-47s, SWAT gear, came in - tactical gear, came into his home at 6 a.m. His daughter was sleeping on the couch downstairs, thought someone was breaking into the home. He was upstairs with his wife and his other daughters. They came downstairs. And they were held, interrogated for over seven hours.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Juan Proaño, what does this tell you about the efforts of officials in Texas to intimidate Latino voters?\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: Well, I mean, you know, it's pervasive. You know, we've been, obviously, doing a lot of research here. And it didn't start last week. You know, this investigation on election integrity started over two years ago, essentially, at this point, also referred by another Republican district attorney there with no evidence at all whatsoever.\n\nIn June, we saw that they sued the archdiocese of Rio Grande Valley, Sister Norma Pimentel, which provides migrants with services that are in this country legally. Then we saw last month with Annunciation House, which provides refugee services, as well, obviously with FIEL , too, and we also saw 12 other nonprofits that effectively have gone through the same search and seizure process.\n\nAt least what we've heard from the courts, that this is unconstitutional. Effectively, the tort law that he's using to, essentially, sue nonprofit organizations because they're providing - because they're 501(c)(3) organizations and providing services to immigrants is really blatant discrimination.\n\nYou know, our expectation was that he would, obviously, come after LULAC and sue LULAC , but, certainly, we were very surprised when he started to go after Latino leaders and actual LULAC members. Of those 12 that we know of, four of them are LULAC members, three of them are women in their eighties. And they were told not to talk to anyone post the search and seizure. They took their cellphones. They took their computers. They took documentations. In the case of Lidia, they took her calendar, which is essentially where she keeps all her doctor's appointments, personal contacts, information about her prescription medicine. And she had just been to the doctor the day before and had to go back in order to get that. And so, she was left without any communication device at all to communicate with her family, and had to literally leave her home, go to another LULAC member's house to get assistance.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about the timing of this, Juan Proaño? For the first time in LULAC's history, established in 1929, LULAC's Adelante PAC , the political action committee, endorsed Harris and Walz, endorsed Kamala Harris to be president. Do you think that there is a direct link? And explain the different parts of your organization.\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: Sure. And thank you, Amy, for that question. So, LULAC , to your point, was founded in 1929 in Corpus Christi. It was actually founded as a 501(c)(4) organization. That is the entity that everyone effectively knows and commonly refers to, essentially, as LULAC . We have over 535 councils around the country. Every single one of those councils is incorporated. They actually carry the LULAC name and seal. We have over 240,000 members in all 50 states, and we have actually those 535 councils in 33 states and 207 cities. So we are the largest Latino membership organization in the country.\n\nIn addition to that, we have a 501(c)(3), which is our LULAC National Institute. So, all of the programmatic work that we do to provide programs and services to the Latino community is actually done through our 501(c)(3). The 501(c)(3) is actually incorporated in the District of Columbia.\n\nAnd then, more recently, we actually established the LULAC Adelante PAC . And so, it's actually a super PAC . And actually it's incorporated in District of Columbia.\n\nYou know, I don't believe that it is actually connected specifically to the PAC , primarily because all of the lawsuits and, essentially, the pattern of lawsuits are primarily targeting nonprofit organizations, and specifically 501(c)(3) organizations. They also only have purview over corporations that are founded in the state of Texas. So, you know, Paxton cannot go after the LULAC National Institute, the 501(c)(3) or the LULAC Adelante PAC . But, you know, obviously, it was very close in time. I believe the date of the endorsement was August 9th or August 10th, so less than two weeks ago at this point.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Juan, I wanted to ask you about a separate matter also related to elections. On Monday, the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, announced that the state has removed over 1 million names from the Texas voter rolls. Now, purges are common in many states, but that's a big number, and it's obviously coming so close to the election.\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: Yeah. I mean, look, we actually saw that. It came out about 5:00. You know, we started our advocacy campaign on Thursday night. It literally took us two days to get information about Lidia's case and to begin to gather all the facts relevant to this case.\n\nReally, it is his form of deflection, right? It's his effort to basically say, \"Look, you know, we have a million people that are on our voter rolls that we effectively are removing.\" I actually went through those numbers. Over 467,000 of them, essentially, are deceased, right? Another 400,000 or so are, effectively, what they call in the suspended mode, but only 6,500 of those are actually what are classified, effectively, as noncitizens. So you're talking about .0065%. Less than 1% of those are actually noncitizens. And only 1,900, which is 1/1000th of a percent of that million, have actually any voting history at all whatsoever. But to say that there is systemic voter fraud and voter harvesting happening in the state of Texas is absolutely false.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Juan Proaño, in a minute, we want to ask about LULAC's study of Project 2025. But we want to bring in Cesar Espinosa, the executive director of FIEL , Families of Immigrants and Students in the Struggle. Cesar, can you start off by talking about what happened in your new office, your old destroyed by a hurricane, about the serving of a lawsuit against you by the attorney general, who himself is under investigation and went through an impeachment trial, now is serving community service, but he's also doing this?\n\nCESAR ESPINOSA : Well, so, we, unfortunately, lost our office. FIEL has been here in Houston for the last 17 years. And in the 17 years, we helped out so many Houstonians, regardless of their immigration status, recover from natural disasters. So, just a few days after hurricane hit or a day after hurricane hit, Beryl hit - excuse me - I was talking to my family about the fact that I was ready to get back out there, ready to serve our community and serve people and help people get back on their feet.\n\nUnfortunately, though, this was not the case. We were hit by two storms: number one, the actual physical storm of Beryl, and then, second, the first day we moved into our new building, we were served with a lawsuit by the state of Texas, which really took us off guard.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what does this lawsuit say? What have you been sued for?\n\nCESAR ESPINOSA : This lawsuit was stating that we were electioneering by a series of social media posts who were interpreted by the attorney general of Texas as advocating for a certain party or certain issues. But at the end of the day, our institution and our work is based on educating the community, empowering the community, and getting community members from all walks of life to be integrated fully into U.S. society.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the lawsuit was - Harris County Judge R.K. Sandill denied Paxton's efforts? Could you talk about what the judge said?\n\nCESAR ESPINOSA : Well, at the end of the day, the judge, Sandill, declared that the Attorney General Ken Paxton did not have standing in the case, that he was going too far. And at the end of the day, the case was dismissed. But this sends, really, alarms all over the state of Texas to many organizations who are trying to help our community and that they could be targeted, as well.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what kind of support have you received across Texas as a result of this attack by the attorney general?\n\nCESAR ESPINOSA : Well, we are really overwhelmed by the amount of community support that we've received, the amount of support online, a lot of people coming forward and saying that the attorney general has gone too far. You know, I always tell my wife never to read the comments in the articles or things like that, but I myself went in and read. And what I read and what I gathered from all the articles, all the - everything that was published, is the fact that people from all walks of life, from any side of the political spectrum, are feeling that this attorney general is going way too far.\n\nAnd then, on the heels of this, we hear about what LULAC is going through. And it's just one thing after another after another. Then they challenged the parole-in-place program. So, there's so many things that they're doing trying to disenfranchise, trying to disillusion Latinos from participating, that it's really like we are swimming up - swimming against the current here in the state of Texas.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Juan Proaño, as we listen to what's happened to Cesar Espinosa and you describe the raids on your members, including the home of an 87-year-old, 35-year volunteer of LULAC , can you talk about what you're demanding of the Justice Department, a review of these Texas raids, and how Paxton's actions fit into the changing politics and demographics of Texas?\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: So, you know, first and foremost, we stand in solidarity with Cesar and FIEL . They are doing absolutely incredible work. And in regards to Lidia, not only is she 87 years old, Amy, she is a grandmother, she is a great-grandmother. Her five brothers actually served in the military. One of her brothers was killed in the Vietnam War and received the Silver Star. These are American U.S. citizens, right? And so, you know, for us, it really kind of sort of goes beyond the pale, in regards to what these actions are.\n\nWe have actually reached out to the Department of Justice. We have actually sent a letter requesting an investigation of these voter suppression tactics currently underway in Texas. We will continue to stand strong, and we are organizing our allies, both in the African American and the Latino community, as well. We're going to stand, and we're going to fight.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Juan Proaño, could you talk also about LULAC's new report , \"The Battle Ahead: Latino Civil Rights vs. Project 2025\"?\n\nJUAN PROAÑO: Sure, Juan. And I apologize. There was one part there that I didn't answer for Amy, a little bit about the demographics. So, in the last U.S. Census report put out by the Census Bureau, they reported that 12.1 million Latinos in the state of Texas. For the first time - right? - and really for some time now, Latinos actually outnumber non-Hispanic whites, which is at 12 million, OK? So, when you take into account not just the Latino population in the state of Texas, but the African American and Asian population, and even if you factored in two races or more, the minority community in Texas now stands at over 60%. Texas is and has been a majority-minority state. And so, that large demographic shift that you are seeing, you know, is prevalent. And so, we see these, effectively, as tactics for the Republicans to actually stay in control of the government in Texas. The demographics are shifting. They're not going to be able to change that anytime soon. And they are going to have to deal with that sooner than later.\n\nIn regards to Project 2025, LULAC actually published a couple weeks ago really the first and only report that I see that analyzed Project 2025 through a Latino lens. Obviously, it's been very widely reported throughout. It was obviously very prevalent in the Democratic National Convention's platform. In Chicago, we were there to listen to Vice President Harris and Walz actually speak to that.\n\nYou know, I was very concerned, shocked, when I was watching the Republican National Convention on that Tuesday and they came out with \"mass deportation\" signs. You know, somebody thought about that. Somebody designed those signs. They ordered them. They printed them. They passed them out to thousands of people in that convention center.\n\nThat's only one part of what is in Project 2025. You know, they're talking about, effectively, programs which effectively are for unserved communities, of gutting that, the Department of Education, as well, limiting different types of visas which allow for pathways for citizenship into this country. It is systemic all the way through. It would impact not only Latino communities but other immigrant and minority communities across the country. And not just minority communities, it would impact a significant number of non-Hispanic whites, because it really cuts across socioeconomic factors, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both so much for being with us. Juan Proaño is CEO of LULAC . He was speaking to us from Miami, Florida. And Cesar Espinosa is executive director of FIEL in Houston, Families of Immigrants and Students in the Struggle. You can see all of our segments on the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and immigration and Project 2025 at democracynow.org.

Last year, the Smithsonian Institution opened a temporary preview exhibition inside the National Museum of American History that has become the focus of controversy within the Latino community, as Republican lawmakers and others challenge what one conservative writer described in The Hill as an \"unabashedly Marxist portrayal of history.\" We speak to two historians who were hired to develop a now-shelved exhibit on the Latino civil rights movement of the 1960s for the museum. Felipe Hinojosa is a history professor at Baylor University in Texas, and Johanna Fernández is an associate professor of history at the City University of New York's Baruch College. We discuss their vision for the first national museum dedicated to Latino history, which Hinojosa describes as \"complex\" and \"nuanced,\" and how conservative backlash has sought to stymie and rewrite their work. \"These conservatives are using fear to essentially push through their agenda,\" says Fernández, who warns that the rising wave of censorship throughout the U.S. could be a \"repeat of the Red Scare.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe turn now to look at a brewing controversy at the Smithsonian Institution over plans to build a National Museum of the American Latino. In 2020, Congress passed funding to create the museum, along with an American Women's History Museum, but there's been a deep divide in Washington over how Latinos should be portrayed in the museum. Last year, the museum opened a temporary exhibit inside the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The exhibition is called \"¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States.\" Republican lawmakers and other conservatives within the Latino community have attacked the exhibition, leading the Smithsonian to halt plans for a future exhibition on the Latino civil rights movement of the 1960s. In its place, the Smithsonian is now planning an exhibition on salsa and Latin music. This fight is exploding into public view in the midst of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs from September 15th to October 15th.\n\nThis is Jorge Zamanillo, the founding director of the National Museum of the American Latino, giving a brief tour of the current exhibit in a video posted by the Smithsonian.\n\nJORGE ZAMANILLO : Well, Latino history is American history. And to tell that full story and to tell that full history, we have to acknowledge our colonial past. So, here, we feature a portrait of Popé, the sculpture. He's a Tewa leader, organized the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. We feature Toypurina, who was a medicine woman. That was a post-colonial rule. So these are important stories to feature and highlight how important they are in shaping our future. And these communities were around for hundreds of years before European colonization. So that's important on how that led to shaping our history. ...\n\nLulu, in \"¡Presente!,\" we further explore how racism and colorism developed during the colonial period. And we have a few examples from Puerto Rico that illustrate this point for visitors. This 1973 poster by Augusto Marín emphasizes that role of Black Puerto Ricans in the abolition of slavery on their island in 1873. We can also find deep historical meaning in Latino music and dance traditions. This outfit belonged to Tata Cepeda, an icon of Puerto Rican Bomba music. Bomba is a family of rhythms and dances with African and Caribbean roots that has historically offered Black Puerto Ricans a space for creative resistance and renewal.\n\nBringing it back to today, here's a great photo by Joaquin Medina documenting the Black Lives Matter movement in Puerto Rico. For us at the museum, \"Latino\" is a label that brings together racially and regionally diverse communities. Representing both our commonalities and our differences is a core part of our work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Jorge Zamanillo, the founding director of the National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nOne vocal critic of the museum's exhibition has been the Cuban-born Congressmember Mario Díaz-Balart, who threatened in July to block funding for the museum - he serves on the House Committee on Appropriations - and later backed down on his threat after he met with Jorge Zamanillo and Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the overall Smithsonian Institution. After the meeting, the museum changed parts of the exhibit featuring a foam raft used by Cuban refugees to flee the country. The original exhibition text said the refugees were, quote, \"escaping Cuba's economic crisis.\" In July, the text was changed to add a reference to Fidel Castro and, quote, \"Cuba's dictatorship, political repression, and economic crisis,\" unquote. Some of the first public criticism of the current exhibition came from a group of conservative writers who penned a column in The Hill last year claiming the exhibit offered a, quote, \"unabashedly Marxist portrayal of history,\" unquote.\n\nThe controversy comes as the Smithsonian is seeking to raise enough money to build the museum, which will cost an estimated $800 million. The New York Times reports $58 million has been raised so far.\n\nWe're joined now by two historians who have been hired to develop the now-shelved exhibit on the Latino civil rights movement of the '60s for the museum. Felipe Hinojosa is a history professor at Baylor University in Texas. He's also the author of the book Apostles of Change: Latino Radical Politics, Church Occupations, and the Fight to Save the Barrio . Johanna Fernández is an associate professor of history at the City University of New York's Baruch College. She's also the author of The Young Lords: A Radical History of the United States.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Johanna Fernández, let's begin with you. What has happened? I mean, the idea that this museum was going to be built either across the Mall from the Museum of African American History or in the Tidal Basin, but this, your \"¡Presente!\" exhibit, has led to this kind of uprising on the right. Can you explain what the current exhibit is, what the one that has been shelved is, at least for now, that you and Professor Hinojosa have been the creators of?\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: \"¡Presente!\" - well, thank you for covering this evolving crisis. \"¡Presente!\" is the current exhibition at the Molina Family Gallery within the American History Museum at the Smithsonian. It's an exhibition in waiting while the actual building of the Latino History Museum goes up in 10 to 12 years.\n\nWhat is important about \"¡Presente!\" is that it really outlines the contours of Latino history, which are complicated. One of the points it makes is that the largest Latino population in the United States was integrated after the United States war with Mexico in 1848, which is responsible for giving the United States its contemporary boundaries. Half of the United States was acquired during that war, and the people who were in those Mexican lands remained in the now borders of the United States. And the integration of those people into a hostile America is part of American history. The \"¡Presente!\" exhibition also highlights the acquisition by the United States of Puerto Rico in 1898 and also discusses the ways in which U.S. foreign policy and economic policy has driven people out of Latin America and into the United States. So, what's important is that it establishes the question: Who are Latinos? How did they get here? And what's their relationship to their communities and to the nation and the world?\n\nUnfortunately, conservative Latinos don't want to hear that narrative. They want a narrative that emphasizes Latino military service and business success among Latinos in the United States.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Felipe Hinojosa, you come from - you work and come from Texas, a state at the forefront of some of the culture wars that we're experiencing today. Could you talk about how you learned of the concern here, and what you were told by folks at the Smithsonian about what needed to change or didn't need to change in terms of the work you were doing?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA : Well, thank you, first off, for having me.\n\nYes, I am from Texas. I'm from the Rio Grande Valley, born and raised in Brownsville, Texas. That has shaped a big part of who I am. It shapes a big part of the work that I do.\n\nWriting about and teaching on the Latino civil rights movement has been a centerpiece of the work that I do and that I've collaborated with other historians in doing. And I think in joining with this work with the Smithsonian, I think, for me, the biggest joy and the biggest thrill was to be able to present these questions that Johanna has just mentioned. The larger and broader questions of who are we and who are we as a community and what is our relationship to the nation were central questions for Latino civil rights activists in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWe worked on this exhibit, on the \"Latino Youth Movements\" exhibit, with the Smithsonian for two years. We were 65% complete. And the sort of rumblings that started to happen came immediately after the piece that was published in The Hill . I believe it was summer of 2022 when that came out. And there was some concern in terms of the kind of material that we would be presenting. But I think, for us, our major concern was to just make sure that we were telling a truthful story, a complex story and a nuanced story about how Latinos have grappled with their relationship to the United States.\n\nThe critiques that came to us and what we were told in terms of what could be and could not be included, I think, were alarming to us. And when the email came in November of 2022 that this exhibit was going to be paused or canceled, I think it confirmed our fears of the fact that the Smithsonian was not viewing the Latino civil rights movement as a broad enough story, as a story that would raise the kind of funds that this museum needs to open in 10 or 12 years. And I think, from the work, certainly, that we have done and the work that we were engaged in for two years, nothing could be further than the truth. What's bigger and what's more, I think, central than young people asking themselves and their communities how they can make this a nation that is better for all?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Johanna Fernández, this whole issue of political leaders putting pressure on a museum to basically override the historians that the museum has chosen to develop its exhibitions?\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: Well, I think we have to look at this conflict in the broader history of the last 10 years, when conservatives have launched a calculated and broad-sweeping campaign to essentially eliminate the teaching of Black American history, Latino history, ethnic studies, women's history and LGBTQ+ history in the schools. And now what we see is that through this witch hunt and by smearing historians and curators as Marxists, these conservatives are using fear to essentially push through their agenda. And now, again, this has reached a federal museum, and not just any federal museum, but the largest network of museums in the world, which is known as the Smithsonian. In many ways, this sounds and looks like a repeat of the Red Scare or previous moments of repression in the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Professor Fernández, what is your response to them sending you this email saying they're putting your next exhibition on pause? To be clear, \"¡Presente!\" is now in that temporary National American History Museum space, and the one you're doing on the civil rights movement is the one that is paused, saying that they want to appeal to a larger audience, especially because they're fundraising, and so they'll shelve the civil rights issue and do instead an exhibition on salsa music and Latin music.\n\nJOHANNA FERNÁNDEZ: I think we have to say that there is no more integral matter in the United States than the struggle for freedom, democracy and to redefine the United States as a country for all. That's integral and core to the American imagination. So, to say that this issue is a minor one is really to not understand the very essence of American history, upon which the American Revolution and its determination to fight for liberty and the pursuit of happiness is core.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor Hinojosa, I wanted to ask you, in terms of the - in Texas itself, there clearly is a very significant and strong conservative population in the Latino community. So, not only is this a national ethnic struggle, there's also a class component to how people view history. What's your sense of why it is so important to tell the story as you have researched it and looked into it throughout your career versus what some of the political leaders of your state might want?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA : Well, first of all, I would say a lot of political leaders are often disconnected from the grassroots community. They don't understand what the community is asking for. I've been in the classroom for over 20 years. Students are wanting more of this history, wanting to better understand how Latinos have shaped Texas politics, have shaped the history of the United States - and not just Latino students, by the way. I'm talking to students of all backgrounds that are very invested in telling a bigger story of American history and having a broader understanding of it.\n\nThe other thing is demographic change, the demographics of the state of Texas. Texas is now a Latino-majority state. And so, to have those demographic changes that have taken place in the last 20 years across the state, I think, signaled to us a tremendous responsibility to teach this history, to have a better understanding of the contributions of this community. We are not perpetual foreigners. We are not people that are new to this nation. We have contributed for generations to make this country what it is today, and in particular in my home state of Texas.\n\nAnd the idea is not to simply talk about a liberal-versus-conservative idea of history. The idea here is to tell a story that is complex, that is nuanced and that gets at this idea of democracy, that gets at how different people from different sections of society have made this country what it is today, and I think in particular the state of Texas. I mean, there's a reason why Texas history classes fill up the way that they do at universities across my home state of Texas. People love this history. They respect it. They admire it, as they should. But we need a bigger telling of it. We need a bigger story, a story that brings in marginalized voices, voices that have been silenced throughout history. And I think our exhibit was one small step to try to do that, not only at the state level, but at the national level.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you give, perhaps, some examples of [inaudible] that you wanted to put forth in the civil rights exhibit, especially in terms of Texas, a history that many Americans perhaps may not be aware of, whether it's the Crystal City uprising in the early '60s or other aspects of Texas Latino history?\n\nFELIPE HINOJOSA : Yeah. In particular, we were looking at the ways in which Latinos in the state of Texas and across the Southwest and across the country have not waited for the nation to do something for us. We're not sitting idly by. Historically, what we've done is we've taken matters into our own hands for political participation.\n\nYou mentioned Crystal City, in 1963 gaining ground to the Crystal City's City Council. There was a group of five Mexican Americans that won those City Council seats. That was a huge, huge shift and, I think, a call to the state of Texas that Mexican Americans were serious about political participation. They went on to form La Raza Unida Party. They ran a candidate for a governor here in the state of Texas. And that's the kind of history that we want to tell, one of agency, one of power, one that gets at how Latinos have not simply waited on but have acted upon to make this country more democratic and more representative for all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Hinojosa, we want to thank you for being with us, of Baylor University in Texas, and Johanna Fernández, professor of history at the City University of New York: Baruch College. And, Juan, thank you so much for your book, Harvest of Empire: Stories of Latinos in America .

Most of the false messaging disparages Kamala Harris and supports Donald Trump, says Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, host of Latino USA , which investigated the phenomenon in a new episode called \"The Misinformation Web.\" She interviewed some of the content creators in this \"blob\" of online vitriol and says there is almost no effective content moderation online, nor many reliable fact-checking sources in Spanish to counter the lies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe look now at how Spanish-language misinformation is targeting Latinx voters, a key demographic that could determine the outcome of this presidential election in key battleground states, including Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, where both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made dueling campaign stops on Monday. Trump's campaign continues to face widespread backlash over racist comments made by a far-right, so-called comedian who described Puerto Rico as an \"island of garbage\" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally.\n\nOn Monday, Harris spent some of the last hours before Election Day in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a Latinx-majority city home to some 34,000 Puerto Ricans. Her visit came just days after Trump also spoke there. Pennsylvania has some 600,000 eligible Latinx voters, while one study found Arizona, another swing state, has 1.3 million registered Latinx voters, the fourth-largest Latinx voter bloc in the nation.\n\nLatinx-led grassroots groups have largely backed Kamala Harris, are leading get-out-the-vote campaigns while also fighting the spread of mis- and disinformation. Spanish-speaking communities have been bombarded by false claims, conspiracies and fake news on social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and X, formerly Twitter, as well as WhatsApp channels. Voting rights groups also warn of the use of artificial intelligence, AI, to generate fake election content in Spanish.\n\nWell, Futuro Media and Latino USA looked into \"The Misinformation Web\" targeting Spanish speakers in the U.S., much of it propagated by conservative content creators living outside the U.S. This is a clip of host Maria Hinojosa talking to a man from Venezuela who goes by Juan Torres. He supposedly lives in Iceland and runs two YouTube channels.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : So I asked him what he thinks about Trump being a convicted felon. He says those charges, they're all lies. When I tell him that it's a fact that Donald Trump has been convicted of multiple felonies, Juan says it's all a witch hunt. Ultimately, Donald Trump was found guilty by a jury of his peers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Maria Hinojosa, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, founder of Futuro Media, host of Latino USA , which has this new investigation podcast on \"The Misinformation Web.\"\n\nMaria, welcome back to Democracy Now! So, lay out who Juan Torres is and also just your overall investigation.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Well, the investigation really, it ended up taking us, Amy and Juan, to where we didn't expect to be, right? Because both of the content creators - we'll be nice and call them content creators - live outside of the United States. They are not American citizens. They don't plan on being able to vote or move to this country anytime soon. And yet, John Acquaviva and Juan Torres, both Venezuelan, both under 30, both in Spanish, have YouTube channels, even though one is based outside of London and the other one is based allegedly in Iceland. We did meet John Acquaviva in person in London, and so I'm pretty sure that he does live in that area.\n\nBut, basically, here's the thing, Amy. We understood that the Latino electorate was going to be central in terms of deciding this election today. And if you had intelligence, you were watching what was happening in terms of mis- and disinformation being flooded into Latino communities. What do I mean? So, yeah, four years ago, there were probably memes already about Kamala as a communist, dressed in a Mao Zedong outfit and at a so-called Communist Party office with a flag behind her. The Democrats and the party and the campaign did not really take it as seriously, so therefore the misinformation just spread, spread, spread instead of being met with a wall of facts. And so, that's why you have, you know, unexpectedly more Latinos and Latinas who are turning to Trump, because they have been fed two things: one, that Kamala is essentially a communist and a socialist, and, two, that Donald Trump is an excellent businessman and is going to do amazing things for the U.S. economy.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Maria, could you talk about the under-the-radar impact of a lot of this right-wing, Spanish-language, especially social media usage, throughout Latin America, that even some of the major social media companies are clearly not moderating their content at the same level in Spanish as they are in English?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Yeah. You, basically, on YouTube, have about - I think it's about 28,000 moderators for, what, a billion views in a day, for example. It just doesn't match with what we're being faced with. The way I felt about it, Juan - and, you know, we're of a similar generation, right? So, this is, for those of us who have grown up doing journalism on the frontlines, you know, just like I was reporting from my precinct in Harlem where I voted at 6:00 in the morning, that kind of frontline going to a community, meeting with people face to face. This kind of journalism is met with young men, a very bro-ey culture, that yell at their screens, but in an attractive way, in a dramatic way, and basically repeat lies that they - one of them, Juan Torres, says, he's like, \"Twitter, X, is my only source.\" It's like, \"Oh my god. That's scary.\" It feels completely out of control. It feels like the blob. That's the only image that I can say, right? This blob that is now - how do you put the genie back in the bottle? And again, the problem is, for Latinos and Latinas and for those of us who speak Spanish, there are less places to do the triple sourcing, triple fact-checking that you learn in basic media literacy, and therefore that's why the lies continue to get propagated.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to another clip from your Latino USA investigation , \"The Misinformation Web.\" This features one of the men you're talking about, John Acquaviva, a content creator who became more actively engaged in U.S. politics in the lead-up to this election. You met him in London at a hotel. This is him.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Ten minutes into our conversation, John, just like Juan Torres, tries to provoke a debate with me. So, let me ask you, though: Why would you put -\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : [inaudible] What's the problem? Obviously, you're the producer against drones, but that's just a different subject, isn't it?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : What did you say?\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : Obviously, you do see a problem with it, because you're against drones. So, that's your opinion. I can have mine.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Wait a second. What are you talking about?\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : I've seen your opinions about gun control.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Opinions?\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : Yeah.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : You'd have to specifically show me something that shows an opinion.\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : You've spoken endlessly about mass shootings.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Endlessly.\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : Yeah.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : OK.\n\nJOHN ACQUAVIVA : I actually have some quotes. You want to read them?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : No.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's John Acquaviva. But I found something really interesting in your podcast between John and Juan, and both being Venezuelan. You ask them why the U.S. election matters to you so much, and they're saying because it can ultimately affect the shaping of a new Venezuela.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Oh, yeah. And John Acquaviva wants to run for president of Venezuela. You know, of course, again, they both say that they are entirely focused on Venezuela, and yet they don't live there, and they're not these days talking about Venezuelan politics. They're obsessed with U.S. politics. But essentially, it would be the trickle down. If Trump wins - and both of them are Trump supporters - if Trump wins, that means that there is a possibility, of course, even of military intervention in Venezuela. I mean, we don't have that in terms of a policy position, but of course that could happen.\n\nMy problem with where they stand on Venezuela is that they don't really go beyond the immediate of just let's get Trump elected, because, of course, I said, \"Well, Trump is planning on having a mass deportation policy. That means tens of thousands of your fellow Venezuelans are going to be deported from the United States into Venezuela. How is that possibly going to benefit your country?\" They didn't have an answer for that. But the thing is, is that if Hugo Chávez had never existed, these two guys, who are spreading mis- and disinformation and lies, would not exist. So, there's a trickle of - that leads to misinformation, sadly, right now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Maria, in one video, Torres claims that Kamala Harris supports Soviet-style policies, even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. This whole effort to paint Kamala Harris as a communist, how is that playing among Latin Americans here in the U.S.?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Well, you know, Juan, that for Cubans - right? - the anti-communism, that piece of their history is very real, right? And there is a lot of trauma that we cannot diminish, because they were - in essence, had to leave their country, never to be able to go back. That is a lot of the South Florida political reality, right? Enter Venezuelans, who are escaping from a horrible economy in Venezuela and, you know, a real [inaudible] down of the democratic process in Venezuela over the past several years. So, they come also with the trauma of, you know, alleged communism, socialism. The problem for those of us who have a critical analysis - right? - is that communism and socialism are very profound, deep concepts, and I don't believe that they have existed in either one of those places. But there is a -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, of course, they're the target of fierce U.S. sanctions to this day.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Fierce U.S. sanctions. But you know what? The point is, is that if you are getting Social Security in the United States today and you're benefiting from that, welcome to socialism in the United States of America. So, people don't understand that, in fact, the policies that they critique are many of the ones that they're going to be benefiting from. But the point of the story is that there is a vacuum of people who hear \"communist,\" \"socialist,\" scary. It's going to change the United States. It's going to become like Cuba. It's going to become like Venezuela.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Three seconds.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : And they're going to vote for Donald Trump. That's what we've seen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Maria Hinojosa, we thank you so much for being with us. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Much of the increased turnout was powered by people of color, while the total number of votes cast by white Americans barely increased from the last presidential election. \"The main story is that in an election which saw historic turnout, people of color - and especially Latinos - had an unprecedented increase in voting,\" says Democracy Now! co-host Juan González. \"After decades of political experts talking about the growing Latino vote, this year it actually happened.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President-elect Joe Biden's lead in the popular vote has jumped to over 5 million as President Trump continues to refuse to concede. About 160 million voters cast ballots. This is a new record. Much of the increased turnout was powered by people of color, while the total number of votes cast by white Americans barely increased from the last presidential election. Well, Juan, your analysis has been absolutely critical. That's right, Democracy Now! 's Juan González has been closely looking at how the historic turnout in the Latinx community has impacted the race. Lay it out for us.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Amy, the cascade of stories continues, claiming a surprising turn by Latino voters toward Donald Trump. The New York Times this week, front page , quote, \"How Democrats Missed Trump's Appeal to Latino Voters.\" Then, the L.A. Times , \"Latino voters tired of being taken for granted by baffled Democrats.\" CNN and others claiming there's no such thing as a Latino bloc. And even The Intercept saying in one of their stories that \"Nonwhite Voters Are Not Immune to Right-Wing Populism.\"\n\nWell, I said last week , and I'll repeat it again, the key narrative of this election is not whether there was a small shift in the percentage of Latinx voters in some areas of the country turning toward Trump. The main story is that in an election which saw historic turnout, people of color - and especially Latinos - had an unprecedented increase in voting. And they, not white voters, represented the bulk of that increase. Virtually none of the reports have mentioned this, that for the first time in U.S. history Latinos' turnout appears to have reached comparable levels to the rates for white and Black Americans. Twenty-point-six million Latinos went to the polls in this election. That's 64% of the 32 million eligible Latinx voters, while in previous election cycles the turnout had been routinely below 50%. In raw numbers, 8 million more Latinos voted this year than in 2016. That's a 63% increase over the last presidential elections.\n\nNow, I've updated and tweaked the chart from last week, and it shows that the biggest increase in both percentages and actual votes from four years ago came from Latino voters. Their jump in number of ballots cast nearly equaled that among white - the increase among white and Black voters combined. The next biggest jump, in percentage term, came among African American voters, who increased by 20%, Asian Americans by 16%, while white voters increased by just under 6%.\n\nNow, some of these numbers, I should note, are different from what I displayed last week, in part because there's been some little-noticed changes to the Edison national exit poll in the past few days compared to what was released on Election Day by all the networks. For instance, the original version estimated that whites were 65% of the electorate, while the latest figures say that they were 67%. And the poll also increases turnout for African Americans and Asians. Well, the Edison poll has always been flawed, and numerous analyses have shown its past samples were skewed to oversampling Cuban Americans, undersampling both Black and Latino inner-city polling sites, and also undersampling voters whose primary language is not English, all of which means it tends to undercount Latino voters for Democrats.\n\nBut the basic contours of the sampling remains the same, and it's inescapable. After decades of political experts talking about the growing Latino vote, this year it actually happened. Hispanic voters felt compelled like never before to go to the polls, because COVID -19 fell them more than other groups, because of the constant demonization of Latinos by the president, because of the barbaric family separation policies, or because of the threats to healthcare, even, for some conservative Latinos, because of their hopes of finally turning back Roe v. Wade . One thing is sure: Neither the Democratic nor Republican parties will underestimate or ignore Latino voters from now on. This should be cause for widespread celebration as a long-awaited democratization of the vote.\n\nBut what about those who claim that Trump made major, unexpected inroads among Latino voters nationwide, as reflected by 66-to-32% split of the Latino vote between Biden and Trump? Some say that Latinos could be deserting the Democratic Party. Those of us who've been around the block a few times have heard this narrative before. In reality, these results are in the general ballpark of previous presidential campaigns.\n\nI want to put up, hopefully, a chart here of how Latinos split their vote over the last 30 years in presidential elections. The Republican share of voters has varied, from a low of 27%, when Mitt Romney ran against Barack Obama in 2012, to a high of 44%, that George Bush got in his second presidential run in 2004. Even John McCain, when he ran against Obama in 2008, got a similar percentage of the Latino vote as Trump did this year. And the high point, the Bush victory in 2004, we should note, is the last time a Republican candidate got a majority of the popular vote.\n\nBut the big difference now is that the Latinx vote is so much larger. When you get two-thirds of a vote, that has tripled in size in just a few years, you begin to achieve critical mass. No wonder Lindsey Graham is warning that if these elections aren't changed somehow, Republicans will never win the White House again.\n\nWhat about those places like the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and South Florida, where Trump made real inroads in largely Latino districts in the actual vote? What about those pundits who claim Latinos are so diverse and diffuse as a population that it is erroneous to consider them a single community? First, on South [Florida] and the Rio Grande Valley, yes, actual vote results show that Trump had significant increases in his support there. Florida is not surprising, given the influx of conservative refugees from Nicaragua and Venezuela in recent years, but the Rio Grande Valley is.\n\nIn Hidalgo County, along the border, which is 90% Latino, Trump went from 27% against Hillary Clinton to 40% against Joe Biden. In Maverick County, which is 95% Latino, he went from 20% against Clinton to 45% against Biden. Those are significant numbers. The Valley, however, has changed rapidly during the Trump era. Always a socially conservative rural area, it has seen enormous job growth in recent years as a result of the militarization of the border, which brought thousands of new jobs to the area for Border Patrol officers, for workers on private construction of the wall with Mexico, for immigration detention centers. In addition, the Valley has replaced the San Diego sector as the epicenter of undocumented migrant crossings and the failed immigration system of the United States. All of that, no doubt, helped turn its residents for Trump.\n\nBut in the big cities of Texas, where most Latinos live, there's another story. San Antonio's Bexar County, for example, 60% Latino, saw Biden's margin of votes climb, from 54 to 58%, though we'll need better figures on how much of that was in the Latino community. It seems clear, however, that Latino turnout in states like Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania helped Biden win those key battleground states.\n\nAnd then there's California and New York. The Latino share of the vote that went to Biden appears to be breathtaking in those states: 77% in California, 72% in New York. Now, some argue that those are reliable blue states anyway, so those Hispanic voters are not really critical. Really? Aren't those enormous Latino margins year after year what has made those states reliably blue? And the same for New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and, lately, Colorado.\n\nThen there are these nonsensical questions as to whether a Latino community actually exists. Let's be clear: Latinx identity in the United States is a social construct, created both by the dominant society, that needed to define and categorize and other - other - and by the marginalized group itself, organically, from the ground, by disparate Latin American migrant groups who were forced to unite in order to survive in a hostile society and whose children gradually intermarried to create a new social construct: the Latino in America.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, I said in my book Harvest of Empire that Latinos had become - were becoming a new third force in American politics. They largely vote Democratic, but a significant portion is susceptible to Republican candidates if those political leaders address even a few of their concerns. Since then, Latin Americans from educated and middle-class backgrounds have migrated to this country in growing numbers, and a good portion have adopted typical American conservative views. Some of that community, though still a minority, have been drawn to right-wing populism, to national chauvinism, and even to racist views.\n\nAll of this fixation on Latinos, however, ignores the fundamental question of this election, which very few political observers I've seen have dared to tackle: Why the heck did 58% of white Americans vote for Donald Trump, including 55% of white women? With the United States consolidating itself as the world's most powerful imperialist nation and the economic gap in the country widening, right-wing movements have only grown at home, and the defeat of Trump will not halt their growth. The key to building a progressive majority is to keep mobilizing more young Latinos to vote, burying the small percentage increases in support for right-wing candidates under an avalanche from people of color, organized labor and their allies. And that's my take on this election.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Juan González, a just amazing deep dive into the numbers, so critical to understand this at this point, because, so early on, this is what shapes the narrative. And, you know, on Tuesday, the leading journalist Maria Hinojosa tweeted, quote, \"I'm listening to The Daily on what went wrong w the polls.\" She's referring to The New York Times ' Daily podcast. \"And,\" she goes on, \"just wow. With the issue that more white folks voted for trump right in front of us, the FIRST thing they do is talk abt Latino voters. It sounds like WE ARE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE for all of this! Two white guys on us.\" Maria Hinojosa continued, \"So Nate Cohen says 'the polls struggled w Latino voters.'\" And she says, \"The polls? How abt hiring the right Latino pollsters?? Of course we exist. This is so typical. It's never WE GOT IT WRONG . This time and four years ago-wrong. How abt 'We did not do our jobs.'\" If you can talk about that, getting it wrong, Juan? You're not only diving deep into the numbers, but you're deconstructing the narrative that's already coming out of this election.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah. Well, as I mentioned, the poll - there's one main poll. Of course, AP now has their own poll, but the numbers are pretty similar. But these pollsters have always had flaws, as the group Latino Decisions pointed out last time, because, remember, in 2016, the same narrative, that Latinos had moved unexpectedly toward Trump, was put out. People forget that. Four years ago, it was the same narrative. But when Latino Decisions did their analysis - and they had a much more extensive polling of the Latino community, plus they looked at the actual numbers - it came much later. It came months later after the election. And they showed that it was impossible, in some areas, in several areas of the country, for the Latino vote for Donald Trump to have been as high as the exit poll, the Edison exit poll, was claiming.\n\nAnd they clearly pointed out to what were the failings of the poll. One is that it has historically oversampled the Cuban American community in the overall Latino numbers. Two is that it does not - it has not really gone into overwhelmingly African American or Latino communities - it tends to do its polling on the day of Election Day in communities that are more racially mixed - and also that it historically underrepresents those people who don't speak English. As a result, the poll is, by its construction, skewed. And so, Latino Decisions saw significant differences between the exit poll and the actual Latino vote.\n\nNow, we don't have the full numbers yet. There are places like New York and California where they're still counting. There are millions and millions of votes, especially in the blue states, that have not yet been counted. So, this 5 million gap that Biden has is only going to grow. It's not going to get smaller; it's going to keep growing. And my estimate is it could possibly reach like 8 million, the difference in the vote. But so, I think that we're not going to get a full picture until we do the combination of the polling and the actual vote counts, precinct by precinct, around the country, to get a better sense of what has happened. So, it's going to take some time.\n\nAnd mark my word: Six months from now or a year from now, when we have better data, we're going to have to reassess what's happened, but I'm willing to go on what we have already, what we have already, to say that the key story here is not small shifts in percentages, it's raw increase in turnout. That is the key. That is the key. And once you look at the raw increase in turnout, you see that it is Latinx voters, African Americans, Asian Americans that are propelling the change in the electorate in the country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And in the coming days, we'll also be looking further into the Native American vote. I want to encourage people to go back to democracynow.org to see Juan González's original analysis last week in Part 1 of his analysis of the voters of this country.\n\nNext up, we're going to look at the election results in Puerto Rico. And then we'll look at the oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the Affordable Care Act. Is the conservative body going to vote to preserve it? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Earlier this month, Obama gave a major address to a mostly Latino audience in El Paso, Texas, calling for immigration reform. Juan Gonzalez joins us to discuss the history of Latinos in the United States and how it relates to U.S. political and military intervention in Latin America. Gonzalez, a Democracy Now! co-host and New York Daily News columnist, has just published an updated edition of his book, Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America . Originally released in 2000, the book explores the stories of Latinos from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and around the region. We air a few clips from a new documentary in production based on Harvest of Empire . [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Juan, your book, Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America , came out in 2000. So, it's 2011. You have completely revised it. Why put it out again?\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, first of all, it has continued to be adopted by many colleges across the country in college courses, and my publisher felt that a lot of the data had sort of gotten outdated in terms of some of the studies that I had been citing. But I also think that the main reason is that the Latino presence in America continues to grow at an astounding level, and most Americans still feel remarkably insecure and lack knowledge as to why this is happening. And you can see it by all the right-wing shows that are constantly stoking anti-immigrant fervor against undocumented immigrants in the country.\n\nAnd I think - I felt that it was necessary not only to update the figures, but to re-emphasize the enormous transformation that is occurring in the United States, that, for instance, the Census Bureau now projects that before 2050 one out of every three people living in the United States will be of Latino origin. And if the current trends continue, it is entirely possible that by the end of this century, by 2100, half of the entire population of the United States will trace its origins not to Europe, but to Latin America. This is an enormous transformation, when you consider that there were only a few million Latinos in the 1970s, representing about four percent of the population, and now you're talking about, by 2100, more than 50 percent of the entire nation.\n\nAnd of course, this is not just happening in the United States. The reality is that there's been an enormous transformation of the advanced countries of the world since World War II as the third world has come to the West. England doesn't know what to do about all the Indians, the Pakistanis and the Jamaicans. France doesn't know what to do about all the Algerians, Tunisians and Moroccans. Germany doesn't know what to do about all the Turks. The peoples of the colonial countries have come to the West since World War II, and they are transforming the very compositions of these nations, raising all kinds of questions about language and religion and culture. And in the United States, it's largely been the Latin Americans. As I show, between 1960 and 2008, more than 44 million people migrated to the United States, whether legally or illegally, and half of them were from Latin America, so that really the thrust of the immigration situation in the United States and the growth area is among the Latinos of the southern half of the hemisphere.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Juan, a documentary about Harvest of Empire is in the works right now. It won't be completed for a number of months. But I wanted to play a few of the rough cuts from the film. This is the indigenous Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchú, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for helping to publicize the plight of Guatemala's indigenous people under the brutal U.S.-backed government.\n\nRIGOBERTA MENCHÚ: [translated] Guatemala was unbelievable. Two hundred thousand dead that we have accounted for, 50,000 disappeared. Eighty-three percent of the disappeared and executed were Mayas. I left Guatemala after they burned my father alive in the embassy of Spain. They were asking for political asylum from the Spanish government. They were trying to save their lives by entering the embassy. But at that moment the Guatemalan security forces attacked the embassy. They burned everyone alive. No one survived - not the students, no one who was there. Is it possible that we can be safe from genocide? Can it be that we will not be victims of genocide tomorrow? I do not have any guarantees. If what exists in Guatemala is persecution, murder, killing, if what you have is insecurity, then I prefer to cross the border and go to a place with more security.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Rigoberta Menchu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, from the forthcoming documentary, Harvest of Empire . Father Roy Bourgeois is also interviewed in the documentary, who is the founder of the group School of the Americas Watch, speaking about El Salvador in the 1980s.\n\nFATHER ROY BOURGEOIS : I had never seen anything like El Salvador. I was more frightened there than Vietnam. I mean, I had never seen such brutality of a military toward their people. The death squads were running wild. What was going on there was the slaughter of the innocents. It was genocide.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : It was a war that was fought everywhere.\n\nFATHER ROY BOURGEOIS : Anyone against U.S. foreign policy or talking about land reform, they were labeled subversive, el enemigo , the enemy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Father Roy Bourgeois. This is a film that's being made based on Harvest of Empire , just a very rough cut. How this fits into immigration, Juan?\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I think the central theme of my book is that the - you cannot understand the enormous Latino presence in the United States unless you understand America's role in Latin America, and in fact that the Latino presence in the country is the harvest of the empire. It is the result of more than a century of domination of many of these countries. And in fact, those countries that were most dominated by the United States are the ones that have sent the most migrants to this country. And Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Salvador, Guatemala, these are the countries that have provided the bulk of the migration from Latin America, largely many of them fleeing from the civil wars, as in the cases of Guatemala and Nicaragua and El Salvador, in which the United States government played a key role in backing one side or the other, others coming here as a result of the needs of American businesses that established migration and recruiting, actually recruited people to come here to fill jobs - that's more so in the case of the Puerto Ricans and the Mexicans. And so, in essence, the migration flows, the mass migration flows of Latin Americans to this country were a direct response to the needs of the empire. Most Americans are not aware of that, because most Americans don't even think of our country as an empire.\n\nBut I think that what I've tried to do in the book is chart how each of the different Latino groups came, what was happening in their country that forced them to leave, how did - what cities did they first arrive in, how did they establish their communities, what kind of hostility or welcome did they meet when they arrived in these various cities around the country, and basically tried to sort of like paint a picture, the human picture, of how it was that this country is now facing this enormous explosion of Latino population.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We played the clip of Rigoberta Menchú and the images of the burning of the Spanish embassy in 1980. Explain its significance and how it fits into this larger picture.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I mean, as we have said often on Democracy Now! , the United States played a key role in all of the political events that happened in Guatemala going back to 1954, when the CIA , through Operation Success, basically organized the overthrow of a democratically elected government, the Arbenz government, and that led to a civil war that lasted -- the worst civil war in Latin America's history. And in the process, some people at one point tried to occupy the Spanish embassy. And the Guatemalan, the right-wing Guatemalan government attacked the embassy, burned it down, and killed many of the people inside, including relatives of Rigoberta Menchú. And --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Her father was killed.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Yes, her father was killed there. And so, you had this enormous ferment, a lot of it in response to U.S. government policies. In fact, it's only recently that the new popular government of Guatemala has actually apologized to the Arbenz family and agreed to pay compensation to the family. And it was only a few years ago that President Clinton himself finally acknowledged the genocide that had occurred in Guatemala of the Mayans. So that you have this long history that most Americans are not aware of. But when you ask, \"Well, why are all those Guatemalans working in chicken plants in North Carolina or in other parts of the country?\" or, \"Why is there such a huge Guatemalan population in Houston, Texas?\" it really was the people fleeing those civil wars that basically established those communities and sought refuge in the United States from the very policies that the United States government was behind. And so, you know, I try to sort of chart that in the book and show how now basically, though you have these migrants who are here in the United States, are really the main sustenance, economic sustenance, of many of their countries through the remittances they send each month or each week back to maintain members of their families back home.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The significance of the protests of this month, May, several years ago here in the United States, the largest ever?\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Right. Well, as I've said repeatedly, I believe they are the largest series of mass protests in the history of the United States. Between March and May of 2006, between three and five million people poured out into the streets of 160 cities across the country, demanding sort of an end to the demonization of immigrants, of undocumented immigrants, and some sort of path to citizenship or legality in the country. And it was subsequent to that that massive crackdowns occurred in the Bush administration - factory raids, mass deportations. And they have continued under the Obama administration, massive deportations of Latin Americans - very similar, I have to point out, as I do in the book, to mass deportations that occurred in the '50s against Mexicans, Operation Wetback, to mass deportations that occurred in the '30s under President Hoover, when more than a million Mexicans were rounded up, put on trains, and shipped back to Mexico - so that this is really the latest of a series of anti-immigrant raids or mass deportation programs that have occurred throughout U.S. history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Deportations have escalated under President Obama.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Yes, they've increased under President Obama. Now, there's not as many factory raids under President Obama, workplace raids, as there were under President Bush, but many more community raids of individual communities, in search of supposed felon immigrants, but really rounding up all kinds of people and getting them removed from the country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The most important overlooked contributions of Latinos in this country, Juan?\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, I think that the - I attempt to document the enormous contributions that people are not aware of, the early contributions, because Latinos are not only some of the newest immigrants, they're some of the oldest residents of the country, if you go to South Texas or northern New Mexico, southern Colorado, where Mexicans go back long before those territories became part of the United States. You'll remember, the entire Southwest was originally Mexican territory and provided enormous wealth to the country. The gold and silver mining industry of California and Nevada, the sheepherding industry of New Mexico, the copper industry of Arizona, and the entire cattle industry of the United States had its origins in Texas, in South Texas. These were all Mexican territories. Much of the labor was Mexican labor that produced these industries. So there's an enormous contribution to the wealth and prosperity that can be traced back to Latinos of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Juan, I'm glad you're with us tomorrow co-hosting, because...part two.

The book by Jeanine Cummins tells the story of a Mexican mother and her son fleeing cartel violence. Before its release, it was heralded as the next great American novel, and Flatiron Books paid Cummins, who is not Mexican, a seven-figure advance. But a slew of Latino writers say the book is a poorly researched caricature of Mexico and have slammed the publishing industry for ignoring Latino writers who are telling their own stories of migration and displacement. This is author and writer Myriam Gurba speaking with Maria Hinojosa on NPR about reading \"American Dirt\" while in Mexico.\n\nMyriam Gurba : \"It felt insulting that I am in a country with a tremendous cultural history and a tremendous literary history, and I'm reading a book with an introductory letter from a publisher that argues that this author is going to give a face to the faceless. And I'm looking around at my Mexican family, and we all have faces. And faces and voices matter in my family.\"\n\nThe book's critics also say \"American Dirt\" completely erases Central Americans, who actually make up the largest number of asylum seekers currently fleeing to the U.S.-Mexico border. Myriam Gurba and other Latino writers have launched a campaign called #DignidadLiteraria - or \"Literary Dignity\" - in order to promote Latino writers."

The month began as a week in 1968. This year, it coincides with the growing crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border. Thousands arrive daily seeking asylum but find instead razor wire, hostility and arrest. This flood of humanity is what Democracy Now! news hour co-host Juan Gonzalez calls \"The Harvest of Empire,\" the title of his seminal history of Latinos in America, as the consequences of colonial interventions abroad by the U.S. government create conditions in impacted countries that residents simply cannot endure.\n\nOn the day before this year's Hispanic Heritage Month began, a federal judge in Austin, Texas ordered Texas to remove a thousand-foot floating barrier in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass. The barrier, with large orange buoys strung together, separated by serrated saw blades, is the latest and perhaps most grotesque symbol of the anti-immigrant movement in the United States. Texas appealed the ruling, and a federal appeals court stayed the order as the case proceeds, allowing the barrier to remain in place. In early August, a body was found entangled in the barrier. Last week, the bodies of two drowning victims, an adult and a three-year-old child, were recovered nearby as well.\n\nMost migrants face months of dangerous travel before even getting to the Rio Grande river crossing. \"We want to cross into the United States for a better future. The journey has been very difficult. We have been mistreated. We have been hungry. We have suffered. The children are tired,\" Makel Alexander, a Venezuelan migrant, told Reuters near the border. \"We will cross the border so that we can do well, because our country is struggling.\"\n\nMakel's story is repeated, day after day, as millions in the Western Hemisphere flee increasingly dangerous and desperate situations in their home countries.\n\n\"The historic interventions, the military interventions, the sanctions that we've imposed on different countries in Central America, in the Caribbean, in South America, and, of course, the failed war on drugs are all important factors that are displacing people, creating misery and responsible for much of the violence, corruption and impunity in Central America, increasingly in places like South America, like Venezuela,\" Democratic Congressmember Jésus \"Chuy\" Garcia said on Democracy Now! \"That is at the root of what is driving people to desperation. They're coming to the U.S. seeking asylum and refuge, fleeing terrible consequences, risking their lives to get here.\"\n\nGarcia, the first Mexican-born U.S. Congressmember from the Midwest, has requested more federal assistance for Chicago as thousands of migrants arrive there - many bussed by Republicans like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in cynical and potentially illegal political stunts.\n\nThe ongoing influx of migrants, as Rep. Chuy Garcia said, has deep roots in U.S. government interventions over many decades, including military interventions in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Panama, Grenada, the U.S.-backed 1954 coup against the democratically-elected president of Guatemala and the ensuing U.S. support for murderous militaries and paramilitaries in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua in the 1980s. Crushing economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Cuba and Venezuela echo the dictate issued by President Nixon to the CIA in 1970, launching the plan to overthrow Pres. Salvador Allende in Chile, to \"make the economy scream.\"\n\nLatinos have played a central role in U.S. history, yet this rich history is under attack, as rightwing interests have derailed a Smithsonian Institution exhibit on their role in the civil rights movement, being developed for the planned National Museum of the American Latino.\n\n\"Our major concern was to just make sure that we were telling a truthful story, a complex story and a nuanced story about how Latinos have grappled with their relationship to the United States,\" Felipe Hinojosa, a Baylor University history professor and one of the curators of the paused exhibit, explained on Democracy Now! \"The larger and broader questions of who we are as a community and what is our relationship to the nation were central questions for Latino civil rights activists in the 1960s and 1970s.\"\n\nThe civil rights exhibit has been replaced by one focusing on salsa music.\n\nInstead of these complex narratives, we see a rising movement to erase history and supplant it with xenophobic soundbites. This dog-whistle racism, buttressed by razor-barbed buoys along the border, represents a dark and dangerous turn in our nation's history. Let's make Hispanic Heritage Month a time to celebrate diversity and to overcome the legacy of racism in the United States.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the violence engulfing Latinos is part of a backlash over the immigration debate in this country. We speak with Mark Potok of the SPLC . [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : New FBI statistics suggest anti-Latino hate crimes have risen by almost 35% since 2003. In California, the state with the largest number of Latinos, the number of hate crimes against Latinos have almost doubled. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the violence engulfing Latinos is part of a backlash over the immigration debate in this country. For years, the Southern Poverty Law Center has been tracking examples of physical and psychological violence waged against Latinos. Mark Potok joins us now from Montgomery, Alabama, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly Intelligence Report, which monitors hate groups in the US. Thanks for joining us, Mark. What have you found? MARK POTOK : Thanks for having me, Amy. Well, basically, it's an anecdotal report. The FBI statistics, like all hate crimes statistics, are extremely shaky. But the direction that things are going in is obvious. I mean, what we did was essentially compile a list of horrors, stories about, you know, a teenager in Houston being sodomized with an umbrella patio pole in an anti-immigrant attack; you know, a kid attacked at a fair by the Klan in Kentucky; you know, another teenager, a Latino teen, chased around a room in Long Island by neo-Nazis with a running chainsaw, saying, you know, \"This is how you run for the border.\" And these crimes also include a great many people who aren't affiliated with any kind of hate group or anything like that. So, really, the point of our report, really, the cover story in our forthcoming Intelligence Report, is that the country seems to be awash in these kinds of crimes. And I would say, beyond that, that these crimes, I think, are clearly the outcome of the kind of rancid political debate that you've been talking about on your show and in fact were talking about with Lou Dobbs yesterday. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I actually wanted to turn to an excerpt of the conversation that we had yesterday with CNN anchor Lou Dobbs. During yesterday's broadcast, we played this report from Lou Dobbs's show, Lou Dobbs Tonight , about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's May 2006 visit to the United States. CASEY WIAN : This Mexican military incursion was fully authorized: a Mexican air force jet carrying President Vicente Fox, who was not just invited to Utah, but encouraged to visit by Governor John Huntsman. PRESIDENT VICENTE FOX : We fully support the businessmen from Utah and Mexico... CASEY WIAN : It's estimated Utah has about 100,000 illegal aliens, and the number is growing rapidly. Utah is also a part of the territory some militant Latino activists refer to as Aztlan, the portion of the Southwest United States they claim rightfully belongs to Mexico. You could call this the Vicente Fox Aztlan tour, since the three states he'll visit-Utah, Washington, and California-are all part of some radical group's vision of the mythical indigenous homeland, Lou. LOU DOBBS : Casey, thank you very much. AMY GOODMAN : After we played this clip for Lou Dobbs, we pointed out the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized CNN for airing that report, in part because it featured a map of the United States highlighting the seven Southwestern states that Mexico supposedly covets and calls Aztlan. The map was prominently sourced to the Council of Conservative Citizens, which is considered by many to be a white supremacist hate group. We asked Lou Dobbs for his response. LOU DOBBS : I mean, we weren't hiding anything. We had no idea what they were. The field producer who used it went on the web, pulled-did a \"grab,\" as it's called, and put it up. And she was suspended for a day for doing so. Did you guys know that we have sent our producers and our reporters down to the Southern Poverty Law Center years ago to make certain this sort of thing doesn't happen? That's how seriously we take the issue. And for you to talk about the incursion, you forgot to point out that that was coming out of rather jocular discussion of the incursions by Mexican forces along the border and the response of the US government. JUAN GONZALEZ : But- LOU DOBBS : And, I mean, are you offended? AMY GOODMAN : Lou, did you say you have no idea what the Council of Conservative Citizens is? LOU DOBBS : Did I say I don't? AMY GOODMAN : Yes. LOU DOBBS : I certainly do now. Absolutely. What did I-you didn't hear what I just said? AMY GOODMAN : I just want to- LOU DOBBS : They're acknowledged as a hate group. Absolutely. JUAN GONZALEZ : See, but the problem, this- LOU DOBBS : What is the problem here? JUAN GONZALEZ : Projecting the image to your viewers that there's a Mexican desire to reconquer, the Reconquista of the Southwestern United States, does create images-and especially in people who are not necessarily as intelligent as you necessarily or who have studied as much as you have- LOU DOBBS : Thank you for conceding that. JUAN GONZALEZ : -that the country is under siege. LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government? You don't think people have a sense of humor about that? The reality is, I think most people do. The other thing is, who are you trying to protect America from? I'm a little confused, because the reality is that there is a strong radical group of Reconquistas and Aztlan aficionados, and I have had them demonstrating against me in a couple of cities over the past few weeks. Don't sit here being disingenuous- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not. LOU DOBBS : -and sanctimonious, because, let me tell you something- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not being disingenuous. LOU DOBBS : -there are many idiots on either extreme of this debate, and don't kid yourself- AMY GOODMAN : But, Lou, I think what's important here- LOU DOBBS : -and you know it. AMY GOODMAN : -once again, is the pattern. It's the pattern- LOU DOBBS : The pattern-come on, please. AMY GOODMAN : No, let me make my point, because what I talk about is facts. LOU DOBBS : OK, let's look at the pattern. The pattern is, for five years, we've been reporting on illegal immigration. The pattern is that we have been reporting on the impact of illegal immigration. It doesn't suit your partisan views-and that's understandable-or your ideological views. But don't get carried away with yourselves, for crying out loud! AMY GOODMAN : OK, Lou, let's talk about some of the guests you've had on your show. LOU DOBBS : Sure. AMY GOODMAN : For example, Barbara Coe, leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform,- LOU DOBBS : She's not a guest. You're reading from the Southern Poverty Law Center- AMY GOODMAN : -quoted-just one second- LOU DOBBS : She was not a guest. AMY GOODMAN : I am going to look at the-as you said, you actually felt that the Southern Poverty Law Center was so important- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -in getting information- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -that you sent your producers down there to get information so that you wouldn't represent hate groups on the air. LOU DOBBS : In their responses, they're nothing but a fundraising organization- AMY GOODMAN : So let me- LOU DOBBS : -and they're indulging in pure BS. AMY GOODMAN : OK. Now, let me just- LOU DOBBS : And so are you, when you quote them. AMY GOODMAN : That was Lou Dobbs on our broadcast yesterday. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, your response? MARK POTOK : Well, I mean, I guess I find it amusing that Lou first cites us as an authority to show that he looks into the allegations of racism seriously and then says we're nothing but a fundraising operation that cranks out a lot of \"BS,\" as he says. He has also called us, on the air, a fascist organization for what we've said about this. Look, I mean, the real point is the point you made: this is a part of a pattern. It's not that his producer happened to accidentally grab this particular graphic; it's what that represents, that Dobbs is really pushing these completely bogus ideas, racist conspiracy theories. It's worth saying that in addition to the Reconquista theory, the Aztlan theory, he has pushed very heavily the idea that there is a North American Union, an entity which is planned by Bush and other neoconservatives, which would merge the countries of Canada, Mexico and the United States. He has pushed this on his website, with polls asking people are they concerned. He has mentioned it repeatedly on the air. At this point, eighteen state legislatures have passed resolutions condemning the so-called North American Union. One small problem: there is no such thing. This is a figment of the imaginations of people on the radical right. The theory essentially comes from the John Birch Society and related kinds of organizations. You know, it's utterly bogus. But it's the same idea as the Aztlan theory. The Mexicans, the Canadians, in this case, are out to do us in. AMY GOODMAN : And how the Minutemen tie into this, if they do, Mark Potok? MARK POTOK : Well, the Minutemen, in a lot of ways, and the vigilante groups, in general, have been transmitters of theories like this. You know, the Aztlan theory, for instance, was pushed very heavily early on by a hate group called American Border Patrol. This idea that Mexico and native-born Chicanos in the United States were involved together in this plot then made its way out into the Minutemen groups and eventually landed on Lou Dobbs, on any number of AM radio shows. It's been talked about by US congressmen. And so, it's become a part of this debate, and yet it has nothing to do with what's actually going on. And this is really the point we've tried to make with Dobbs, is that, you know, you are not contributing in any way; you are detracting from any kind of democratic discussion of immigration. I think it's obvious that immigration is not only an issue, but a problem, something that must be dealt with, that, you know, people in a democracy have every right to debate. But when the debate becomes about, you know, they are bringing leprosy, they are coming here to rape our children, they are destroying the economy, they're wrecking the culture, they're more loyal to the Catholic Church than they are to our government, and so on, one is poisoning the debate. AMY GOODMAN : Mark Potok, I want to thank you for being with us, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly Intelligence Report, which focuses on far-right hate groups in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the violence engulfing Latinos is part of a backlash over the immigration debate in this country.

LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government? You don't think people have a sense of humor about that? The reality is, I think most people do. The other thing is, who are you trying to protect America from? I'm a little confused, because the reality is that there is a strong radical group of Reconquistas and Aztlan aficionados, and I have had them demonstrating against me in a couple of cities over the past few weeks. Don't sit here being disingenuous- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not. LOU DOBBS : -and sanctimonious, because, let me tell you something- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not being disingenuous. LOU DOBBS : -there are many idiots on either extreme of this debate, and don't kid yourself- AMY GOODMAN : But, Lou, I think what's important here- LOU DOBBS : -and you know it. AMY GOODMAN : -once again, is the pattern. It's the pattern- LOU DOBBS : The pattern-come on, please. AMY GOODMAN : No, let me make my point, because what I talk about is facts. LOU DOBBS : OK, let's look at the pattern. The pattern is, for five years, we've been reporting on illegal immigration. The pattern is that we have been reporting on the impact of illegal immigration. It doesn't suit your partisan views-and that's understandable-or your ideological views. But don't get carried away with yourselves, for crying out loud! AMY GOODMAN : OK, Lou, let's talk about some of the guests you've had on your show. LOU DOBBS : Sure. AMY GOODMAN : For example, Barbara Coe, leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform,- LOU DOBBS : She's not a guest. You're reading from the Southern Poverty Law Center- AMY GOODMAN : -quoted-just one second- LOU DOBBS : She was not a guest. AMY GOODMAN : I am going to look at the-as you said, you actually felt that the Southern Poverty Law Center was so important- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -in getting information- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -that you sent your producers down there to get information so that you wouldn't represent hate groups on the air. LOU DOBBS : In their responses, they're nothing but a fundraising organization- AMY GOODMAN : So let me- LOU DOBBS : -and they're indulging in pure BS. AMY GOODMAN : OK. Now, let me just- LOU DOBBS : And so are you, when you quote them. AMY GOODMAN : That was Lou Dobbs on our broadcast yesterday. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, your response? MARK POTOK : Well, I mean, I guess I find it amusing that Lou first cites us as an authority to show that he looks into the allegations of racism seriously and then says we're nothing but a fundraising operation that cranks out a lot of \"BS,\" as he says. He has also called us, on the air, a fascist organization for what we've said about this. Look, I mean, the real point is the point you made: this is a part of a pattern. It's not that his producer happened to accidentally grab this particular graphic; it's what that represents, that Dobbs is really pushing these completely bogus ideas, racist conspiracy theories. It's worth saying that in addition to the Reconquista theory, the Aztlan theory, he has pushed very heavily the idea that there is a North American Union, an entity which is planned by Bush and other neoconservatives, which would merge the countries of Canada, Mexico and the United States. He has pushed this on his website, with polls asking people are they concerned. He has mentioned it repeatedly on the air. At this point, eighteen state legislatures have passed resolutions condemning the so-called North American Union. One small problem: there is no such thing. This is a figment of the imaginations of people on the radical right. The theory essentially comes from the John Birch Society and related kinds of organizations. You know, it's utterly bogus. But it's the same idea as the Aztlan theory. The Mexicans, the Canadians, in this case, are out to do us in. AMY GOODMAN : And how the Minutemen tie into this, if they do, Mark Potok? MARK POTOK : Well, the Minutemen, in a lot of ways, and the vigilante groups, in general, have been transmitters of theories like this. You know, the Aztlan theory, for instance, was pushed very heavily early on by a hate group called American Border Patrol. This idea that Mexico and native-born Chicanos in the United States were involved together in this plot then made its way out into the Minutemen groups and eventually landed on Lou Dobbs, on any number of AM radio shows. It's been talked about by US congressmen. And so, it's become a part of this debate, and yet it has nothing to do with what's actually going on. And this is really the point we've tried to make with Dobbs, is that, you know, you are not contributing in any way; you are detracting from any kind of democratic discussion of immigration. I think it's obvious that immigration is not only an issue, but a problem, something that must be dealt with, that, you know, people in a democracy have every right to debate. But when the debate becomes about, you know, they are bringing leprosy, they are coming here to rape our children, they are destroying the economy, they're wrecking the culture, they're more loyal to the Catholic Church than they are to our government, and so on, one is poisoning the debate. AMY GOODMAN : Mark Potok, I want to thank you for being with us, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly Intelligence Report, which focuses on far-right hate groups in the United States.\n\nThanks for joining us, Mark. What have you found? MARK POTOK : Thanks for having me, Amy. Well, basically, it's an anecdotal report. The FBI statistics, like all hate crimes statistics, are extremely shaky. But the direction that things are going in is obvious. I mean, what we did was essentially compile a list of horrors, stories about, you know, a teenager in Houston being sodomized with an umbrella patio pole in an anti-immigrant attack; you know, a kid attacked at a fair by the Klan in Kentucky; you know, another teenager, a Latino teen, chased around a room in Long Island by neo-Nazis with a running chainsaw, saying, you know, \"This is how you run for the border.\" And these crimes also include a great many people who aren't affiliated with any kind of hate group or anything like that. So, really, the point of our report, really, the cover story in our forthcoming Intelligence Report, is that the country seems to be awash in these kinds of crimes. And I would say, beyond that, that these crimes, I think, are clearly the outcome of the kind of rancid political debate that you've been talking about on your show and in fact were talking about with Lou Dobbs yesterday. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I actually wanted to turn to an excerpt of the conversation that we had yesterday with CNN anchor Lou Dobbs. During yesterday's broadcast, we played this report from Lou Dobbs's show, Lou Dobbs Tonight , about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's May 2006 visit to the United States. CASEY WIAN : This Mexican military incursion was fully authorized: a Mexican air force jet carrying President Vicente Fox, who was not just invited to Utah, but encouraged to visit by Governor John Huntsman. PRESIDENT VICENTE FOX : We fully support the businessmen from Utah and Mexico... CASEY WIAN : It's estimated Utah has about 100,000 illegal aliens, and the number is growing rapidly. Utah is also a part of the territory some militant Latino activists refer to as Aztlan, the portion of the Southwest United States they claim rightfully belongs to Mexico. You could call this the Vicente Fox Aztlan tour, since the three states he'll visit-Utah, Washington, and California-are all part of some radical group's vision of the mythical indigenous homeland, Lou. LOU DOBBS : Casey, thank you very much. AMY GOODMAN : After we played this clip for Lou Dobbs, we pointed out the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized CNN for airing that report, in part because it featured a map of the United States highlighting the seven Southwestern states that Mexico supposedly covets and calls Aztlan. The map was prominently sourced to the Council of Conservative Citizens, which is considered by many to be a white supremacist hate group. We asked Lou Dobbs for his response. LOU DOBBS : I mean, we weren't hiding anything. We had no idea what they were. The field producer who used it went on the web, pulled-did a \"grab,\" as it's called, and put it up. And she was suspended for a day for doing so. Did you guys know that we have sent our producers and our reporters down to the Southern Poverty Law Center years ago to make certain this sort of thing doesn't happen? That's how seriously we take the issue. And for you to talk about the incursion, you forgot to point out that that was coming out of rather jocular discussion of the incursions by Mexican forces along the border and the response of the US government. JUAN GONZALEZ : But- LOU DOBBS : And, I mean, are you offended? AMY GOODMAN : Lou, did you say you have no idea what the Council of Conservative Citizens is? LOU DOBBS : Did I say I don't? AMY GOODMAN : Yes. LOU DOBBS : I certainly do now. Absolutely. What did I-you didn't hear what I just said? AMY GOODMAN : I just want to- LOU DOBBS : They're acknowledged as a hate group. Absolutely. JUAN GONZALEZ : See, but the problem, this- LOU DOBBS : What is the problem here? JUAN GONZALEZ : Projecting the image to your viewers that there's a Mexican desire to reconquer, the Reconquista of the Southwestern United States, does create images-and especially in people who are not necessarily as intelligent as you necessarily or who have studied as much as you have- LOU DOBBS : Thank you for conceding that. JUAN GONZALEZ : -that the country is under siege. LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government?

This is a figment of the imaginations of people on the radical right. The theory essentially comes from the John Birch Society and related kinds of organizations. You know, it's utterly bogus. But it's the same idea as the Aztlan theory. The Mexicans, the Canadians, in this case, are out to do us in. AMY GOODMAN : And how the Minutemen tie into this, if they do, Mark Potok? MARK POTOK : Well, the Minutemen, in a lot of ways, and the vigilante groups, in general, have been transmitters of theories like this. You know, the Aztlan theory, for instance, was pushed very heavily early on by a hate group called American Border Patrol. This idea that Mexico and native-born Chicanos in the United States were involved together in this plot then made its way out into the Minutemen groups and eventually landed on Lou Dobbs, on any number of AM radio shows. It's been talked about by US congressmen. And so, it's become a part of this debate, and yet it has nothing to do with what's actually going on. And this is really the point we've tried to make with Dobbs, is that, you know, you are not contributing in any way; you are detracting from any kind of democratic discussion of immigration. I think it's obvious that immigration is not only an issue, but a problem, something that must be dealt with, that, you know, people in a democracy have every right to debate. But when the debate becomes about, you know, they are bringing leprosy, they are coming here to rape our children, they are destroying the economy, they're wrecking the culture, they're more loyal to the Catholic Church than they are to our government, and so on, one is poisoning the debate. AMY GOODMAN : Mark Potok, I want to thank you for being with us, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly Intelligence Report, which focuses on far-right hate groups in the United States.\n\nSo, really, the point of our report, really, the cover story in our forthcoming Intelligence Report, is that the country seems to be awash in these kinds of crimes. And I would say, beyond that, that these crimes, I think, are clearly the outcome of the kind of rancid political debate that you've been talking about on your show and in fact were talking about with Lou Dobbs yesterday. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I actually wanted to turn to an excerpt of the conversation that we had yesterday with CNN anchor Lou Dobbs. During yesterday's broadcast, we played this report from Lou Dobbs's show, Lou Dobbs Tonight , about former Mexican President Vicente Fox's May 2006 visit to the United States. CASEY WIAN : This Mexican military incursion was fully authorized: a Mexican air force jet carrying President Vicente Fox, who was not just invited to Utah, but encouraged to visit by Governor John Huntsman. PRESIDENT VICENTE FOX : We fully support the businessmen from Utah and Mexico... CASEY WIAN : It's estimated Utah has about 100,000 illegal aliens, and the number is growing rapidly. Utah is also a part of the territory some militant Latino activists refer to as Aztlan, the portion of the Southwest United States they claim rightfully belongs to Mexico. You could call this the Vicente Fox Aztlan tour, since the three states he'll visit-Utah, Washington, and California-are all part of some radical group's vision of the mythical indigenous homeland, Lou. LOU DOBBS : Casey, thank you very much. AMY GOODMAN : After we played this clip for Lou Dobbs, we pointed out the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized CNN for airing that report, in part because it featured a map of the United States highlighting the seven Southwestern states that Mexico supposedly covets and calls Aztlan. The map was prominently sourced to the Council of Conservative Citizens, which is considered by many to be a white supremacist hate group. We asked Lou Dobbs for his response. LOU DOBBS : I mean, we weren't hiding anything. We had no idea what they were. The field producer who used it went on the web, pulled-did a \"grab,\" as it's called, and put it up. And she was suspended for a day for doing so. Did you guys know that we have sent our producers and our reporters down to the Southern Poverty Law Center years ago to make certain this sort of thing doesn't happen? That's how seriously we take the issue. And for you to talk about the incursion, you forgot to point out that that was coming out of rather jocular discussion of the incursions by Mexican forces along the border and the response of the US government. JUAN GONZALEZ : But- LOU DOBBS : And, I mean, are you offended? AMY GOODMAN : Lou, did you say you have no idea what the Council of Conservative Citizens is? LOU DOBBS : Did I say I don't? AMY GOODMAN : Yes. LOU DOBBS : I certainly do now. Absolutely. What did I-you didn't hear what I just said? AMY GOODMAN : I just want to- LOU DOBBS : They're acknowledged as a hate group. Absolutely. JUAN GONZALEZ : See, but the problem, this- LOU DOBBS : What is the problem here? JUAN GONZALEZ : Projecting the image to your viewers that there's a Mexican desire to reconquer, the Reconquista of the Southwestern United States, does create images-and especially in people who are not necessarily as intelligent as you necessarily or who have studied as much as you have- LOU DOBBS : Thank you for conceding that. JUAN GONZALEZ : -that the country is under siege. LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government? You don't think people have a sense of humor about that? The reality is, I think most people do. The other thing is, who are you trying to protect America from? I'm a little confused, because the reality is that there is a strong radical group of Reconquistas and Aztlan aficionados, and I have had them demonstrating against me in a couple of cities over the past few weeks. Don't sit here being disingenuous- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not. LOU DOBBS : -and sanctimonious, because, let me tell you something- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not being disingenuous. LOU DOBBS : -there are many idiots on either extreme of this debate, and don't kid yourself- AMY GOODMAN : But, Lou, I think what's important here- LOU DOBBS : -and you know it. AMY GOODMAN : -once again, is the pattern. It's the pattern- LOU DOBBS : The pattern-come on, please. AMY GOODMAN : No, let me make my point, because what I talk about is facts. LOU DOBBS : OK, let's look at the pattern. The pattern is, for five years, we've been reporting on illegal immigration. The pattern is that we have been reporting on the impact of illegal immigration. It doesn't suit your partisan views-and that's understandable-or your ideological views. But don't get carried away with yourselves, for crying out loud! AMY GOODMAN : OK, Lou, let's talk about some of the guests you've had on your show. LOU DOBBS : Sure. AMY GOODMAN : For example, Barbara Coe, leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform,- LOU DOBBS : She's not a guest. You're reading from the Southern Poverty Law Center- AMY GOODMAN : -quoted-just one second- LOU DOBBS : She was not a guest. AMY GOODMAN : I am going to look at the-as you said, you actually felt that the Southern Poverty Law Center was so important- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -in getting information- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -that you sent your producers down there to get information so that you wouldn't represent hate groups on the air. LOU DOBBS : In their responses, they're nothing but a fundraising organization- AMY GOODMAN : So let me- LOU DOBBS : -and they're indulging in pure BS. AMY GOODMAN : OK. Now, let me just- LOU DOBBS : And so are you, when you quote them. AMY GOODMAN : That was Lou Dobbs on our broadcast yesterday. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, your response? MARK POTOK : Well, I mean, I guess I find it amusing that Lou first cites us as an authority to show that he looks into the allegations of racism seriously and then says we're nothing but a fundraising operation that cranks out a lot of \"BS,\" as he says. He has also called us, on the air, a fascist organization for what we've said about this. Look, I mean, the real point is the point you made: this is a part of a pattern. It's not that his producer happened to accidentally grab this particular graphic; it's what that represents, that Dobbs is really pushing these completely bogus ideas, racist conspiracy theories. It's worth saying that in addition to the Reconquista theory, the Aztlan theory, he has pushed very heavily the idea that there is a North American Union, an entity which is planned by Bush and other neoconservatives, which would merge the countries of Canada, Mexico and the United States. He has pushed this on his website, with polls asking people are they concerned. He has mentioned it repeatedly on the air. At this point, eighteen state legislatures have passed resolutions condemning the so-called North American Union. One small problem: there is no such thing. This is a figment of the imaginations of people on the radical right. The theory essentially comes from the John Birch Society and related kinds of organizations. You know, it's utterly bogus. But it's the same idea as the Aztlan theory. The Mexicans, the Canadians, in this case, are out to do us in. AMY GOODMAN : And how the Minutemen tie into this, if they do, Mark Potok?

AMY GOODMAN : -in getting information- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -that you sent your producers down there to get information so that you wouldn't represent hate groups on the air. LOU DOBBS : In their responses, they're nothing but a fundraising organization- AMY GOODMAN : So let me- LOU DOBBS : -and they're indulging in pure BS. AMY GOODMAN : OK. Now, let me just- LOU DOBBS : And so are you, when you quote them.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : But- LOU DOBBS : And, I mean, are you offended? AMY GOODMAN : Lou, did you say you have no idea what the Council of Conservative Citizens is? LOU DOBBS : Did I say I don't? AMY GOODMAN : Yes. LOU DOBBS : I certainly do now. Absolutely. What did I-you didn't hear what I just said? AMY GOODMAN : I just want to- LOU DOBBS : They're acknowledged as a hate group. Absolutely. JUAN GONZALEZ : See, but the problem, this- LOU DOBBS : What is the problem here? JUAN GONZALEZ : Projecting the image to your viewers that there's a Mexican desire to reconquer, the Reconquista of the Southwestern United States, does create images-and especially in people who are not necessarily as intelligent as you necessarily or who have studied as much as you have- LOU DOBBS : Thank you for conceding that. JUAN GONZALEZ : -that the country is under siege. LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government? You don't think people have a sense of humor about that? The reality is, I think most people do. The other thing is, who are you trying to protect America from? I'm a little confused, because the reality is that there is a strong radical group of Reconquistas and Aztlan aficionados, and I have had them demonstrating against me in a couple of cities over the past few weeks. Don't sit here being disingenuous- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not. LOU DOBBS : -and sanctimonious, because, let me tell you something- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not being disingenuous. LOU DOBBS : -there are many idiots on either extreme of this debate, and don't kid yourself- AMY GOODMAN : But, Lou, I think what's important here- LOU DOBBS : -and you know it. AMY GOODMAN : -once again, is the pattern. It's the pattern- LOU DOBBS : The pattern-come on, please. AMY GOODMAN : No, let me make my point, because what I talk about is facts. LOU DOBBS : OK, let's look at the pattern. The pattern is, for five years, we've been reporting on illegal immigration. The pattern is that we have been reporting on the impact of illegal immigration. It doesn't suit your partisan views-and that's understandable-or your ideological views. But don't get carried away with yourselves, for crying out loud! AMY GOODMAN : OK, Lou, let's talk about some of the guests you've had on your show. LOU DOBBS : Sure.

You're reading from the Southern Poverty Law Center- AMY GOODMAN : -quoted-just one second- LOU DOBBS : She was not a guest. AMY GOODMAN : I am going to look at the-as you said, you actually felt that the Southern Poverty Law Center was so important- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -in getting information- LOU DOBBS : It's a joke. AMY GOODMAN : -that you sent your producers down there to get information so that you wouldn't represent hate groups on the air. LOU DOBBS : In their responses, they're nothing but a fundraising organization- AMY GOODMAN : So let me- LOU DOBBS : -and they're indulging in pure BS. AMY GOODMAN : OK. Now, let me just- LOU DOBBS : And so are you, when you quote them.\n\nWhat is the problem here?\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Projecting the image to your viewers that there's a Mexican desire to reconquer, the Reconquista of the Southwestern United States, does create images-and especially in people who are not necessarily as intelligent as you necessarily or who have studied as much as you have- LOU DOBBS : Thank you for conceding that. JUAN GONZALEZ : -that the country is under siege. LOU DOBBS : My god, are you so self-important that you don't think people have a sense of humor when Casey Wian says this is an authorized incursion by the Mexican government? You don't think people have a sense of humor about that? The reality is, I think most people do. The other thing is, who are you trying to protect America from? I'm a little confused, because the reality is that there is a strong radical group of Reconquistas and Aztlan aficionados, and I have had them demonstrating against me in a couple of cities over the past few weeks. Don't sit here being disingenuous- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not. LOU DOBBS : -and sanctimonious, because, let me tell you something- JUAN GONZALEZ : I'm not being disingenuous. LOU DOBBS : -there are many idiots on either extreme of this debate, and don't kid yourself- AMY GOODMAN : But, Lou, I think what's important here- LOU DOBBS : -and you know it. AMY GOODMAN : -once again, is the pattern. It's the pattern- LOU DOBBS : The pattern-come on, please. AMY GOODMAN : No, let me make my point, because what I talk about is facts. LOU DOBBS : OK, let's look at the pattern. The pattern is, for five years, we've been reporting on illegal immigration. The pattern is that we have been reporting on the impact of illegal immigration. It doesn't suit your partisan views-and that's understandable-or your ideological views.

Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, your response? MARK POTOK : Well, I mean, I guess I find it amusing that Lou first cites us as an authority to show that he looks into the allegations of racism seriously and then says we're nothing but a fundraising operation that cranks out a lot of \"BS,\" as he says. He has also called us, on the air, a fascist organization for what we've said about this. Look, I mean, the real point is the point you made: this is a part of a pattern. It's not that his producer happened to accidentally grab this particular graphic; it's what that represents, that Dobbs is really pushing these completely bogus ideas, racist conspiracy theories. It's worth saying that in addition to the Reconquista theory, the Aztlan theory, he has pushed very heavily the idea that there is a North American Union, an entity which is planned by Bush and other neoconservatives, which would merge the countries of Canada, Mexico and the United States. He has pushed this on his website, with polls asking people are they concerned. He has mentioned it repeatedly on the air. At this point, eighteen state legislatures have passed resolutions condemning the so-called North American Union. One small problem: there is no such thing. This is a figment of the imaginations of people on the radical right. The theory essentially comes from the John Birch Society and related kinds of organizations. You know, it's utterly bogus. But it's the same idea as the Aztlan theory. The Mexicans, the Canadians, in this case, are out to do us in. AMY GOODMAN : And how the Minutemen tie into this, if they do, Mark Potok? MARK POTOK : Well, the Minutemen, in a lot of ways, and the vigilante groups, in general, have been transmitters of theories like this. You know, the Aztlan theory, for instance, was pushed very heavily early on by a hate group called American Border Patrol. This idea that Mexico and native-born Chicanos in the United States were involved together in this plot then made its way out into the Minutemen groups and eventually landed on Lou Dobbs, on any number of AM radio shows. It's been talked about by US congressmen. And so, it's become a part of this debate, and yet it has nothing to do with what's actually going on. And this is really the point we've tried to make with Dobbs, is that, you know, you are not contributing in any way; you are detracting from any kind of democratic discussion of immigration. I think it's obvious that immigration is not only an issue, but a problem, something that must be dealt with, that, you know, people in a democracy have every right to debate. But when the debate becomes about, you know, they are bringing leprosy, they are coming here to rape our children, they are destroying the economy, they're wrecking the culture, they're more loyal to the Catholic Church than they are to our government, and so on, one is poisoning the debate. AMY GOODMAN : Mark Potok, I want to thank you for being with us, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly Intelligence Report, which focuses on far-right hate groups in the United States.\n\nMARK POTOK : Well, I mean, I guess I find it amusing that Lou first cites us as an authority to show that he looks into the allegations of racism seriously and then says we're nothing but a fundraising operation that cranks out a lot of \"BS,\" as he says.

Dodge City, Kansas, is 60 percent Hispanic, but the Associated Press reports that Hispanic turnout was just 17 percent in Ford County, where Dodge City is located, compared to 61 percent turnout for white voters in 2014. The ACLU reports that the city's lone polling site services more than 13,000 voters, compared to an average of 1,200 voters per polling site at other locations. We are joined by Johnny Dunlap, chair of the Ford County Democratic Party.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, in Kansas, local officials are under fire for moving a majority-Latino city's single polling site outside of the city limits, more than a mile from the nearest bus stop. Dodge City, Kansas, is nearly 60 percent Hispanic, but the Associated Press reports that Hispanic turnout in the county where Dodge City is located was just 17 percent, compared to 61 percent turnout for white voters, in 2014.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The ACLU reports Dodge's lone polling site services more than 13,000 voters, compared to an average of 1,200 voters per polling site in other locations.\n\nWe're joined now by Johnny Dunlap with the Kansas Democratic Party. He'a joining us from Dodge City.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Tell us what happened.\n\nJOHNNY DUNLAP : Well, so this is really one more thing in a larger, longer problem. Way back in 2002, the county clerk went down to just one polling place for Dodge City, Kansas, and it's been that way since. And that one polling place was in the more affluent, white part of town. Dodge City is pretty clearly divided between like a white northern part of town and a Hispanic southern part of town. So, this move of the polling location is really just taking an already bad situation and making it worse, because it's moved the polling location outside of town so it's convenient for no one. And when you combine that with a historic turnout of 17 percent for the Hispanic population, a 61 percent turnout for the white population, and then you look at our elected officials, every seat we have, except for the county commission, is at large, so our city commission, our school board, our community college board of trustees-every one one of those offices are currently held by a white person, even though the town is 60 percent Hispanic. So, this move is just-like I said, it's just one more thing in an ongoing problem.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Johnny Dunlap, I'd like to ask you, because most people are not aware that a place, an iconic place like Dodge City, famed in the westward movement of Americans, is-has such a high Latino population, but it's not the only place in the Midwest. Throughout Iowa and Kansas and Nebraska, there's been a huge surge in the last 20 years or so of Latino populations, mostly as a result of the importation of Mexican labor for the meatpacking industry. Could you talk about that?\n\nJOHNNY DUNLAP : Sure. So, in Dodge City specifically, that influx began in the late '70s, early 1980s. There are now two large beef packing plants in Dodge City. It's one of the cornerstones of our economy around here. And those beef packing plants have historically recruited folks from points south to come here and live and work. And so, what we have now is second-, third-generation Americans who have only ever voted in one polling place and don't know that it could be better.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what's the reason that the city clerk gives for the lone polling place? Forget about the fact that it's already overburdened, given the voting population, but then moving it outside of the city limits to a place where you can't even get there by public transportation?\n\nJOHNNY DUNLAP : Well, so, it's the county clerk. The county clerk, I met with her in May, late May, to ask her to increase the number of polling places. And this is not the first time I've met with our county clerk-and her predecessor, I met with several times-in an effort to convince them to have more polling places. And the excuses that she gives for only having one polling place, frankly, don't hold water. I mean, one of them is she said, \"Well, it would increase costs to have more polling places, and it's just not in my budget.\" Well, the thing is, she writes her own budget. So, if something is not in her budget, it's because she didn't put it in her budget. And then she complains about the number of voting machines that she has. And the thing is, she has enough machines to cover the polling place with a 13,000-voter burden. You could take some of those machines and split them out to other sites, and you would still have enough voting machines. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Does it have anything to do with who the secretary of state is-Kris Kobach? And now he's running for governor, the man who led the now-defunct, disgraced so-called voter integrity commission for Trump. And even in the Trump Administration, they had to get rid of it. Now Kris Kobach running for governor against Democrat Laura Kelly.\n\nJOHNNY DUNLAP : Well, so, yeah. The thing is, the secretary of state has to-or, has the power to stop something like this and approves it. So, for the last eight years, Kris Kobach has signed off on one polling place in Dodge City, Kansas. And really, this is part of a larger narrative for him. I mean, he passed-or, we passed in Kansas bills that he championed and wrote, that have since been declared unconstitutional because they disenfranchise voters.\n\nAnd on the ground in Dodge City, that's made things difficult. Like we've attempted to have voting drives and things-I mean, excuse me, voter registration drives in Dodge City. And when Kris Kobach's-before Kris Kobach's voter ID law, which required citizens to prove their citizenship, so it reversed the burden of proof from the government to the citizen, and so folks would register to vote, and then they'd have to go to the county clerk and present their birth certificate or some sort of proof of citizenship. And so, what happened in these voter registration drives is that, you know, folks would start filling out the form, and then we would say, \"OK, well, now, you know, you need to take this to the county clerk along with your birth certificate, and then you'll be registered to vote.\" And they would be in shock and angry. And some of them even like tore up their voter registration card and said, \"No, no. Forget about it. This is too much.\"\n\nSo, it's just-this thing in Dodge City this year is, again, I think, part of a larger problem, where the Republican Party in Kansas has taken a lot of steps to make voting more difficult, to put obstacles in the way of people registering, of people getting to the polls. It's a bigger problem.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Johnny Dunlap, we want to thank you for being with us, chair of the Ford County, Kansas, Democratic Party, as we move on to our next segment.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "How Trump won over Latino and Hispanic voters in historic numbers\n\nExperts say president-elect's bombastic attitude and economic messaging helped flip traditionally blue counties\n\nThe raucous early morning celebration in Miami 's Little Havana neighborhood was of a magnitude not seen since the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro died eight years previously. In the immigrant-saturated suburb of Westchester, too, Latinos partied beyond daybreak as Donald Trump 's return to the White House was confirmed.\n\nWednesday morning's revelry in south Florida reflected a stunning victory for Trump in the previously solid blue, Hispanic-majority county of Miami-Dade that had not been won by a Republican presidential candidate in more than 30 years.\n\nHis victory, fueled largely by support from Latino and Hispanic voters, particularly Latino men, was repeated in county after county in swing states as the Democrats' blue wall crumbled and it became clear Trump would once again be president.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, hordes of Puerto Ricans who saw their homeland demeaned as a \" floating island of garbage \" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally barely a week before, flocked to give him their vote.\n\nIn Wisconsin, exit polls showed a six-point rise from 2020, to 43%, in Trump's Hispanic support, despite his condemnation of certain immigrants as \"drug dealers\", \"murderers\" and \"rapists\", and promise to conduct the largest deportation effort in US history soon after he takes office.\n\nAnd among other minority groups, Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan also seemed able to overlook Trump's full-throated support of Israel's military onslaught in Gaza to show up for him in large numbers. In large part, that move was as much an effort to vote against Kamala Harris as many in the Arab and Muslim American communities have expressed anger with the Biden administration - and, by extension, Harris - for its support for Israel.\n\nAnalysts, while noting that the election was only a few days ago and a full picture of voting patterns has yet to emerge, suggest a multitude of reasons why a candidate so openly hostile to immigrants would be championed by them in such large numbers.\n\nFault, they say, can be attributed to Democrats' failure to understand the nuances of the Hispanic and Latino voting populations. There were clear signs as early as January that then candidate Joe Biden 's support from that demographic had cratered , and Trump's was rising.\n\nUltimately, it was Republicans' economic messaging that broke through most, several experts said. That was then combined with an admiration for Trump's bombastic and pugnacious style among Latino men who, as much as white men and women who form his base, have no problem with his insults, racism and threats, because they don't believe he is talking about them.\n\n\"There seems to be an attraction to Trump among Latinos, Latino men, that could be a kind of defensive reaction to his aggression and aggressive rhetoric,\" said Guillermo Grenier, professor of sociology at Florida International University and the co-author of the book This Land is Our Land: Newcomers and Established Residents in Miami.\n\n\"It could be they're saying: 'I'm not one of them, you know? I'm an American citizen, I'm voting for you, I'm not the rapist scum, I'm not with them. That's the other guys, the other immigrants, not the voting immigrants.'\"\n\nGrenier also points to the \"arrogance\" of Democrats in assuming Latinos, and other minority voting groups would gravitate towards them.\n\n\"They always have a kind of a sense of entitlement to the minority vote. They don't put the muscle in but think African Americans should vote for them, that Latinos should vote for them, because they're the big tent party,\" he said.\n\n\"But we're in an age of identity politics. You can't just talk generally about ambitions and accessibility and dreams if the opposite side is digging very deeply, focusing and talking directly to the people they need to attract ... When people talk about why they like Trump it's that kind of directness, and if you don't have a strategy to counter that delivery then you are just kind of flailing.\"\n\nCarlos Suárez Carrasquillo, political science professor at the University of Florida's center for Latin American studies, sees Latino men as equally susceptible to Trump's braggadocio and misogynistic proclivities as any other group of males.\n\n\"If white males find Trump appealing as a candidate, why wouldn't Latino males?\" he said.\n\n\"A larger conversation is whether the constituency of Latino males is inherently Democrat. Or maybe aspects of gender that Trump plays up really well is a dynamic pitching at Latino males.\"\n\nSuárez also suggests Trump's growing appeal to male Latino voters - he was the first Republican presidential candidate to win them outright - could be that it makes them feel more American.\n\n\"You can imagine that in some Latino quarters, supporting Trump is a way to assimilate, to incorporate,\" he said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"Is the Latino experience in the US becoming slowly but surely more similar to the American white experience? Could this also be a sign that the voting behavior of Latinos, slowly but surely, start to resemble more that of white America and, in this case, white males? The argument could be made.\"\n\nGrenier, meanwhile, sees Latino voters frustrated when they feel they are being patronized.\n\n\"In the political narrative of both parties they are treated as not American, or as a special kind of American,\" he said.\n\n\"Democrats come down and give their foreign policy speech about communism and authoritarianism like it's their number one issue, and treat these south Floridians, whether they're Venezuelans, Cubans or [other Hispanic or Latino nationalities], as refugees, immigrants or exiles.\n\n\"But their top three issues, like anywhere in the country, are the economy, healthcare and immigration, boom boom boom.\"\n\nOther analysts agree that the Harris campaign's failures can help explain Latino turnout for Trump, which saw a 14-point increase since the 2020 election.\n\n\"The Latino vote was the parties' to win, not the other way around. A significant proportion of Latinos do not have strong ties to either party,\" said Ana Valdez, president and chief executive of the Latino Donor Collaborative, in a statement.\n\nValdez noted that while \"rhetoric from the right has been hurtful and horrible,\" the \"Democratic party has let many Latinos down.\"\n\n\"They promised much and delivered little,\" she said, adding that promises to tackle issues like immigration reform fell short.\n\n\"Many Latino voters feel ignored and unrepresented [and] Trump's team made calculated moves to reach culturally conservative Latinos. They tapped into something real for these voters, the appeal to traditional values, economic opportunity,and a message that resonated on a personal level.\n\nShe continued: \"With wealthier Latinos, his team pushed concerns over taxes and inflation with a directness that resonated. When it comes to young Latinos, the Trump campaign clearly did more to build their platform digitally, studying and investing more in targeting Latinos on social media.\n\n\"The Latino vote continues to be the biggest blind spot for both parties. But this massive shift compared to 2020 highlights that the winning side better understood the frustrations of the Latino community and took advantage.\"\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "Nevada's Latino voters are demoralised. Their votes could decide the presidency\n\nIn Nevada, a key swing state, most Latino voters tend to choose Democrats. But the party hasn't solidified support - a problem for Biden, strategists say\n\nIn East Las Vegas last week, there were few signs that Nevada was gearing up for the first presidential election contest in the western US, happening in mere days.\n\nThe neighbourhood, the heart of the city's Latino community, was bereft of lawn signs and campaign banners. There were no clipboard-wielding canvassers crowding its wide, palm-tree-lined streets. An occasional ad on the local Spanish-language radio station, encouraging listeners to vote, was one of the few signs that the presidential primaries were coming up.\n\n\"Will I vote in the primaries? Yeah, maybe,\" said Ruby Romero, 38, who owns a boutique in Vegas's arts district. But, she admitted, she had almost forgotten about it.\n\nThis week's elections aren't exactly competitive, and will inevitably move Joe Biden and Donald Trump toward a rematch in November.\n\nBut in an election year that will determine the future of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, the chances of meaningful climate action, the shape of the economy and perhaps even the fate of American democracy, voters here appeared particularly demoralised.\n\nLatinos make up one in five voters in the state, and in 2020 about 60% of Latino voters backed Joe Biden. It remains unclear, however, whether Democrats will be able to energise enough voters this year to replicate that feat.\n\nIn polling, Latino voters in the state have consistently indicated they're worried about inflation, jobs, housing and healthcare costs. The war in Gaza and the administration's unwavering support for Israel have angered many young progressive voters, organisers said.\n\nRomero has voted in nearly every election since she turned 18, usually for Democrats. \"And I always encourage my parents to vote as well,\" she said. This year, however, she is finding herself unsure of what to do.\n\nShe has been disheartened by the Biden administration's refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has been especially disappointed by Kamala Harris's silence on the plight of women and children there, she said.\n\nVoters, Romero said, are being asked to choose Biden and Harris as the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n\"But I have standards, you know. I'm not going to go on a date with a dude that is below my standards. So why am I going to vote for such a person to run our country?\" she said.\n\n\"The issue is that Democrats haven't necessarily solidified [Latino] support,\" said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, the vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at the advocacy group UnidosUS.\n\nNevada was once an undisputed Republican stronghold - until the late senator Harry Reid started reaching out to Latino voters.\n\nReid began his congressional tenure hawking harsh anti-immigration policies and fought to end birthright citizenship. But his views - and political strategy - changed with his electorate.\n\nHe understood that those who were going to vote against him would vote against him, and that he needed to give the others a reason to vote for him, said Martinez. \"And he didn't rest on his laurels,\" she said. \"He reached out to voters with a level of intensity and dedication that led to one of the highest levels of support from Latino voters.\"\n\nThe \"Reid machine\" relied heavily on grassroots engagement of working-class Latino voters to turn Nevada Democratic. He engaged the Culinary Workers Union, a powerhouse in Nevada that represents 60,000 hospitality workers across the state and runs the largest canvassing operation there - contacting more than half the state's Black and Latino voters in the process.\n\n\"Our program really gets workers talking to workers,\" said Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer. \"And working-class voters understand who is in their corner.\"\n\nReid understood that a key element of his success was showing up, consistently. It's a lesson Democratic politicians over the years have forgotten, said Martinez.\n\nSupport for Democratic candidates among Latino voters in the state has significantly slipped since 2012, when Barack Obama won more than 71%, and 2016, when Hillary Clinton won 66%.\n\nAdd to that deep concerns about the economy and the war in Gaza, and organisers say there's reason enough to be concerned that Latino voters will simply not be motivated enough to head to the polls.\n\nAmong young Democratic voters, \"the administration's stance on the Israel-Gaza war is going to make it nearly impossible to convince young brown people that voting matters\", said Leo Murrieta, the director of Make the Road Action in Nevada, a progressive group that has been registering Latino voters. \"They're mad.\"\n\nIt doesn't help, Murrieta said, that Democrats and Biden have done a poor job highlighting the tangible ways in which they have been improving Americans' daily lives. Latino voters need to hear more about how Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has helped dramatically drive down the cost of insulin for millions of Americans, he said. Or how funding from the IRA has brought 11,500 clean-energy jobs to Nevada. Or how the economy is actually doing pretty well overall. \"We're not seeing that,\" he said. \"It just doesn't make sense.\"\n\nWhen Biden does talk about such accomplishments, the message often isn't thoughtfully or strategically directed toward the mostly Mexican American Latinos who make up nearly 20% of Nevada's electorate.\n\nNeither party is particularly good at campaigning in Latino communities, said Serafin Calvo, of Chicanos Por La Causa, a community development group, and a longtime administrator for the cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas.\n\nPresidential candidates tend to show up in Latino communities right before the general election, he said, and offer free tacos. \"Maybe they feel these are going to be easy votes to win, so they wait for the last minute,\" Calvo said.\n\nOn Sunday, the president held a rally in Las Vegas's historic Westside, a hub of Black culture and community, and emphasized the stakes of the elections.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, came to campaign in East Las Vegas last week. Speaking to a mostly white crowd in a neighbourhood where more than half of all residents are Latino, he honed in on immigration. Claiming that thousands of terrorists, rapists and criminals are \"flowing in\" via the southern border, he touted the Texas governor Greg Abbott's renegade use of razor wire and barriers to deter people from crossing the border.\n\n\"I predict that the Hispanic support for Donald Trump is just going to get better and stronger, it's going to grow,\" said Jesus Marquez, a Las Vegas-based political consultant and Trump surrogate. Polls have found that immigration ranks below the economy, healthcare and affordable housing as a major concern for Nevada's Latino voters. But Marquez said the former president makes a compelling argument that unauthorised immigration and the rush of migrants at the border will hurt immigrant families who are already in the US. He brushed off concerns that Trump's sometimes extreme rhetoric about immigration and immigrants will alienate Latino voters whose families are made up of immigrants.\n\nStill, Marquez said that he'd advise the campaign to focus on economic issues, school choice and religious liberties - all issues with which Trump could compellingly appeal to conservative Latino voters. \"I do believe that this cycle, Republicans are ready to have a more organised ground operation and gain on their margins,\" he said.\n\nFor first-generation Mexican Americans, that might mean Spanish-language radio ads about the economy. Cuban Americans, who make up the third-largest Latino demographic group after Mexican and Central Americans in Nevada, may need different messaging. Marquez's own work though the American Christian Caucus focuses on grassroots organising via churches.\n\nPolling from November 2023 found that while support for Biden had dipped since 2020, and about 20% of Latino voters remained undecided, most felt that the Democratic party overall was better suited to addressing the issues they were most concerned about, including inflation and the cost of living. \"The Republican party seems radically out of step with some of the solutions these voters want to see,\" argued Martinez of UnidosUS.\n\n\"For me, Trump is chaos,\" said Beatriz Bedoya, 78, a volunteer with Make the Road Action who has already begun a personal canvassing effort to convince her 21-year-old grandson to vote. \"[My grandson] says he just doesn't want to talk about politics - and my son says, 'Mami, don't pressure him,'\" she laughed. \"But I'm still working on it.\n\nFor years, Bedoya has been relentless in dragging friends, family members, the young girls in her neighbourhood - everyone - to the polls. This year, she said, she plans to be even more persistent. When it comes to Biden, \"we can talk about the good things and the bad things\", she said. \"But we don't have another option.\" They can help elect him and push him on policies, or face four more years of chaos.\n\nShe understands why people might want to turn away, and why they might feel disheartened. \"It's hard to convince, it's hard to talk to young people. But I tell them, we have to fight,\" she said. \"We have to push, and work hard for our democracy.\n\nThe one group that is optimistic about Biden's chances in the state is the culinary union, which plans to ramp up canvassing efforts in the late spring and summer and deploy nearly 500 members to knock on more than a million doors.\n\nPappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer, predicts that workers - and their families - will not forget that Biden was the first sitting president to join a picket line last fall, when he appeared in solidarity with striking United Auto Workers members last fall.\n\nAnd while inflation and spiking housing costs remain major concerns for members, unionised workers - unlike most other voters across the country - are acutely aware of how well the economy is doing, he argued.\n\nJobs are plentiful and development is booming, said Mario Sandoval, 58, a server at the steakhouse in Binion's Gambling Hall. It's just that wages and benefits haven't kept up, which is what the union is trying to address in current negotiations with resorts. \"But the economy's doing good - it's good to me,\" Sandoval said. \"Inflation is going down. Gas is down. There was all this talk of a recession and I've seen no sign of it.\""

      "text": "'Leaning into the whiteness': journalist Paola Ramos on why some Latinos have turned to the far right\n\nLatino voters, once reliably Democratic, increasingly pledge support for Trump despite his xenophobic rhetoric\n\nW hen the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made racist and disparaging comments about Latinos and referred to Puerto Rico as \" a floating island of garbage \", at a Donald Trump rally in New York on Sunday, it was met with outrage from many Latino politicians , voters and celebrities . Still, those comments did not deter some Republican Latinos from affirming their support for Trump.\n\n\"If you were already supporting Trump, I don't think this is a comment that will make you reconsider that choice,\" said the journalist Paola Ramos, the author of Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What it Means for America.\n\nHowever, Ramos said that she has talked to some Latino voters who are now realizing that Trump's xenophobia could include them: \"The question is for those that are independent, or those that were flirting with the idea of voting for Trump. The biggest difference is that the narrative, for the first time in a while, shifted from being targeted at immigrants to suddenly being targeted, not just directly at Latinos, but even US citizens. That has sort of awakened a lot of people for the first time to be like, 'Oh, wait a second.'\n\n\"We've been so used to pinpointing a narrative at the border, on immigrants, on migrants, on undocumented people, and then suddenly the conversation has shifted to people within us and inside us.\"\n\nDon't miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 presidential election , Trump has gained inroads from Latino voters, a base that was once reliably Democratic . While the majority of Latinos favor Kamala Harris , the shift is pronounced among Latino men, with 44% saying that they support Trump, up from 37% in 2020, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll .\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThat political shift toward far-right sentiments in Latino communities can be attributed to tribalism, traditionalism and trauma, Ramos writes in Defectors. Tribalism refers to internalised racism, while traditionalism is based on conservative moral values and the ongoing effects of colonialism, and trauma comes from grappling with political upheaval in Latin America. Additionally, fantasy heritage, a concept coined by the civil rights activist and historian Carey McWilliams in the late 1940s in which Latinos whitewash their Indigenous or Black roots in favor of their Spanish ancestry, draws some Latinos to white supremacist values.\n\n\"One of the entry points for far right Latinos into the world of white supremacy and white nationalism is by leaning into the Spanish heritage, leaning into the whiteness,\" Ramos said. For instance, she interviewed Mexican American border vigilantes who held anti-immigration beliefs because they distanced themselves from their immigrant roots.\n\nRamos also spoke with African Dominican Trump supporters in the Bronx who highlight their Spanish ancestry over their African roots, although they are racialized as Black in the US. \"But in their minds, because of fantasy heritage, they see themselves more aligned racially with Trump's America than they do with Blackness, and so I think that that's where Trump is able to tap into some of that racial grievance.\"\n\nThe path toward democracy in Latin American countries has often involved an authoritarian strongman, Ramos writes in her book. In the late 1970s, for instance, 17 out of 20 Latin American nations were ruled by dictators. Ramos interviewed Eulalia Jimenez, the leader of the conservative parents rights group Moms for Liberty, and Anthony Aguero, a border vigilante in Texas, whose political trauma manifested into far-right sentiments.\n\nTrauma is also what drew some supporters, such as the Cuban American Gabriel Garcia, a Proud Boys member, to join the January 6 insurrection after Trump lost the election. Garcia's parents, who were unaccompanied minors airlifted out of Cuba during a covert US program in the 1960s, instilled in him a fear of communism and conservative sentiments that would inform his political beliefs. \"At a time when democracy seems to feel a little messy for some folks,\" Ramos said, \"the elements of authoritarianism [aren't] as scary for some Latinos.\"\n\nIn order to win back Latino votes, Ramos said, progressives must understand the complicated and rich nature of Latino identity and their quest for belonging in the US - which is all the more important now, as the country is projected to become a majority minority nation in 2045.\n\nYounger Latinos over the past decade have grown emboldened to challenge the Democratic party. \"Part of that requires a level of curiosity to understand why internalized racism works so well, and why colorism is so present, and why anti-Blackness and these anti-immigrant sentiments can really manifest themselves,\" Ramos said. \"And I think part of that is just having conversations around identity that I think in the party they haven't had.\"\n\nSince her book launched in September, Ramos has talked to Latino voters while touring cities from New York to Los Angeles, an experience she described as \"group therapy\". Some readers shared the pain that they felt of having undocumented immigrants as well as Trump supporters in their family, or young Latinos seeking acceptance from their religious families. \"They've been really emotional, really personal, and I think painful too.\" She urged progressives to understand \"the pain that a lot of people are going through with not feeling a big solidarity right now\".\n\nWhile it is easy to see Trump supporters as radical, Ramos said that a deeper understanding of Latin American history is crucial to regaining the trust of Latino voters who are disillusioned by politics. Toward the end of Defectors, Ramos illustrated a future in which Latinos embrace their complex history and identity in a quest for collective liberation. \"In that future, we finally wake up freer,\" Ramos concluded in the book. \"Welcome to the year 2045.\""

      "text": "Can Kamala Harris win over disenchanted Latino voters?\n\nLatinos had ranked among the Democrats' most reliable bases - but the party's once dominant advantage has shrunk\n\nT he abrupt substitution of Kamala Harris for Joe Biden as the Democratic party's presidential nominee has energized two of the party's bedrock bases of support - pro-choice women and African Americans - along with millions of young voters who felt dismay at the Hobson's choice posed by two old white guys in the presidential contest.\n\nBut the country's estimated 36 million eligible Latino voters could be another story.\n\nTheir importance in presidential races has been steadily growing over the past 50 years, and Latinos are projected to represent nearly 15% of eligible voters nationwide by November.\n\nHistorically, Latinos have ranked among the Democratic party's most reliable sources of votes, in about the same league as Black and Jewish voters. But the party's once commanding advantage has been shrinking. Hillary Clinton trounced Donald Trump among Latinos nationwide in 2016 by a factor of 81% to 16%, yet four years later the former president upped his share to one out of every four votes cast by Latinos.\n\nA slew of prominent Latino politicians and trade unionists have endorsed the vice-president since the president's withdrawal from the race on 21 July. They include some progressive Democrats who had condemned the terse message Harris had for would-be Latin American immigrants to the United States during a 2021 press conference in Guatemala City: \"Do not come.\"\n\nBut it remains unclear whether Latino voters overall will give Harris a big boost in her bid to defeat Trump. For starters, they are diverse in national origin as well as the circumstances and histories of their communities' immigration.\n\nMost southern California Chicanos reflect their state's liberal tendencies and have little in common ideologically with the majority of Miami's right-leaning Cuban Americans. Phoenix-based pollster Mike Noble notes that Latino voters whose roots go back to Colombia, Venezuela and other South American countries have been gravitating towards the Republican party over the past four years.\n\nLatinos are not yet digging deep into their pockets to support Harris. Two Zoom fundraising calls with Black women and men held on consecutive nights right after Biden bowed out brought in a total of $2.8m. Similar Zoom calls with Latinas and Latinos for Kamala on 24 and 31 July, respectively, posted a combined net haul of $188,000.\n\nAxios Latino has been tracking US Latinos' views of Harris in conjunction with Noticias Telemundo and the Ipsos market research and public opinion firm since the first year of the Biden administration. By the end of 2021, Axios Latino found that 48% of Latinos had a favorable opinion of Harris - but that figure had slumped to 39% by last March. A different survey of Latinos in 10 states found that sentiment persisted in Arizona and Nevada even days after Biden's fateful debate performance in late June.\n\nBut a more recent survey of 800 Latino voters living in seven swing states brought Harris and the Democrats some very welcome news. Carried out by the pollster Gary Segura on behalf of the Washington-based Somos Political Action Committee in the immediate aftermath of Biden's bombshell announcement, the survey gave Harris an impressive 18-percentage-point lead over Trump and surprisingly high favorability ratings among Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada , which have the highest percentage of eligible Latino voters among those swing states.\n\nIn a separate poll by Equis Research released Wednesday, Harris is still a few points short of Biden's support from Latino voters in the 2020 election, but is still leading Trump by 19 points among registered Latino voters in the seven most competitive states.\n\nHarris and her newly selected running mate, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, addressed rallies in Phoenix and Las Vegas late last week, and a new 30-second TV spot aimed at Latino voters has started airing in both English and Spanish.\n\n\"Throughout her career, she's always worked to earn the support of Latino voters and has made core issues like healthcare, childcare and fighting gun violence her focus,\" said the campaign's Hispanic media director, Maca Casado. \"Vice-President Harris's campaign knows Latinos' political power, and we won't take their votes for granted.\"\n\nIn Harris's performance at the polls among Latinos in her native California, she garnered a majority of the Latino vote in both of her successful campaigns for the office of state attorney general, in 2010 and 2014.\n\nBut Latinos are not expected to play a decisive role in the Golden state or any of the other three states where they are most numerous. Both California and New York are widely considered to be a lock for Democrats, and the same is true of Texas and Florida for Republicans .\n\nThat leaves Arizona and Nevada, and the outlook for Democrats remains cloudy.\n\nCNN exit polling in November 2020 showed Biden beating Trump handily among Arizona Latino voters by a 27-percentage-point margin, thanks in part to folks like Matthew Sotelo. The 37-year-old leader of a non-profit community organization in Phoenix is a registered Democrat who thinks that Biden has done a \"solid\" job as president. But Sotelo senses a welcome change in the political climate since Harris became the party's standard bearer.\n\n\"The energy is different, and despite what the polls say about Harris being in a dead heat with Trump, the momentum is swinging to her side,\" says the Arizona-born Mexican American.\n\nDuring Harris's abortive run for the presidency in 2019, Sotelo did have some reservations about her track record as a prosecutor in San Francisco who sought prison terms for people arrested for possession of small amounts of controlled substances. But he sees her as an open-minded politician.\n\n\"Do I think she has done a perfect job [on the border]? Absolutely not,\" says Sotelo. \"But I understand there has been an opportunity for Harris to grow as a leader, and she'll continue to learn and grow.\"\n\nOne seasoned Latino pollster warns that Republicans have made major inroads in Arizona. \"The Democrats have been losing ground there, and a lot of it has to do with the border,\" says Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University professor of political science who oversaw last month's poll of Latino voters in 10 states.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nFelix Garcia concurs. Born in the Mexican state of Sonora and a resident of Phoenix since 2000, the 42-year-old business consultant has spent his entire life on either side of the US-Mexican border.\n\n\"We have so many people from different countries on the border every day, and Kamala has never tried to fix the situation on the border,\" says the registered Republican, who describes himself as a moderate in the mold of the late Arizona senator John McCain.\n\nGarcia's issues with Harris do not end with immigration. \"We have so many problems with the Biden administration - inflation, Ukraine, Russia, Israel - and she is part of this administration,\" he says.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Arizona last Friday, Harris drew attention to the years she served as California's attorney general. \"I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers,\" she declared. \"I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.\"\n\nMike Noble, a former consultant and manager of Republican legislative campaigns in Arizona, found that many Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada are focused on pocketbook issues like inflation and housing affordability. Those anxieties are not likely to favor Harris.\n\n\"She's done a little better in places like the midwest and Pennsylvania, but in the sun belt, Harris is basically starting off in the same position as Biden was,\" he says.\n\nThe ascent of Harris has left David Navarro unmoved. The 27-year-old native of Las Vegas is a registered Democrat who supported Bernie Sanders' presidential bids in 2016 and 2020 and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. But he says he is done with both major political parties and will vote for Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the fall.\n\n\"I don't support their views or any of their policies towards Israel and Gaza, and neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are doing anything to address the causes of inflation, which are corporations and their price increases,\" says the systems engineer whose father immigrated from El Salvador. \"They don't value us as Americans, and I don't want a presidential candidate who is run by the major donors who are billionaires and the corporations.\"\n\nA scholar from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) cautions that many Latinos in that state, like millions of Americans across the country regardless of their race or ethnicity, do not know all that much about Harris at this juncture beyond her name and current job title.\n\n\"People know Biden and Trump, but when it comes to Harris, she has a lot more opportunity to shape the narrative, introduce herself and recalibrate things,\" says Rebecca Gill, UNLV associate professor of political science. \"She has the potential to move her numbers more than Trump or Biden.\"\n\nIn a volatile election cycle already punctuated by an assassination attempt, a debate debacle of historic dimensions, and the nomination of the first Black female presidential candidate of a major political party, Latino voters could spring surprises of their own even in swing states with relatively small Latino populations.\n\n\"The Hispanic vote is large enough in virtually every state in the US that it could make the difference between winning and losing, including Pennsylvania and Georgia,\" notes Fernand Amandi, a Miami-based Democratic pollster who specializes in tracking voting trends in the Latino community.\n\n\"It's the very reason why so many people are hyper-focused on the Hispanic vote.\""

      "text": "'We captured magic': the telenovelas reaching Latino voters in swing states\n\nGroup Poder NC Action seeks to create culturally relevant voter engagement initiatives that speak directly to Latinos\n\n\" Una chingona always knows when to use her own voice.\"\n\nSo begins the first installment of a telenovela geared toward young Latina voters. Chingonas, which means empowered women in Mexican Spanish, are the target audience for the non-profit Poder NC Action - a Latino North Carolina-based voter engagement group. This year, the largest ever cohort of young North Carolina-born Latinos will be eligible to vote in a presidential election.\n\nThe unique eight-part series released last month on YouTube was created to close the gap between registration and turnout for Latino voters, who have historically voted less than some other groups, in the key battleground state. In the short films, the main character Alexia is a young Latina who goes from struggling to voice her opinions with her community and family to encouraging strangers to turn out to vote.\n\n\"We captured magic somehow,\" Irene Godinez, the executive director of Poder NC Action, said about the telenovelas. \"The fact that 18-year-old boys to a 70-something-year-old woman feel seen in this and are excited about it is unheard of.\"\n\nNow, the films' reach has extended beyond North Carolina, with voter engagement organizations in California , Wisconsin , Arizona , Florida , Texas, Georgia and Colorado featuring them on social media platforms. The videos appear in Hulu and YouTube TV ads; the non-profit Voto Latino will use them in a digital public service announcement ahead of the election, and in the fall, Latino fraternal chapters, such as Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc and Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Inc, will screen the telenovelas on campuses around the country.\n\nNationwide, an estimated 36.2 million Latino voters will be eligible to vote this year, nearly 15% of the electorate , according to Pew Research Center. Godinez foresaw the large swath of eligible voters coming to age when she launched the non-profit in 2020: \"My calculation was, if we start talking to them right now that they're in high school and we can get them in as volunteers,\" said Godinez. \"Then by the time that they become actual voting age, they'll be not only informed, but they'll be willing to inform their peers.\"\n\nBefore Poder NC Action's inception in 2020, political parties and advocacy groups did not invest in voter engagement efforts for Latino voters in North Carolina, said Godinez. She sought to create culturally relevant voter engagement initiatives that spoke directly to young Latino voters.\n\n\"The people who absolutely are being neglected, it doesn't mean that they're not interested,\" Godinez said. \"It just means that no one has made an effort to reach out to them.\"\n\nThe organization's strategy has been to focus on courting around 150,000 Latino voters who have voted twice or less since registering to vote in 2016. Their outreach consists of political mailers, phonebanking, canvassing, and monthly social hours where voters meet local politicians.\n\nIn 2020, Poder NC Action hand delivered 4,000 voter information cards throughout the state, made over 1m calls, delivered over 1m mailers, and worked with 130 young Latino volunteers. Godinez said that their efforts helped North Carolina Latino voters become 40% of the overall Latino voter turnout in 2020.\n\nAnd in 2022, a quarter of the organization's targeted voters voted in the midterm election. The organization is taking cue from its members on whether they will endorse a presidential candidate. \"It's even likely that we would endorse Kamala Harris,\" Godinez said, \"but it will boil down to what our membership determines\".\n\nIn February, Poder NC Action hosted a Barbie movie-themed event where volunteers escorted the 50 attendees down a pink carpet that led to a barbie photo booth so they could post photos on social media. It was the second time that the organization hosted the voter registration event called Ballots y Belleza, where attendees get free beauty services including makeup and waxing as they study sample ballots and volunteers inform them about voting issues. In September, the group will host another Ballots y Belleza event for Latinx Heritage Month that focuses on the theme \"Poder (Power) is our Heritage, too,\" said Godinez.\n\nThe event was inspired by a 15-year-old who begrudgingly attended one of the group's social hour events with an older sibling last summer. The teen told Godinez that she would willingly sit through a daylong civic engagement meeting if she could simultaneously get her nails done. \"We wanted to create a space where folks could come and learn and build community with each other,\" Godinez said, \"and then create some sort of connection with us as well\".\n\nFollowing Poder NC Action's events, attenders have told Godinez that they feel \"seen\" in her programming. \"Organizations create different types of programming tailored to voters, but they do it as if voters are different from their loved ones. They don't look at voters particularly as an extension of themselves,\" Godinez said. \"We see our families in our voters. We see ourselves in our voters.\"\n\nThe work that Poder NC Action is doing to engage Latino voters could serve as a model for organizations in other states throughout the nation, said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic party strategist and president of consulting firm Solidarity Strategies. As a consultant to the organization for the past six years, Rocha said that Poder NC Action's work stood out because it was rooted in the Latino community: Poder NC Action is run by a Latina woman, while the staff, consultants and artists that work on products are also Latino.\n\n\"There's lots of Spanish ads made by congressional candidates or governors candidates, but it's just made by their same white consultants, normally translated from English,\" Rocha said. \"They're all well-meaning, but it just doesn't have the same look and feel when it's made from the community, by the community, for the community.\"\n\nAt the end of September, Poder NC Action will launch another telenovela series that focuses on reproductive justice. Starting in mid-October, the organization will host a mobile Ballots y Belleza on a party bus where young voters will receive beauty services at historically Black colleges and universities, as well as public universities around North Carolina.\n\nUltimately, Godinez hopes that Poder NC's initiatives will help inspire a new generation of voters to become civically engaged. \"We're creating a paper trail of everything so that we can share it with organizations that our values align no matter where they are, so that way, if something is working well here, there's no reason that we would hold on to it and not share it.\""

      "text": "Hispanic and Latino representation in film hasn't improved for 16 years - study\n\nUSC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative finds that representation behind and in front of the camera remains stagnant\n\nHispanics and Latinos remain underrepresented in film, a trend that has carried for 16 years, according to a new report from the University of Southern California. Even when movies did feature Hispanic or Latino characters, they were usually stereotyped as immigrant or as having low income.\n\nThe latest study from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative examined 1,600 of the top-grossing films released between 2007 and 2022 and more than 62,000 speaking characters, as well as 13,000 directors, producers and casting directors.\n\nIn the 16 years examined, only 75 (4.4%) actors in lead or co-lead roles were Hispanic or Latino; only five were Hispanic/Latina actors 45 years or older, and three of those roles were played by Jennifer Lopez. Less than 1% of all lead/co-lead roles since 2007 went to Afro-Latino actors, while 2.6% of all lead actors were US-born Latinos. There was not one year examined in which all film distributors released at least one movie with a Hispanic or Latino lead/co-lead.\n\n\"There is a clear and persistent lack of stories that center on Hispanic/Latino actors and the Hispanic/Latino experience,\" said Ariana Case, the study's lead author. \"Despite the profusion of talent from this community, there is a clear reluctance on the part of the entertainment industry to develop and distribute these stories.\"\n\nOf the seven biggest distributors, four had fewer than 10 films with a Hispanic of Latino lead during that timeframe. Warner Brothers had the worst record of the major studios, according to the study, with just three movies featuring a Hispanic/Latino lead or co-lead role in the 16-year span.\n\nThe study also found that when Hispanic/Latino characters were represented on-screen, depictions were often rife with stereotypes. Nearly a quarter (24.4%) of Hispanic/Latino leads were depicted as immigrants, and the same percentage shown as low income. More than half (57.8%) were depicted as criminals, and nearly half (46.2%) as violent criminals. Forty per cent were portrayed as angry or temperamental, and 31.1% were sexualized.\n\nAfro-Latinos were particularly underrepresented. The study found that across the 100 top movies of 2022, just one protagonist - Nathalie Emmanuel in The Invitation - was portrayed by an Afro-Latina, and only eight Afro-Latino actors were cast in lead/co-lead roles between 2007 and 2016, representing less than 1% of all lead roles.\n\nThe same held true for intersectionality for Hispanic/Latino characters. The study revealed that more than 95% of movies from between 2014 and 2022 were missing LGBTQ+ Hispanic/Latino characters, and only 1.8% of Hispanic/Latino characters in 2022 were shown with a disability.\n\n\"Hispanic/Latinos are not a monolithic community, but film offers a very narrow picture that does little to communicate how diverse this group is,\" said Case. \"There is almost no representation of the array of communities that encompass this ethnic group. Few women, few LGBTQ+ Hispanic/Latinos and very few Hispanic/Latinos with disabilities are shown in film.\"\n\nHispanic and Latinos remain underrepresented behind the camera, as well. Across 16 years and 1,600 movies, less than 5% of directors were Hispanic or Latino, and only five of those 82 were women. The majority of Hispanic/Latino directors (69.5%) were born outside the US. And across the same time period, 3.1% of \"produced by\" credits went to Hispanic or Latinos; women represented 21.8% of those credits and less than 1% of producers overall.\n\nThe study offered roadmaps for change, including expanded casting lists, searches and expectations; supporting grants for Hispanic/Latino creatives behind and in front of the camera; and creating tax incentives for productions hiring Hispanic/Latino individuals above the line."

The decline in support among Latinos is seen as a canary in the coalmine for Democrats, signaling potential challenges in retaining a key part of the electoral coalition that built Biden's election victory in 2020.\n\nTrump leads among young voters under 35 with 37% support over Biden's 33%, a stark drop from Biden's 24-point lead among the voting group in 2020.\n\nHowever, although Biden was losing support among these groups of voters, they tend to lean toward third-party candidates instead of Trump, according to the poll which was conducted 26-29 December among 1,000 likely voters.\n\nTwenty per cent of Hispanic and Black voters surveyed said they would support someone other than Trump or Biden, while 21% of younger voters indicated the same outcome.\n\nIn December, a CNBC All-America Economic Survey also revealed a significant shift in support among Latino voters. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Trump now holds a five-point lead with Latino voters, erasing Biden's previous seven-point lead in October.\n\nThe survey, conducted between 8 and 12 December, suggests a decline in Biden's overall performance among Latino voters, with his approval dropping from 35% in October to 28% in December.\n\nHistorical data shows that Trump tends to perform better with Latino voters during economic stress.

The voter mobilization group's endorsement on Thursday, provided first to the Guardian, comes amid a rush of enthusiasm for Harris's nascent campaign.\n\n\"Harris taking on the nomination has added a new kind of energy,\" said Theo Oshiro, executive director at Make the Road New York. \"Our members are excited. Harris is a woman of colour, and a person who comes from an immigrant family. So they see their children or themselves in this candidate. They feel that she is someone who at least understands where we are coming from.\"\n\nThe decision to make this first-ever general election endorsement came after two meetings with more than 250 members, who debated the stakes of the election before ultimately agreeing to publicly support Harris.\n\nThe group is concerned about issues including housing affordability, the climate crisis and the US government's role in Israel's war on Gaza . But immigration rights were the main focus of deliberations.\n\nPainful memories from the Trump administration 's immigration policies, as well as his amped-up anti-immigrant rhetoric and his legally dubious plans for mass deportations and vast detention camps for migrants had upped the pressure. \"We are hungry, and ready to fight back,\" Oshiro said. \"This was one of those moments in history where we had to come together to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nHarris will need to shore up support from Latinx communities in swing states, including Pennsylvania and Nevada where Make the Road has a presence, to secure a victory in November. The organisation is on track to knock about 1m doors this election cycle - including half a million in Pennsylvania, and 330,000 in Nevada.\n\nMembers agreed that Harris has a complicated record on immigration, starting with her warning during her first foreign trip as vice-president to would-be Guatemalan immigrants: \"Do not come\" across the US-Mexico border. Harris will also have to answer for the Biden administration's decision to severely restrict asylum at the US southern border.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nBut Harris has also shown that she is someone who is willing to work with immigrant rights activists and push for much-needed reforms, Oshiro said. Shortly after the Biden administration announced his asylum restrictions, infuriating many Democrats and Latino leaders who likened them to Trump-era policies, the administration also unveiled a new plan to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented spouses of US citizens.\n\n\"We talked about this deeply, because the Biden administration, and by extension, Kamala Harris as Biden's vice-president, have not been perfect on immigration,\" Oshiro said. \"When we're doing endorsements, we're not picking a saviour. We're picking someone we think we can move and push to the right direction.\""

He wasn't feeling well, either, so she made him chicken noodle soup with Texas toast, the way he liked it.\n\n\"He was so weak and scared here by himself,\" Garcia said. \"That's why I came.\"\n\nEven though she wore a mask and gloves, she wound up sick four days later. Her father had given her Covid-19, but she didn't regret taking care of him. Because had she not, she wept, \"I would have never seen him again.\"\n\nA perfect storm of economic and cultural factors collided for a nightmarish summer in Garcia's south Texas community, Hidalgo county, which is 92.5% Hispanic or Latino . Residents there account for just 3% of the state's total population but roughly 8.6% of its known Covid-19 deaths. Ivan Melendez , the Hidalgo county health authority, said most transmission occurs through families.\n\n\"I think that poverty, proximity to the river, the large amounts of population growth that are undocumented, kind of forces families to bunch up together, which is exactly what you don't want,\" Melendez said.\n\nHidalgo county is part of the Rio Grande Valley, an impoverished region along Texas's southern border with Mexico. Underlying health conditions such as diabetes and obesity abound , increasing the risk of serious illness from Covid-19. Meanwhile, 46.8% of local Latinos ages 19-64 lack health insurance - a number that shoots up to 71.8% among non-citizens - creating potentially serious financial and logistical roadblocks to seeking medical attention .\n\nTight-knit families are a cornerstone of Latino culture. Those bonds, which are usually advantageous, have also been weaponized by the pandemic. Entrenched in Latino ideals is the principle of familism , or prioritizing family above individual needs. And, unlike in much of mainstream America, Latino family structures often include a larger swath of extended family members, explained Bernadette Sánchez, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nAmid life's most troubling moments or difficult change, families offer comfort for Latino communities. But the rituals in place - quinceañeras, weddings - require assembly, Melendez said.\n\nLikewise, there are \"expectations and obligations about the family supporting one another\", said Sánchez, an ethos that can turn tragic when an essential worker gets exposed to the virus.\n\n\"You could be taking all the measures yourself to be cautious, but it's not necessarily culturally acceptable to not be there for your family,\" Sánchez said.\n\nGarcia called the safety restrictions required by the pandemic a double-edged sword: \"you can't get close, yet you can't - don't - wanna stay away\". She had stopped visiting her parents to avoid infecting them, but they both contracted Covid-19 anyway, as did her aunt, uncle and cousin.\n\nOnce Covid-19 enters a Latino home, it's found an especially hospitable environment. \"It is more typical to see a multigenerational household,\" where grandparents reside with their children and grandchildren, and \"maybe an uncle or aunt lives there, too\", Sánchez said.\n\nIn Hidalgo county, four or five members of a single family often get sick with the virus, Melendez said. There are government resources to help family members who need to isolate, but to access those, the community has to know they exist.\n\nOne in every 10 Latino households in the Valley hosts three or more generations, and 13.2% of homes have more than one occupant per room. In such cramped quarters, there's little space for a \"sick room\" or \"separate bathroom\" to sequester, regardless of guidance published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n\"That's not possible,\" said Rogelio Sáenz, a professor of demography at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which then makes the situation \"even more dangerous\".\n\nThese systemic inequalities aren't confined to the Valley; the coronavirus pandemic has devastated Latinos, who are infected and hospitalized at much higher rates than white people, according to the CDC. Across Texas, Hispanics account for 54.5% of all deaths from Covid-19 , while only 39.7% of the overall population is either Hispanic or Latino.\n\nIn Hidalgo county, Priscilla Garcia's father was intubated first. Her mother suffered a heart attack. The couple was always together; they graduated, got married and worked out of the same house. But as they fought for their lives, they were relegated to separate hospitals.\n\n\"I had to be making their decisions for them while I was sick,\" Garcia said. \"It was really hard.\"\n\nBoth parents died, just days apart. Then, after more than a month-long fight, Garcia's aunt also succumbed to the virus. \"It's just so much going on that honestly you can't even think right,\" she said.\n\nShe's at least found a sliver of peace in a picture that she found of her parents, from when they were young. Her father is holding her mother's face, she thinks after he returned home from the army.\n\n\"It kinda gave me a little validation,\" she said, \"that they were together.\""

      "text": "Latino Voters May Be Changing Their Allegiances. It Could Change Their Influence, Too.\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nOnce seen as a bedrock constituency of the Democratic Party coalition, Latino voters shifted to the right in the 2024 presidential election - helping former President Donald Trump defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\n\nHow much Latinos moved toward Republicans is up for debate. Early exit polls showed a majority of Latino men voting for Trump ; however, these polls are notoriously inaccurate, particularly for measuring Latino voting . A somewhat more accurate count by the AP Votecast survey showed Harris winning 55% of the overall Latino vote compared to Trump's 43%. That was down from the 63%-35% margin AP Votecast reported President Joe Biden put up against Trump in 2020.\n\nSuch shifting voting patterns may provide Latinos greater influence as a swing constituency coveted by both political parties. But could it also lead to fewer Latinos holding political office?\n\nLatino political representation has increased at all levels, from the local city council to state legislatures and Congress, ever since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned electoral discrimination against racial minorities and its expansion in 1975 extended that protection to language minorities. In the House, there are currently 37 Latino-majority districts, mostly in California and Texas, and 47 members of Latino descent.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act created a process to protect the ability of racial minorities to vote for a candidate of their choosing through the creation of opportunity districts - city council, state legislature or congressional districts drawn with majority-minority populations - under certain circumstances . One of the most important circumstances identified by federal courts that upheld the law is when the vote choice of the white majority and that of a sizable racial minority group significantly diverge.\n\nThis racially polarized voting remains prevalent across the American South , where white voters cast ballots almost exclusively for Republicans and Black voters for Democrats. That has also been true for Latinos in the Southwest and some other areas with sizable populations like New York, Illinois and Florida.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating racially polarized voting, Voting Rights Act claims must show that the racial minority group is politically cohesive. That means the group largely votes as a bloc for a candidate of one party.\n\nBut if that racial polarization and political cohesion disappear - as they may have done in 2024 - then Voting Rights Act claims to create or defend existing Latino opportunity districts would be likely to fail.\n\n\"It's going to be substantially harder to win Voting Rights Act lawsuits,\" said Nicholas Stephanopolous, a Harvard Law School professor and voting rights expert. While what counts as \"cohesion\" may vary, it's not unusual to see margins of over 80% support for one party. \"It's an absolute prerequisite for a Voting Rights Act lawsuit to demonstrate minority political cohesion. If you've got Hispanic voters voting 55% for the Democrat and 45% for the Republican, that's almost the polar opposite of cohesion.\"\n\nTrump's gains with Latino voters, however, may not hold. President George W. Bush won over 40% of the Latino vote in his 2004 reelection campaign, but Latinos turned hard back into the Democrats' column in 2008.\n\n\"If it's a one-off presidential result then it's not that destabilizing,\" Stephanopolous said.\n\nMore importantly, Voting Rights Act claims for opportunity districts \"require a very local and particularized inquiry,\" according to Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a nonprofit that defends Latino voting rights.\n\nThat means that voting shifts at the presidential level matter far less than those in local, state or House races. And, so far, the Latino voter shift \"seems to be confined to the top of the ticket\" and \"to certain geographies,\" Saenz said.\n\nSouth Florida and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, heavily Latino regions that moved from providing nearly two-to-one margins to Democrats in 2016 to backing Trump in 2024, demonstrate the largest Latino vote shift in downballot races. It is possible that it may be harder to bring future Voting Rights Act claims in these localities. But that doesn't preclude such claims in other areas of Florida, Texas or the rest of the country - unless Latinos elsewhere continue to shift right.\n\nOutside of Florida and Texas, the success of Voting Rights Act claims for Latino opportunity districts will \"change very little,\" Saenz predicted. There may even be new opportunities in states like Washington, Oregon, Virginia and Georgia as the Latino populations in those places grow.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

That same trend could be emerging in urban parts of Texas, Saenz said.\n\n\"People have said it's highly desirable to have less racial polarization in voting. So Democrats may not like the election outcomes if they stop getting big majorities of the Latino vote. But from a more general perspective, is it good for democracy to have less racially polarized voting?\" Stephanopolous said. \"I think it is.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Spoiler: not many people did.\n\n(Note: The Venn Diagram in the video incorrectly identifies Brazil, French Guiana, Guadaloupe, Haiti, Martinique, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin as places that share the characteristics of both Latino and Hispanic populations. In fact, Brazilians would fit within the most widely accepted definition of \"Latino,\" but not \"Hispanic.\" Many argue that the French-speaking country of Haiti and territories of French Guiana, Guadaloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthélemy also belong to the region of Latin America, but their populations are not Hispanic. Saint Martin is a predominately Dutch-speaking Caribbean island with a sizable French-speaking minority, so most of its population is neither Latino nor Hispanic.)\n\nLuckily, Lazo explained how the terms differ. In short, \"Hispanic\" focuses on Spanish-speaking origin. This means Spain is included, but Brazil is not because Brazilians speak Portuguese. \"Latino\" refers to people of Latin American origin. This includes Brazil and excludes Spain.\n\n\"Hispanic is basically based on whether you or your family speak the language of Spanish whereas Latino is focusing more on geographic location, that being Latin America,\" Lazo said in the video.\n\nOne man on the streets of New York helped Lazo with her explanation when he talked about his experience with the term \"Spanish.\" \"I hate when people call me Spanish because I'm not,\" he said. \"If you're Spanish it's because you're from Spain.\"\n\nIt's important to note that just because people speak Spanish, it doesn't mean they're Spanish. It's a language, and it's also a term referring to nationality.\n\nAnd there you have it. They may just be three words, but they pack quite a meaningful punch.\n\nH/T Cosmo for Latinas\n\nAlso on The Huffington Post:\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "21 Stereotypes About Latino Men That Latino Men Want To Dispel\n\nAssociate Editor, The Huffington Post\n\nOver the past few weeks, we've reached out to you , the men of our community, to find out what stereotypes Latino men are sick and tired of hearing . Below are 21 responses that range from the obvious to HEAR THAT, TRUMP?!\n\n1. \" Latinos are bad or absent dads. The majority are present, hard-working and tender with their children.\"\n\n2. \" Latino men ... don't stand on boxes and scream at the top of their lungs. Latino men are quiet. They get up and go to work. They provide for their families, with the help of their wives, of course. They work in offices, they work in hospitals, they wear a uniform. Some pick the fruit we eat, some pack it. Some wear suits. Some are still going to school so they could provide a good life for their family. A Latino man wants to hug his children every day, kiss his wife and live a good life. A Latino man is no different than any other man of any ethnicity. \"\n\n3. \" That we're uneducated .\"\n\n\"Can we move away from the idea that all Latino men fit into this machismo, misogynist, patriarchal mold?\"\n\n4. \" That we're lazy .\"\n\n5. \"That we're incapable of being loved .\"\n\n6. \"That we are all macho, and deserve, expect or enjoy being waited on by women. That we all love sports. That we can all dance.\"\n\n7. \" Can we move away from the idea that all Latino men fit into this machismo, misogynist, patriarchal mold? We're feminists! Allies! Trailblazers! And so much more!\"\n\n8. \" That by having an education, you have rejected your culture, values and traditions to become 'white washed.' Why would we reject it? We have one of the most unique cultures in the world, with each country being a little distinct in Latin America.\"\n\n9. \" That all Latino men are homophobes. \"\n\n10. \"That we're all about that machismo, hood-rat life and lack intelligence .\"\n\n11. \"I'm not hood or gangster. I believe my wife is equal to me. I'm tired of my own culture/family/friends telling me that as a man my opinion is the only one that matters. I married my wife because she's equal to me, not dependent on me. \"\n\n12. \"That all Latino men that have tattoos are in gangs or were in prison. \"\n\n\"I married my wife because she's equal to me, not dependent on me.\"\n\n13. \" That if you don't speak English, you're undocumented. \"\n\n14. \" That we are drunks, illegals, only good for cleaning, womanizers, uneducated, gang affiliated who have not contributed to this society. \"\n\n15. \" That Latinos are lazy, dumb, deadbeat dads, illegal immigrants, school drop-outs, gang members, drug dealers, rapists ... That Latinos will turn America into a third world country. \"\n\n16. \"That we all speak 'Mexican.' \"\n\n17. \"That we beat our women to death. \"\n\n18. \"That we all look like the guys from Cypress Hill. \"\n\n19. \"I am not a backwards thinking, 'man is king' kinda guy. I do not believe a woman's only place is in the kitchen or making babies. I want a partner, not a servant. I actually get myself ready in the morning without any help. I do not need to drink to have a good time. Sorry, Spanish isn't my first language. I was actually born in the U.S. I actually can count past 10. I can be strong and compassionate. I have not been to prison. Just because you think I look dirty doesn't mean that I can't process higher-level thoughts. I believe that my daughters do not need a man to achieve high social standing. \"\n\n\"I can be strong and compassionate.\"\n\n20. \"That we are all jealous and possessive. \"\n\n21. \"Gangs are present in every neighborhood in the United Sates. Some exist out of necessity or fraternity, while others exist because of crime and drugs. However, the assumption that all Latino men are in or have been in a gang is an incredible lie. We do not aspire to be in a criminal element. We try to prevent our youth from being sucked into that world. We work hard to show a better path towards the perception of success.

      "text": "Hollywood Is Still Portraying Latinos With The Same Tired Stereotypes\n\nSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn 2022, nearly 60% of Latino lead characters in Hollywood's top films were depicted as criminals. Forty percent were portrayed as angry, and more than 30% were sexualized. And more than a quarter were presented solely as the comic relief of their movie, often opposite a more three-dimensional white character. To add insult to injury, many of these characters are often portrayed as foreign, further otherizing and marginalizing Latinos in the U.S.\n\nThe persistence of these harmful stereotypes and tired tropes is among the many glaring findings of a new study on Latino representation in major Hollywood movies. Or more precisely, the report, from the University of Southern California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, is really about the persistent invisibility of Latinos on the big screen. That's despite 20% of Americans identifying as Hispanic/Latino in the latest U.S. Census. In Los Angeles, where many of the decisions for these movies get made, almost 50% of the population identifies as Hispanic/Latino.\n\nSince 2007, the group has collected data on the top 100 highest-grossing Hollywood films each year and broken down who is represented in front of and behind the camera. Their newest report, released Monday, is the third time the group has specifically drilled down on Latino representation - and virtually nothing has changed, according to the data. In fact, some of it, such as the prevalence of stereotypical Latino lead characters, has actually worsened in recent years, the group found.\n\nThe report suggests that too often, Latinos are either stereotyped in major movies, or they aren't on-screen at all. The report, which uses the census category of Hispanic/Latino for consistency, found that in 2022, only 5% of lead characters in the top 100 highest-grossing Hollywood movies were Hispanic/Latino, and 5.8% of all speaking characters were Hispanic/Latino. More than 40% of films in 2022 didn't have a single Hispanic/Latino character.\n\nThose numbers have barely moved since 2007, according to the data. One major exception was in 2021, the only year the percentage of Hispanic/Latino characters in top films exceeded 10%, thanks to the release of three big movies with Hispanic/Latino leads: \"West Side Story,\" \"In the Heights\" and \"Encanto.\"\n\n\"There is a clear and persistent lack of stories that center on Hispanic/Latino actors and the Hispanic/Latino experience,\" the report's lead author Ariana Case said in a press release. \"Despite the profusion of talent from this community, there is a clear reluctance on the part of the entertainment industry to develop and distribute these stories.\"\n\nThe numbers are even lower for Latinos with intersectional identities, such as Afro-Latinos, LGBTQ Latinos and disabled Latinos, showing a lack of variety and nuance when it comes to Latino stories from major Hollywood studios.\n\nThe persistent lack of progress on representation means that very few Latino stars and filmmakers get the chance to have any sort of career longevity in Hollywood. For example, from 2007 to 2022, only 14 lead or co-lead characters in major movies were played by Hispanic/Latino actors 45 years old and above, according to the group's data. Just five of those characters were women - and three of them were played by one actor: Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAs this kind of research perennially documents, the lack of representation on-screen goes hand in hand with a lack of representation behind the camera. In 2022, just 3.5% of directors of the top 100 highest-grossing movies were Hispanic/Latino, the study found. Those numbers are similarly low for other key decision-making roles on movies, such as producers and casting directors.\n\nHaving Latinos in positions of power makes a substantial difference. For instance, the researchers found that in films with Hispanic/Latino casting directors, Hispanic/Latinos filled 12.6% of speaking roles, compared to just 5.2% of roles in films with non-Hispanic/Latino casting directors.\n\nFinally, the study also took a closer look at what kinds of institutional support recent films with Hispanic/Latino leads have been getting. In 2021 and 2022, films with Hispanic/Latino leads had lower median production and marketing budgets compared to films with non-Hispanic/Latino leads. While Hispanic/Latino creators are tirelessly working to tell their stories, they often lack the institutional support and major platforms for their work.\n\nAs in previous years, the report ends with a wide array of solutions. They range from studios and production companies considering more Latino filmmakers for plum directing opportunities, to casting directors and talent agents championing Latino actors, to film festivals programming more Latino-led films and creating initiatives to support emerging Latino filmmakers, to philanthropists launching funds specifically for Latino-led projects. Or at the very least, more individuals with a lot of power in Hollywood should be putting their names and money behind projects from Latino filmmakers. Whatever the approach, the researchers repeatedly underscore that it's past time for any excuses for industry leaders' inaction.\n\n\"For the third time, we are imploring the industry to create change and authentically and meaningfully represent the Hispanic/Latino community in popular storytelling,\" they wrote in the report. \"Falling back on excuses, leaning into outdated stereotypes, and refusing to try are simply no longer acceptable. There are talented Hispanic/Latino filmmakers ready to work and compelling stories about Hispanic/Latinos to tell. It's time for gatekeepers to open the floodgates and bring them to our screens.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Latino Vote: \"The New Normal\"\n\nPresident and CEO, National Council of La Raza\n\nSince election night, one topic of immense interest to me has dominated the news cycle: the impact of the Latino vote on the 2012 election. After years of being treated as one of the best-kept secrets in politics, the need to reach out to Latino voters has suddenly become the hot topic of conversation for people on both sides of the aisle--even Sean Hannity . It has all the makings of not only a political phenomenon but a cultural phenomenon as well. In fact, if this were a sitcom, it would be called \"The New Normal.\" And this \"New Normal\" is not just about 2012; for several key reasons, our community's clout is only going to grow in every election from here on out.\n\nFirst, Latino voters have cemented themselves as a permanent part of the electorate. One reason why pundits who predicted a Romney landslide got it so wrong is that they assumed communities of color, and especially Latinos, would not vote at the same levels as they did in 2008. In fact, not only did Latino voters match their 2008 turnout, they surpassed it. We knew from our own surveys and analyses that Hispanic voters are deeply engaged in the political process and were very enthusiastic about participating in this year's contest. But now Latinos also know that they have a voice. That voice made a difference, and they intend to keep using it.\n\nSecond, the size of that voice is going in only one direction: up. The Hispanic electorate grew by 26% between 2008 and 2012 to just a hair under 12 million voters. But Latinos are still significantly underrepresented in the American electorate. Yes, it's true that only 50% of Hispanics over the age of 18 are registered to vote, but that is because a number of people are not yet citizens. Even so, there are 7.6 million Hispanic U.S. citizens eligible to vote who have not registered. No other significant group of voters, with the exception of voters ages 18 to 29, has such a gap. With real attention and real investment, these potential voters could be the low-hanging fruit for nonpartisan voter registration efforts.\n\nNot only has the Latino vote become a fast-growing permanent fixture in electoral politics, it is poised to permanently change the electoral map. There is no question that the growing presence of Hispanic voters has made states such as Colorado, Nevada, Florida, and even Virginia into perennial swing states, but the Latino vote could do the same in other states sooner than conventional wisdom anticipates.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Yet in both states the number of eligible Hispanics over 18 who are eligible, but not yet registered to vote is significant: as much as 400,000 in Arizona and more than two million in Texas. In essence, a fully registered Hispanic vote would put both of these states into play.\n\nHere's the bottom line for both parties and all those working to increase political participation in this country: the 2012 electorate, which includes millions of Hispanic voters, has become an American reality that should be embraced by all.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "What the Terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' Mean to Me\n\nTeam USA fencer, Olympic hopeful\n\nA friend of mine recently confided in me that she has no idea how to refer to brown people. Is it Latino or Hispanic and what's the difference? She also asked me if Hispanic is a derogatory term and are Brazilians Latino. There is a lot of confusion about this perhaps in part due to the historical significance of each term but perhaps also because language is alive and the terms that we use continue changing and reshaping as we use them.\n\nI would like to give you my perspective on this as a Latina and a Hispanic woman. First, to understand the contemporary meaning of each term and their psychological and emotional triggers, let's with their historical etymology.\n\nLatino and Hispanic are both colonial-ascribed terms that. Hispanic refers to people who are of Spanish-speaking descent or hispano-hablantes . Latino refers to people of Latin-colonized American descent, including Brazilians.\n\nHispanic is always linked to Spain and was a term developed in the 1970's by a United States Government Task Force set out to clarify and define racial and ethnic populations in the U.S. Latino is a longtime used term that has been used by Latinos to describe themselves. However, it was not until a 2000 United States Census that this term was widely-used on a government document. This lead to prolonged media and academic debate on the distinctions and proper use of each term as well as the effect that these terms may have in homogenizing a diverse population.\n\nIn this lies the root of each ethnonym. \"Hispanic\" is what linguists call an exonym or a term created to describe an ethnic group by an outside group. \"Latino\" is an endonym or a term created and used to describe a group by the group itself.\n\nIt is very telling that terms like Hispanic are often perceived as derogatory. It speaks volumes as to how Hispanics are depicted on the media, TV and in the political arena.\n\nGrowing up in Arizona, it was hard for me to relate to the term \"Hispanic\" where I often heard the word being used in a negative or demeaning way. I knew that I was supposed to check off \"Hispanic\" whenever I took a state test at school but it never felt right to call myself Hispanic. Then when I was around 10, I came across a magazine at my friend Lindsay's house called Latina Magazine . It was the first time I saw an entire publication celebrating Latina women. I saw girls with a whole range of complexions and Spanish phrases were included in the writing. My young mind was blown.\n\nAround the same time Jennifer Lopez starred in a movie called Selena . I remember feeling a fascinating discomfort in my 10-year-old body as I sat there in the theatre. There was an unspoken understanding that I and many other Hispanics in America understood very well at that time. That speaking Spanish and being \"out\" with my Latin American roots were things to hide as they could put me at a social and educational disadvantage and if you could pass as white then you did so without question.\n\nSo there I was in a theater where the Latino stars on the screen were playing a Mexican family, they were speaking Spanish and they were out and open about their culture for everyone in the theatre to see. I was excited but simultaneously embarrassed for them. I experienced conflicting emotions that I could not yet articulate because I did not have enough life experience to contextualize them.\n\nA couple of years later came Ricky Martin with his big hit \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" and Shakira followed suit soon after. I remember everyone calling them \"crossover artists\" and even that description felt so loaded. The New York City-based shows 106 and Park and TRL also began interviewing wide-eyed musicians who described themselves at \"Latino.\"\n\nAs I started seeing more and more positive Latino role-models who I could identify my identity and the esteem I had about my culture began to shift. I started to connect deeper within myself and I was not ashamed to speak Spanish in the mall or to listen to Ricardo Arjona with the volume pumped up. In short, I was not ashamed to be me.\n\nTo this day, I prefer to describe myself as Latina (Latino with an -o is a masculine term used to describe men) over hispanic. Perhaps for all of the reasons I mentioned or perhaps for reasons unknown. There is an online movement amongst bloggers and activists to use the gender neutral \"Latin@\" whose symbol at the end structurally encompasses both the -a and the -o.\n\nThen there are also people who prefer to use the gender-neutral and not quite geographically accurate yet widely understood terms \"Latin\" and \"Spanish\". Latino, Hispanic, Latin@, Spanish and Latin are all correct and non-derrogatory. However, while there might be a historical basis for race and ethnicity, they are both social constructs. People are so much more complex than their racial or ethnic identities, and we will always encounter issues when using terms that are supposed to neatly fit humans into groups.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

She joined Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, shortly after the state legislature passed the draconian \"show me your papers\" immigration law and started holding her own know your rights meetings around her community and knocking on doors to get rid of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nSenate Bill 1070, as its officially known, was the most punitive immigration law in the nation and gave rise to copycat legislation in other states. The bill, which was signed into law by former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, encouraged racial profiling by allowing police officers to question anyone deemed suspicious about their immigration status during any interaction, including routine traffic stops. State Senate President Russell Pearce, a powerful far-right lawmaker and architect of SB 1070, made his hostility toward immigrants his signature legislative issue - paving the way for Arpaio to use his department to make life so miserable for immigrants that they would rather flee the state.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nUnder his 24-year reign, which spanned from 1993 to 2016, Arpaio and his officers systematically targeted Latinos and people of color, used brutal policing policies, and were accused of far too many forms of misconduct to list. \"We had our own Trumpistas, or little Trumps, before Trump,\" Gallardo said.\n\n\"We experienced raids in our neighborhoods before raids were streamlined throughout the nation,\" she continued. \"Our people, Black and brown bodies, were being killed by police departments. That has been happening for many, many years. We saw our car washes getting raided, and workers, literally moms and dads, not being able to pick up their kids because they were arrested by Arpaio. We were able to experience all of that way before Trump was elected.\"\n\nGallardo is now a communications director of LUCHA, but back then she just wanted to learn her rights and know how to protect her family, in case they were ever pulled over on their way to church or the grocery store. \"It was a very scary time,\" she said. Whenever they missed a call on the home phone, she recalled, \"My first thought would be, 'Oh my God, my dad got pulled over.'\"\n\nGallardo was far from the only one who decided to stay in the state and transform the fear into energy. Arpaio, who became nationally known for workplace raids and neighborhood sweeps aimed at rounding up undocumented immigrants, seemed invincible. Pearce did too. But their yearslong crusade against immigrants had an unintended consequence: It ended up galvanizing an entire generation of Latinos and young progressives, who helped build a grassroots movement that would eventually push them out of office and transform the state's politics.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIf Arizona turns blue on Tuesday, it will be the result of relentless on-the-ground organizing and a yearslong effort to register voters by activists who have played a crucial role in some of the left's biggest political victories in the state. Unlike the Trump campaign, the Biden team avoided in-person canvassing for most of the year out of fear of spreading the coronavirus. But halting door-to-door efforts put the Democratic nominee at a disadvantage, and grassroots groups and activists have been filling in the void. While the pandemic has made in-person outreach harder, it has also been a motivating force, as Arizona's Latino communities are among the hardest hit by Covid-19.\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva, a progressive Democrat who has represented southern Arizona in Congress since 2003, believes that Democrats are poised to sweep the elections in his home state. \"Fourteen years ago, a decade ago, nobody would have imagined that,\" he told The Intercept in a phone interview, after spending most of the day campaigning with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Tucson.\n\n\"[SB 1070] was a watershed moment for the state of Arizona, in the sense that it was so raw and so politically motivated in terms of making the immigrant community and Latinos, by obvious association, the target that it backfired,\" Grijalva said. \"And it backfired in the sense that it politicized a lot of people and energized a generation of activists.\"\n\nGrijalva, who contracted Covid-19 in early August, added that the \"abject failure\" and \"incompetence\" of the Trump administration's pandemic response, along with the disproportionate infection rates among Latinos in the state, have been the major factors driving voters away from Trump.\n\nLeft/Top: Immigrant inmates show off a pair of pink underwear while sitting on a bunk in the Maricopa County Tent City jail in Phoenix, on March 11, 2013.

After the passage of SB 1070, a law Grijalva considered \"harsh\" and \"discriminatory,\" he suggested a limited boycott of the state to pressure lawmakers to reconsider the policy, comparing it to the boycott of Arizona in the 1990s when the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. As a result, the congressman received a wave of death threats, and the windows on his Yuma district office were shot out . He ended his call for a boycott when a federal judge halted key parts of SB 1070, but his reaction to the law made his 2010 reelection race, which should have been in the bag, the toughest of his entire career.\n\n\"Well, it became a thing that the whole political establishment, including many Democrats, unified around the idea that I was calling for economic sanctions against the state,\" he said. \"And over a million bucks - in those days that was a lot of money - from independent expenditure campaigns were against me.\"\n\nHe defeated his Republican challenger by less than 10,000 votes.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down portions of SB 1070 in 2012, but it didn't lose most of its power until 2016, as part of a settlement with the National Immigration Law Center and other immigrants' rights groups that sued after its passage.\n\nLUCHA (which means \"struggle\" or \"fight\" in Spanish) was formed in 2009 in response to SB 1070, but grew its political clout through the Arpaio fight. In 2016, the leaders of LUCHA, Puente, and Poder in Action, created the Bazta Arpaio campaign, joining forces with labor movement leaders, like AFL-CIO organizer Neidi Dominguez and AFGE organizer Joe Diggs. Bazta Arpaio, organizers said, led the largest get-out-the-vote canvassing effort in Arizona history, specifically mobilizing first-time Latino voters.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, the same day Donald Trump was elected, thousands of activists and volunteers celebrated the defeat of Arpaio in what local organizers described as a \"bittersweet moment.\"\n\nFormer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio poses for a photograph in front of his campaign vehicle as he runs for the position of Maricopa County sheriff again in Fountain Hills, Ariz., on July 22, 2020.\n\nArpaio, whom Trump pardoned in 2017, tried to get his old job back earlier this year but lost the Republican primary to his former Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan by about 6,000 votes, marking his third electoral defeat in four years. He also had an unsuccessful run for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018.\n\nLUCHA has knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in neighborhoods in South Phoenix, South Tucson, and West Phoenix since then. One Arizona, which is made up of 23 organizations, collectively registered 190,000 voters in 2018 and took on a similar goal this year. Many of these groups have been increasing their outreach efforts each year, creating a voter mobilization machine. With more than 1.63 million ballots cast two days before the election, voter turnout in Maricopa County has already surpassed 2016 levels, according to election officials.\n\nGroups like Mijente, Chispa AZ, and Mi Familia Vota, which were part of the coalition One Arizona, have also been crucial in building to the current moment. Mijente was also a product of the SB 1070 fight and Arpaio era.\n\n\"The kids of the parents who Joe Arpaio and Russell Pearce terrorized through SB 1070 are the same kids that are voting for the first time,\" Gallardo said. \"And you better know that they remember what their parents went through. They're voting out Trump, they're going door-to-door getting other people out to vote, and you see just a tremendous force of young people that you've seen throughout this decade really leading the fight here in Arizona.\"\n\nSome of the Latino activists who were actively involved in the fight against these anti-immigrant policies -  like Phoenix City Council member Carlos Garcia and Democratic state Rep. Raquel Terán - sensed their power and decided to run for elected office. Garcia, a Mexican American immigrant and founder of the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona, protested Arpaio and has been arrested several times protesting deportations - a background not typically seen in Arizona's local elected officials. Terán, who was active in the successful recall effort against Pearce, won a seat in the state legislature in 2018.\n\nLeft/Top: A protester shouts at a riot police officer before being arrested at a demonstration against Arizona's immigration enforcement law SB 1070 on July 29, 2010 in Phoenix.

Photo: John Moore/Getty Images; Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images\n\nThe wave of Latino activism that emerged in response to Arpaio and the state's racist policies, combined with long-lasting demographic changes, has accelerated Arizona's political transformation from a Republican bastion to an increasingly purple state. Alicia Contreras, executive director of CORAZÓN Arizona, a faith-based community group, said that the state's political shift is a result of \"our blood, sweat, and tears, out there on the field, registering voters and educating folks.\"\n\nIn 2020 alone, LUCHA has made nearly 3 million calls to get out the vote. LUCHA's sister organization, the Arizona Center for Empowerment, has been focusing on a civic engagement campaign that recently registered 47,000 new voters. UNITE HERE, the union representing hospitality workers, has been knocking on doors in the desert heat, which the Biden campaign and party avoided doing for most of the season. Biden's team is aiming to win at least 70 percent of Latino voters in the state.\n\nWith 11 electoral votes and a U.S. Senate seat on the line, Arizona has become one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. It's a must-win for Trump, who captured the state by a margin of 3.5 percentage points in 2016. No Republican has ever won the presidency without Arizona. It's possible, but it hasn't been done and the path would be very narrow. The most recent polling averages suggest that Biden is ahead by about 2.8 points. Though Biden has not traveled to the state as much as Trump has, the state has attracted tens of millions of dollars from both sides, making Phoenix one of the biggest advertising markets in the presidential race.\n\nCORAZÓN Arizona has been holding socially distanced canvassing sessions, phone-banking events, and text banking leading up to the election. \"Yes, there's a candidate that is more aligned and willing to support our values,\" she said. \"But we understand that we still have to do work. It does not stop on November 3.\"\n\nIris Acosta, right, a laid-off hospitality worker and member of UNITE HERE Local 11, talks to Phoenix resident Christopher Lowe, as Acosta canvasses the suburbs of Phoenix, on Oct. 15, 2020.\n\nThe race between moderate Democrat Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, and Republican Sen. Martha McSally, could potentially decide the balance of power in the Senate. In recent weeks, Kelly has opened an even bigger lead over McSally and dramatically outraised the incumbent, raising more than $83 million, compared with her $50 million. McSally was appointed to the seat previously held by the late Sen. John McCain in 2018, after losing a race for the other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Democrats also have good chances of taking the state House and breaking up the Republican trifecta. They only need to win two House seats. While it's much less likely that Democrats flip both the state House and Senate, their chances of recapturing the legislature are better than they have ever been.\n\nIn Arizona, Latinos make up about a quarter of the state's electorate, and increased turnout among the demographic contributed to Sinema's 2.3 margin of victory in 2018. More than 103,000 Latinos in Arizona reached voting age between 2018 and 2020 alone, according to a Mi Familia Vota report . Nationally, Latino voters are projected to be the largest nonwhite voting bloc for the first time in history.\n\nThough Biden has consistently held a significant lead over Trump among Latino voters, Trump's reelection campaign has been aggressively courting Latino male voters in states like Arizona and Florida, and appears to be siphoning a bit of Biden's support. A recent poll from the New York Times found that the former vice president leads among Latina voters by 34 percentage points, but only 8 points among men.\n\n\"I've been thinking a lot about that lately,\" Grijalva said about the gender gap. \"Just like with white males, and particularly with second- and third-generation Chicanos,\" he believes, these voters have drifted toward Trump because \"that's the only way they can express their sense of losing dominance, and it's unfortunate.\"\n\nBiden's struggle to appeal to Latino voters stretch back to the Democratic primary, when he lost young Latino voters overwhelmingly to Sen. Bernie Sanders across several Western states. He's caught up since then, but still lags behind Hillary Clinton's 2016 level of support in some states. Even after clinching the nomination, the Biden campaign was slow to prioritize Latino voter outreach.\n\nCorrection: November 2, 2020, 8:14 p.m. ET A photo caption referred to Iris Acosta as a Democratic Party activist.

      "text": "Bernie Sanders's Secret to Attracting Latino Support: Talking to Them\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA crucial state could be delivered to the Sanders campaign by a surge in Latino turnout.\n\nJust before noon on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio stood on the sidelines of a soccer tournament eating elote. De Blasio, who dropped out of the presidential race in September, had endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president the Friday before and spent the holiday weekend stumping for him in Nevada, stopping by the small tournament at a Las Vegas high school to test out a few Spanish phrases on the players.\n\nOne of many events dubbed \"Unidos con Bernie,\" the campaign-organized tournament was held on the the east side of the city, home to the largest Latino population in the state and the campaign's first Nevada field office.\n\nTo conclude the Presidents' Day festivities - which featured tacos, paletas, and a trophy for the champions - campaign staff and volunteers drove the few dozen young participants to nearby early caucus sites.\n\nDanny Parra, a 19-year-old student who played in the tournament, told The Intercept that he's voting for Sanders specifically because of the campaign's consistent outreach. He added that he doesn't really \"follow politics,\" but became interested in Sanders because he was always seeing the campaign's \"little stands\" on his community college campus.\n\n\"I appreciate that we're getting looked upon because that doesn't happen really in presidential elections,\" Parra said. \"I just think it's really cool he's looking out for us, trying to take care of us, like we have a voice too, like we may be small but every vote counts. It's just something I really appreciate from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nThough Sanders has polled favorably among Latino voters throughout the 2020 primary, his popularity with the electorate, which helped carry him to a wide popular-vote victory in Iowa , has surged in the lead-up to the Nevada caucuses - by one poll, he has over 60 percent of the Latino vote.\n\nThe campaign, which has knocked on more than 200,000 doors in Nevada in the past 17 days, is also getting organizing help from two major Latino groups. Mijente and Make the Road Action, an immigrant rights group, have thrown their support behind Sanders with their first-ever presidential endorsements, and each has a significant ground presence.\n\nAnd out of all the Democratic candidates running for the nomination, Latinos gave the most political donations to Sanders, contributing almost $8.3 million to the campaign in 2019, according to an analysis of campaign finance data by Plus Three, a technology company. The analysis, first reported by NBC News last week, found that 36 percent of Latinos' dollars went to the democratic socialist.\n\nTop/Left: Chuck Rocha, a senior Sanders adviser, broadcasts from the soccer tournament to his social media followers. Center: David Crow displays pins from his Bernie Bus. Bottom/Right: Laura Becerra, the Latinx constituency organizer for the Sanders campaign, holds up the winning trophy for the tournament. Photos: Krystal Ramirez for The Intercept\n\nBut Sanders does face a hurdle in his effort to win over Latinos in the state: the leadership of the powerful Culinary Union, which represents many Vegas casino workers. The Culinary Union - aka Unite Here Local 226 - has been escalating its attacks against Sanders over his support of Medicare for All. Those attacks initially singled out both Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have endorsed Medicare for All, but the fire has been trained solely on Sanders as the caucuses approach. With English- and Spanish-language flyers, texts, and emails to its 60,000 members, leaders warned that Medicare for All would \"end Culinary health care.\"\n\nThen, following outcry from progressives, the union accused Sanders supporters of \"viciously\" attacking the group, saying that they were flooded with threatening phone calls, emails, and messages. Two top Culinary officials shared examples of the kind of harassment they received with the Nevada Independent , but at least one - a commenter on a Nevada Independent article that referred to members of the Culinary Union as \"illegals\" - had also made anti-Sanders comments, a fact that was not originally included in the article. When asked for specific examples of harassment from Sanders supporters, union spokesperson Bethany Khan told The Intercept that most are with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \"as we are in the process of filing a report, so not being shared at this time,\" adding that she has also begun to post some on her personal social media account.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAt a presidential forum with Culinary Union workers on Tuesday night, Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, both of whom are polling abysmally with Latinos, made a last-minute pitch for their support. Culinary secretary-treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline opened by talking about \"terrible attacks from Senator Sanders's followers.\" Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who couldn't make it to the event because of a CNN town hall, told the workers in a prerecorded video that he stands with them \"whether it is bullies online or bullies in the White House.\"\n\nIn one of the most cringeworthy campaign moments so far, Klobuchar opened her address to the Culinary workers by telling the predominantly Latinx audience: \"My name is Amy, but when I took Spanish in fourth grade, my name was Elena.\" She added that she was given the name because she couldn't roll her R's. There are no R's in \"Amy,\" and the anecdote, which drew blank stares from the audience, was also relentlessly mocked online.\n\nWarren leaned heavily into women's rights issues, telling the audience, many of whom work as housekeepers, that the White House is a mess and \"when you've got a mess and you really need it cleaned up, you call a woman and get the job done,\" deploying an unusually gender-normative punchline for a candidate who has been highly conscious of the politics of her language.\n\nAfter the event, Maira Acasada Tatum, a housekeeper at the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas, said she was probably going to caucus for Warren because of her stance on raising the federal minimum wage. \"I have kids and go into work and only make $8, $9 an hour,\" she said, adding that she doesn't know who her second choice is yet. When asked about her thoughts on Medicare for All, she replied in Spanish that she didn't understand it very well.\n\nLuis Vásquez, regional director for the Bernie Sanders campaign, at the campaign's East Las Vegas Office on Feb 17, 2020.\n\nFor the first time, Nevada is holding several days of early voting ahead of its February 22 caucuses in an effort to make the election process more accessible. At these early-voting locations, where same-day registration is allowed, participants fill out a ballot using ranked-choice voting, selecting at least three and up to five of their top Democratic candidates. According to the state's Democratic Party , more than 36,000 people participated in the first three days of early caucus voting, and 56 percent of the people who turned out on Saturday were first-time caucus-goers. On the final day of voting, Tuesday, a staggering 33,000 waited in long lines to caucus. Only 84,000 total voted in the 2016 caucuses, which did not include early voting.\n\nOne poll, conducted by the progressive think tank Data for Progress, found that 66 percent of Hispanic voters in Nevada support Sanders. No other candidate made it out of the single digits. And last week, a Morning Consult poll showed the democratic socialist with a staggering lead among Hispanic voters, jumping 10 points with the demographic the day after winning the New Hampshire primary. According to the poll, Sanders had the highest support among the group at 48 percent, followed by Mike Bloomberg at 17 percent and a distant Joe Biden at 13 percent. But a new Telemundo poll found Sanders and Biden in a virtual tie for the state's Latino vote. Biden had a narrow lead at 34 percent to Sanders's 31 percent, with a margin of error of 4 percentage points.\n\nBiden, who's counting on black voters in South Carolina to save his chances at the nomination, has been struggling to win over Latino voters, which will almost certainly hurt his chances in states like California and Texas, two delegate-rich states with the largest Latino populations in the country, as well as in Nevada. The former vice president has for the most part refused to grapple with Barack Obama's history of being the \"deporter in chief,\" as the head of the National Council of La Raza declared him in 2014. He's received fierce backlash from immigrant rights activists and up until this weekend, repeatedly refused to apologize for the harm inflicted by the Obama administration's deportation machine, instead implying that he internally opposed the policy. Outside of a Las Vegas campaign event Tuesday, a group of activists confronted him for not committing to stopping all deportations.\n\nFor the first time, in an interview with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos on Saturday, Biden called it a \"big mistake\" to have deported hundreds of thousands of people without a criminal record. \"We took far too long to get it right,\" Biden told Ramos, then adding, \"it was a big mistake\" and the administration \"took too long to get it right.\"\n\nButtigieg, Warren, and Klobuchar also have teams dedicated to Latino outreach, but the candidates' efforts pale in comparison to Sanders and in some cases, have backfired. During an interview with Spanish-language station Telemundo last week, both Klobuchar and billionaire Tom Steyer couldn't name the president of Mexico. The Minnesota senator admitted that she didn't know his name while Steyer said he \"forgot.\" (Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador also goes by the initials \"AMLO.\") With the caucuses just three days away, Klobuchar, a famously difficult boss, hasn't filled basic positions , including hiring a \"Nevada operations director.\" Steyer's strategy, meanwhile, has been to pump $14.7 million into the state and flood the airwaves with ads.\n\nAs for the Warren campaign's Nevada field operation, a half-dozen women of color departed the 70-person team with complaints of a \"toxic work environment\" in the run-up to the caucuses, Politico reported . According to the women, the problems within the campaign hurt their broader efforts to engage Latinos. Spanish-language literature arrived late, \"there were too few Spanish-speaking organizers\" despite requests to hire more, and \"they felt it was a constant battle to set up events in Spanish.\"\n\nVoters, volunteers, and staff cheer during an event at the Bernie Sanders East Las Vegas Office on Feb 17, 2020.\n\n\"Tío Bernie,\" as many of his Latino supporters affectionately call him, owes much of his success to the campaign's outreach efforts. His policy positions, particularly involving issues like health care and economic justice, contribute to the appeal, argued Deputy Nevada Field Director Michael Ramirez. But the campaign made the decision to prioritize Latino outreach since the beginning, Chuck Rocha, a senior Sanders adviser, said, breaking with the traditional Democratic strategy of focusing on likely voters - which typically means white and older voters - then scrambling for Latino support in the final stretch.\n\n\"We started talking to people in Spanish here before we started talking to people in English, so to me that's very intentional organizing showing the community that we respect them, that we're going to be here, and that we're not going to leave,\" said Rocha. The Democratic Party's decadeslong failure to activate Latino voters has created a self-feeding cycle of disengagement: Candidates and campaigns don't expect them to vote so they don't bother asking them to, or at least not on the scale necessary for significant mobilization. Latino voters, poised to be the largest nonwhite eligible voting bloc in 2020, are crucial to winning the presidency and have been playing a key role in Sanders's rise.\n\n\"So I think that's the key to our success, is that we knew that Bernie Sanders was popular with Latinos,\" Rocha continued. \"But we had never really done the deep-dive organizing within the community, making sure that they knew everything about him so they can go tell their friends and their neighbors. And that's a big part of what you're seeing today with this soccer tournament, there's community-based events, which are key. But community-based events alone will not win you the elections - spending lots of money to talk to lots of Latinos is how you win the elections.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

It's been this way for the 29-year-old since she was first diagnosed with asthma as a child. Her symptoms typically rear up in the spring, when the high desert around California's Salton Sea starts to warm, and the dust begins to blow.\n\nBut Covid-19 was something else.\n\n\"This is probably the worst breathing issue that I've ever had,\" Rodriguez said. The virus spread to her lungs and caused pneumonia, which sent her to the hospital. \"It's like you're just struggling so bad. Just to get a good full breath of air.\"\n\nCovid-19 hit her family this June, spreading quickly from her older brother, to her sister and her young child, to her dad and then finally to Rodriguez. She got the worst of it.\n\nAlexis Rodriguez, right, with the printed mask, and her family members, all of whom contracted Covid-19, at their home in El Centro, Calif., on July 10, 2020.\n\nRespiratory illnesses are no stranger to the Latino communities who live around California's largest lake, the Salton Sea. Asthma rates here are some of the highest in California, with air quality routinely failing to meet federal and state standards. Thanks in part to the state's omnipresent water wars , the water in this desolate, former vacation destination is rapidly drying up, salinating the lake, and releasing decades-old contaminants into the air.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The Coronavirus Crisis\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe community already beset by an environmental disaster is now facing a pandemic of the worst proportions. Residents and activists, who have long fought for more funding and pollution mitigation, say the area was already at a steep disadvantage for health care. Now the largely agrarian community has found itself in the middle of a perfect storm of environmental neglect, poverty, and the coronavirus.\n\nAs Covid-19 cases resurge across the U.S., the numbers have been stark in the Golden State. Heralded for fast-moving lockdowns that helped thwart maxed-out hospitals at the beginning of the crisis, California is now breaking single-day case records .\n\nThe communities near the Salton Sea are some of the state's hardest hit. To the north, the Eastern Coachella Valley has the largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths of any of Riverside County's districts - and Riverside has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state, aside from Los Angeles. Across the lake to the south, adjacent Imperial County has also emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot, with the highest death rate in California. The main hospital there is so overrun, they've turned to using portable military-style tents in the triple-digit heat. Nearly all admitted patients are suffering from Covid-19.\n\n\"Covid is a leech. It thrives in these conditions, that's why you've seen the spike here,\" said Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, a veteran environmental justice group based in Imperial Valley. \"We experience it everyday. People are dying, getting sick, and having permanent scarring.\"\n\nOasis and Mecca, two of the gritty towns that dot the receding banks of the Salton Sea, were once aptly named. Created by accident in 1905 after a failed levee dumped fresh water from the Colorado River into the formerly bone-dry basin, the sea was a true desert wonder. In the mid-20th century, it became a family resort, appealing to residents looking for a break from the hustle of Los Angeles, a three-hour drive to the West. Vacationers came for water sports and to fish the stocked corvina.\n\nIn the 1970s, there was a dramatic shift . Runoff from neighboring farmland that flowed untreated into the sea, paired with swiftly salinating waters due to limited new water supply, led to mass fish die-offs. Algae in the lake, feeding off the decay, turned the water freakish shades of green and red. Then a pungent smell began.\n\nThe view from the south shore of the Salton Sea on May 11, 2018.\n\nBut nothing exacerbated the issue more than the 2003 approval of a multimillion-dollar transfer of water to San Diego: the largest farm-to-urban water agreement in U.S. history. It diverted water from the Colorado River that was previously available for use in the valley, dwindling runoff to the lake. Critics say the benefits from the deal haven't trickled down. The water barons in the region - the wealthy farmers who hold original water claims in the valley - were equally opposed to the transfer. About 500 farms control the rights to nearly 3.1 million acre-feet a year of water from the Colorado River. Contrastingly, nearly a quarter of Imperial County lives in poverty. Per capita income from 2018 was approximately $17,500, according to the latest census figures.\n\nMany Imperial Valley residents are tied to a massive agriculture sector that's responsible for producing the majority of the U.S's winter crops.\n\n\"I like to call it the last plantation. You have enormously wealthy white farmers and you have really poor people,\" said Malissa McKeith, a lawyer at the nonprofit advocacy group Citizens United for Resources and the Environment. She fought for years against the water transfer agreement, pushing for at least a quarter billion dollars to be set aside to build hospitals and increase medical services for future environmental impacts on residents, to no avail.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

It will keep shrinking, and the toxic dust laced with arsenic and fertilizer will be more and more exposed. The lake has already retreated a football field's length in parts, revealing crumbling banks made of petrified barnacles and dead fish exoskeletons. It's littered with dead birds, recognizable only by their residual feathers.\n\nFor McKeith, it's unsurprising how hard Covid-19 has hit the community, considering the particulate matter that continues to blow from the sea.\n\n\"You're starting out with people who have such compromised respiratory systems,\" she said. \"This situation may finally wake people up to the environmental Chernobyl they created, by allowing so much water to go to rich communities without addressing the Salton Sea.\"\n\nAfter responding to a call deemed a highly possible case of Covid-19, firefighters in El Centro, Calif., transport a patient experiencing pain and an elevated heart rate on July 17, 2020.\n\nNearly 50 percent of Riverside County and 84 percent of Imperial County are Hispanic, according to state and census estimates. Many Latino communities in the counties lack access to basic health care and have health conditions such as asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Families frequently live together in multigenerational homes. Many also work in essential jobs as farm pickers, prison workers, and nurses. Most can't afford to take sick leave, let alone move elsewhere.\n\nResearch has linked polluted air - which Latinos in the U.S. are more likely to breathe than white people - with a higher likelihood of death from Covid-19. Exposure to poor or cramped living conditions and comorbidities are also believed to exacerbate infection rates and worsen outcomes. In California, the risk to Latino communities is clear. Latinos make up an outsized portion of Covid-19 cases, accounting for 55.6 percent of cases and 45.2 percent of deaths in the state, despite being approximately 39 percent of the population.\n\nAnna Rosas, 34, a registered nurses assistant who works the night shift at the El Centro Regional Medical Center in Imperial, feels pangs of guilt over the death of her husband (and high school sweetheart) Luis Rosas.\n\n\"I can't help, you know, to maybe feel that it was my fault,\" she said.\n\nAs a health care professional for the past 13 years, Rosas had a heightened awareness of Covid-19's spread in her community. She washed her hands, wore masks, and limited her outings. \"My husband would make fun of it. He would be like, 'Oh, well, when you come home from work, I'm gonna have to hose you down,'\" she said.\n\nBut by the time she joined her sister-in-law's Mother's Day celebration on May 10, along with six other close family members, she was feeling ill.\n\nWhen Rosas later tested positive, she isolated herself in her home, pushing Luis and their 8-year-old son to move in with his sister, who at the time was living with her girlfriend, her parents, and her brother in a three-bedroom apartment. Within a week, nearly the entire family had symptoms.\n\nWhile Rosas was able to avoid the hospital, her sister-in-law and mother-in-law were later admitted and intubated. Rosas's 33-year-old brother-in-law died at home. After three weeks in the ICU, her husband also passed away. He was 37 years old. Her husband had weight and heart issues, as did other members of his family.\n\n\"I wish I would have definitely isolated myself, coming to work and not coming home. Because, me being a worker at the hospital, I wish I really definitely would have done that,\" Rosas said. \"It's hard though. I've never been separated from my husband in my life.\"\n\n\"Riverside County only knows the Eastern Coachella Valley exists because it's on a map,\" said Maria Pozar, a stay-at-home mother in the tight-knit unincorporated community of North Shore. Located just off the banks of the Sea, the neighborhood consists largely of mobile homes. At least 84 people there have contracted Covid-19.\n\nPozar is considered the unofficial mayor of the town, a role she stepped into when mothers at the sewing classes she taught began voicing concerns about their kids' frequent nosebleeds - attributable to the sea. Now she's concerned about the increase in Covid-19 cases, which she blames on the county's decision to reopen too early. Riverside County voted unanimously on May 12 to approve a plan for reopening businesses, despite evidence of growing cases in the Eastern Coachella Valley. Two weeks later, cases more than tripled. Imperial County similarly moved to reopen in early June, despite having the highest rate of Covid-19 cases in the state at the time.\n\nThe virus's attack on the southern California desert communities has rubbed salt in festering wounds of inequality.\n\n\"The government has a responsibility to take care of everyone,\" said Olmedo of Comite Civico del Valle, who grew up in Imperial Valley. \"We need to be able to stabilize the exposed area [around the sea]. We're not talking about natural dust from undisturbed areas. This has been a sump for industrial waste, and municipal waste. There's no way to sugarcoat this. It's been a site for a military proving ground. We don't know what's under the sea. What we do know, is we don't want it exposed.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom visited the Salton Sea area in 2018, agreeing that the region was at its \"tipping point.\" In June, the state legislature appropriated $47 million to help the Salton Sea. Some, including Olmedo, view the moment with a glimmer of hope.\n\nLuis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, at Red Hill Bay by the Salton Sea on July 10, 2020.\n\nIn order for residents to survive amongst the bleak dregs of the lake, Olmedo said he and others must let go of past resentments, accept that the water has been sold, and focus on mitigating the two main crises now facing the region: climate change and Covid-19. That means working in tandem with some of the government officials that locals have long felt were against them, being viewed as laborers and little more.\n\n\"We have a 100-year-old playbook here where the pioneers came here and they 'found' Imperial. Clearly those of us who are Latino, Mexicano, and Native American, we never really had any power. It was stripped away from us. So we have these carried-over sentiments. But now we have these bigger issues that affect everyone,\" Olmedo said. \"This crisis that is here, is in the center of our community and nothing else matters.\"\n\nThis article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nCorrection, July 28 4:03 p.m. EST: This piece has been updated to clarify the terms of the 2003 water transfer agreement between Imperial Valley and San Diego.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Tyson Foods Tapped Latino Civil Rights Group for Pandemic PR\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTyson, facing lawsuits over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, tapped LULAC for a publicity push over its safety record.\n\nOver the summer, after months of negative headlines about widespread Covid-19 infections and deaths among its heavily immigrant workforce, the meat industry seemed to reach a turning point.\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens, a storied civil rights group for Latinos, paid a carefully choreographed visit to the headquarters of Tyson Foods, one of the largest meatpacking corporations. And from the outside, it looked like Tyson had responded to concerns that the company had not done enough to protect its predominantly Black, Asian, and Latino workforce from infection.\n\nLULAC put out a press release on July 17 saying that its officials, including National President Domingo Garcia, traveled to Springdale, Arkansas, met with Tyson Foods chief executive Noel White at company headquarters and tour a Tyson-owned poultry plant in the city known as the Berry Street facility. During the meeting, LULAC said, the group spoke with White about a \"series of community demands,\" including free testing for all workers, adequate protective equipment, line speed to labor adjustments, and assistance to families who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus.\n\nGarcia posed with Tyson executives for a photo, and the group published it, along with other photos from the tour, in the press release . In the statement, LULAC praised the company for going beyond \"the CDC and OSHA's recommended procedures\" and declared that the firm \"is making significant changes and investments to improve worker safety and America's food supply.\"\n\nThis was a public relations coup. LULAC is the biggest and oldest Latino civil rights group in the country, and Tyson Foods facilities have seen some of the worst and most extensive outbreaks in the country. Over the first six months of the virus reaching the United States, at least 8,500 Tyson employees working at plants in seven states tested positive for Covid-19, with more than 25 dead - a fatality rate more than double other large slaughterhouse companies. Critics claim the firm moved slowly to provide safety equipment, coerced sick employees to continue showing up to work, and kept workers huddled elbow to elbow in conditions that fueled the spread of the virus.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe LULAC statement was featured prominently in a Tyson press release and in tweets outlining its commitment to worker safety. LULAC's praise of the food-processing giant has also appeared in other media outlets about the company's worker safety record, including a recent detailed investigation by The Guardian, which found few reforms and rampant infections at the Berry Street plant.\n\nTyson has also long served as a corporate sponsor of LULAC.\n\nThe families of workers who have fallen ill and died from the coronavirus have filed lawsuits against the company, with multiple cases in Iowa and Texas. Tyson has sought to dismiss the lawsuits on grounds that the company followed all necessary safety standards. One of the most egregious allegations is contained in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Isidro Fernandez, an employee of the Tyson plant in Waterloo, Iowa, who died of complications from Covid-19. The lawsuit, filed earlier this year, was amended last week to accuse Tyson managers of ordering employees to come into work while privately betting money on the number of workers who would become sick from the deadly virus. The plant manager \"organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers,\" while other managers denied the existence of confirmed cases within the plant, according to the suit. Over a third of the facility's workforce contracted the disease.\n\nIn July, a coalition of activist groups filed a racial discrimination complaint against Tyson for failing to adhere to safety guidelines resulting in the spread of the coronavirus among its meat-processing workers. The complaint alleged that Tyson moved swiftly to protect the health and safety of its largely white corporate office, while doing little to stop the spread of the virus among its immigrant and nonwhite front-line slaughterhouse workers. (Latino workers at meat-processing plants accounted for 56 percent of cases reported in meat production plants in 21 states, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) As news broke about the racial discrimination complaint, spokespeople for Tyson referred reporters to LULAC's comments .\n\nWorkers wait in line to enter the Tyson Foods pork-processing plant in Logansport, Ind., on May 7, 2020.\n\nTyson Foods' ties to LULAC come at a time of crisis for the firm and its heavily immigrant workforce. Tyson has pushed hard to counter negative headlines regarding the pandemic and fend off an array of wrongful death lawsuits from the families of deceased workers. The company has taken out full-page advertisements in the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as online advertisements featuring nonwhite workers touting Tyson's commitment to health and safety.\n\nTyson has touted tens of millions of dollars in safety upgrades, bonuses for front-line workers, and new medical assistance for infected workers. The ads position the company as doing its part to both safeguard the nation's food supply and uphold worker safety.\n\nBut the ads do not tell the entire story. Despite claims to have carefully safeguarded workers' health, the recent wave of lawsuits and other documents paint a different picture. Far from prioritizing U.S. meat supply, investor reports show that as the pandemic hit, companies such as Tyson increased meat exports to foreign markets, including China.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The Coronavirus Crisis\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nTyson Foods did not respond to a request for comment. Garcia, the head of LULAC, said that his organization is committed to improving conditions at meatpacking plants. \"We were one of the first third parties allowed to inspect plants there in Springdale and talk to workers as well as the management regarding conditions at the plant,\" he said in an interview with The Intercept.\n\nGarcia explained that his group connected to Tyson through Nora Venegas, a Tyson lobbyist who serves on an advisory board for LULAC.\n\n\"All the meatpacking plants and the poultry plants were grossly unprepared for Covid,\" said Garcia, who blamed the early outbreak not on any individual company, but on a \"total lack of national leadership on this very dangerous condition.\" The CDC, he noted, \"was telling everybody not to wear a mask.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that Tyson provides $25,000 a year to LULAC, along with several truckloads of charitable food donations. \"Our budget is over $1 million a year; nobody can buy our endorsement or support,\" Garcia said.\n\nBut Garcia's moves have disappointed some LULAC supporters, including one local LULAC leader who asked for anonymity in order to criticize the national leadership. \"The donations have created blinders on this issue,\" the LULAC leader said. \"I think it's difficult for LULAC to understand, someone has put some rose-colored glasses on them. You can see what's going on with this tap dance. These plants are causing chaos for communities. It's a death march for the workers.\"\n\nRelated Meat Industry Campaign Cash Flows to Officials Seeking to Quash Covid-19 Lawsuits\n\nThe timeline of events also undermines the narrative that Tyson followed CDC recommendations.\n\nIn Iowa, Pedro Cano Rodriguez, a 51-year-old worker at a pork plant in Columbus Junction, became symptomatic on April 2, was hospitalized for symptoms related to Covid-19 on April 10, and died four days later.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed by his children, at the time when Rodriguez first developed symptoms, Tyson failed to provide personal protective equipment, dividers, or physical barriers between line workers, and did nothing to encourage employees to remain six feet apart.\n\nJose Angel Chavez, who worked at a Tyson plant in Texas for over 20 years, died on April 17 after contracting Covid-19 earlier that month. His family filed a lawsuit against the company in June, saying that Tyson failed to provide a safe working environment when the pandemic began. The lawsuit claimed that Tyson Foods didn't take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the virus at its facilities, failing to distance workers, provide PPE like face masks and gloves, and notify staff of infections or tell them to stay home when sick. In early August, Chavez's family dropped the suit.\n\nEarly in the crisis, the government provided warnings and precautions for protecting worker safety. On March 9, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued guidance calling for all employers to establish flexible hours, maintain physical distance among employees, and use various PPE to guard against the spread of the virus.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit contrasts the working conditions of Rodriguez's plant with preventative measures by Tyson's central office. In early March, Tyson suspended commercial business travel for executives and forbade all nonessential visitors from entering Tyson corporate offices. On March 17, White, the Tyson CEO, instructed corporate employees to work from home. On March 20, Tyson executive Stephen Stouffer assured suppliers that Tyson's \"beef and pork facilities continue to operate at or very near normal production rates.\"\n\nDo you have a coronavirus story you want to share? Email us at coronavirus@theintercept.com or use one of these secure methods to contact a reporter.\n\nAs the crisis continued to grow, with outbreaks in slaughterhouses across the country, Tyson faced increasing demands by local health officials to shut down operations.\n\nIn April, President Donald Trump issued an executive order using the Defense Production Act to compel meat plants to remain open. Emails later showed that the order was partially drafted by lobbyists from the North American Meat Institute, a trade group supported by major meat industry companies, including Tyson, Smithfield Foods, and JBS.\n\nDespite its public announcements of radical investments in worker safety, Tyson has conceded that the company still has not implemented the CDC-recommended six-feet distancing recommendations. In response to an inquiry from Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., regarding the meat industry's response to the pandemic, Tyson stated in July that it was \"creating barriers and/or requiring face shields on production lines where social distancing is not possible.\"\n\nTyson has moved to dismiss the wrongful death lawsuits. Houston-based attorney Patrick O'Hara, who filed the lawsuit on the Chavez family's behalf, noted that the family has a 16-year-old daughter and have lost their main breadwinner because of the company's negligence.\n\nNavina Khanna, executive director of the HEAL Food Alliance, one of the plaintiffs in the racial discrimination complaint against Tyson, expressed disappointment that Tyson has done so much to refurbish its public image rather than change its business model.\n\n\"Instead of investing in their public image and in groups to improve their public image, they need to be investing in creating a safe place for their employees, actually paying their workers decent wages, and paying them for sick days so they don't have to show up for work if they have any symptoms,\" said Khanna.\n\n\"Put your money there and then you don't need to fight to make yourself look good. You look good by doing the right thing.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "If Arizona Goes Blue, Look to Joe Arpaio - and the Latinos Who Organized Against Him\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nYou can't understand how the state moved left without going back to the Maricopa County sheriff's racist policies.\n\nAbril Gallardo first became involved with grassroots organizing as a young undocumented student living in Arizona in 2010. She joined Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, shortly after the state legislature passed the draconian \"show me your papers\" immigration law and started holding her own know your rights meetings around her community and knocking on doors to get rid of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nSenate Bill 1070, as its officially known, was the most punitive immigration law in the nation and gave rise to copycat legislation in other states. The bill, which was signed into law by former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, encouraged racial profiling by allowing police officers to question anyone deemed suspicious about their immigration status during any interaction, including routine traffic stops. State Senate President Russell Pearce, a powerful far-right lawmaker and architect of SB 1070, made his hostility toward immigrants his signature legislative issue - paving the way for Arpaio to use his department to make life so miserable for immigrants that they would rather flee the state.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nUnder his 24-year reign, which spanned from 1993 to 2016, Arpaio and his officers systematically targeted Latinos and people of color, used brutal policing policies, and were accused of far too many forms of misconduct to list. \"We had our own Trumpistas, or little Trumps, before Trump,\" Gallardo said.\n\n\"We experienced raids in our neighborhoods before raids were streamlined throughout the nation,\" she continued. \"Our people, Black and brown bodies, were being killed by police departments. That has been happening for many, many years. We saw our car washes getting raided, and workers, literally moms and dads, not being able to pick up their kids because they were arrested by Arpaio. We were able to experience all of that way before Trump was elected.\"\n\nGallardo is now a communications director of LUCHA, but back then she just wanted to learn her rights and know how to protect her family, in case they were ever pulled over on their way to church or the grocery store. \"It was a very scary time,\" she said. Whenever they missed a call on the home phone, she recalled, \"My first thought would be, 'Oh my God, my dad got pulled over.'\"\n\nGallardo was far from the only one who decided to stay in the state and transform the fear into energy. Arpaio, who became nationally known for workplace raids and neighborhood sweeps aimed at rounding up undocumented immigrants, seemed invincible. Pearce did too. But their yearslong crusade against immigrants had an unintended consequence: It ended up galvanizing an entire generation of Latinos and young progressives, who helped build a grassroots movement that would eventually push them out of office and transform the state's politics.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIf Arizona turns blue on Tuesday, it will be the result of relentless on-the-ground organizing and a yearslong effort to register voters by activists who have played a crucial role in some of the left's biggest political victories in the state. Unlike the Trump campaign, the Biden team avoided in-person canvassing for most of the year out of fear of spreading the coronavirus. But halting door-to-door efforts put the Democratic nominee at a disadvantage, and grassroots groups and activists have been filling in the void. While the pandemic has made in-person outreach harder, it has also been a motivating force, as Arizona's Latino communities are among the hardest hit by Covid-19.\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva, a progressive Democrat who has represented southern Arizona in Congress since 2003, believes that Democrats are poised to sweep the elections in his home state. \"Fourteen years ago, a decade ago, nobody would have imagined that,\" he told The Intercept in a phone interview, after spending most of the day campaigning with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Tucson.\n\n\"[SB 1070] was a watershed moment for the state of Arizona, in the sense that it was so raw and so politically motivated in terms of making the immigrant community and Latinos, by obvious association, the target that it backfired,\" Grijalva said. \"And it backfired in the sense that it politicized a lot of people and energized a generation of activists.\"\n\nGrijalva, who contracted Covid-19 in early August, added that the \"abject failure\" and \"incompetence\" of the Trump administration's pandemic response, along with the disproportionate infection rates among Latinos in the state, have been the major factors driving voters away from Trump.\n\nLeft/Top: Immigrant inmates show off a pair of pink underwear while sitting on a bunk in the Maricopa County Tent City jail in Phoenix, on March 11, 2013. Right/Bottom: Protesters chant during a protest against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio during his visit in Rancho Bernardo, Calif., on Aug. 10, 2010. Photo: John Moore/Getty Images; Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n\nThe movement didn't come together immediately. After the passage of SB 1070, a law Grijalva considered \"harsh\" and \"discriminatory,\" he suggested a limited boycott of the state to pressure lawmakers to reconsider the policy, comparing it to the boycott of Arizona in the 1990s when the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. As a result, the congressman received a wave of death threats, and the windows on his Yuma district office were shot out . He ended his call for a boycott when a federal judge halted key parts of SB 1070, but his reaction to the law made his 2010 reelection race, which should have been in the bag, the toughest of his entire career.\n\n\"Well, it became a thing that the whole political establishment, including many Democrats, unified around the idea that I was calling for economic sanctions against the state,\" he said. \"And over a million bucks - in those days that was a lot of money - from independent expenditure campaigns were against me.\"\n\nHe defeated his Republican challenger by less than 10,000 votes.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down portions of SB 1070 in 2012, but it didn't lose most of its power until 2016, as part of a settlement with the National Immigration Law Center and other immigrants' rights groups that sued after its passage.\n\nLUCHA (which means \"struggle\" or \"fight\" in Spanish) was formed in 2009 in response to SB 1070, but grew its political clout through the Arpaio fight. In 2016, the leaders of LUCHA, Puente, and Poder in Action, created the Bazta Arpaio campaign, joining forces with labor movement leaders, like AFL-CIO organizer Neidi Dominguez and AFGE organizer Joe Diggs. Bazta Arpaio, organizers said, led the largest get-out-the-vote canvassing effort in Arizona history, specifically mobilizing first-time Latino voters.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, the same day Donald Trump was elected, thousands of activists and volunteers celebrated the defeat of Arpaio in what local organizers described as a \"bittersweet moment.\"\n\nFormer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio poses for a photograph in front of his campaign vehicle as he runs for the position of Maricopa County sheriff again in Fountain Hills, Ariz., on July 22, 2020.\n\nArpaio, whom Trump pardoned in 2017, tried to get his old job back earlier this year but lost the Republican primary to his former Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan by about 6,000 votes, marking his third electoral defeat in four years. He also had an unsuccessful run for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018.\n\nLUCHA has knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in neighborhoods in South Phoenix, South Tucson, and West Phoenix since then. One Arizona, which is made up of 23 organizations, collectively registered 190,000 voters in 2018 and took on a similar goal this year. Many of these groups have been increasing their outreach efforts each year, creating a voter mobilization machine. With more than 1.63 million ballots cast two days before the election, voter turnout in Maricopa County has already surpassed 2016 levels, according to election officials.\n\nGroups like Mijente, Chispa AZ, and Mi Familia Vota, which were part of the coalition One Arizona, have also been crucial in building to the current moment. Mijente was also a product of the SB 1070 fight and Arpaio era.\n\n\"The kids of the parents who Joe Arpaio and Russell Pearce terrorized through SB 1070 are the same kids that are voting for the first time,\" Gallardo said. \"And you better know that they remember what their parents went through. They're voting out Trump, they're going door-to-door getting other people out to vote, and you see just a tremendous force of young people that you've seen throughout this decade really leading the fight here in Arizona.\"\n\nSome of the Latino activists who were actively involved in the fight against these anti-immigrant policies -  like Phoenix City Council member Carlos Garcia and Democratic state Rep. Raquel Terán - sensed their power and decided to run for elected office. Garcia, a Mexican American immigrant and founder of the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona, protested Arpaio and has been arrested several times protesting deportations - a background not typically seen in Arizona's local elected officials. Terán, who was active in the successful recall effort against Pearce, won a seat in the state legislature in 2018.\n\nLeft/Top: A protester shouts at a riot police officer before being arrested at a demonstration against Arizona's immigration enforcement law SB 1070 on July 29, 2010 in Phoenix.

Alicia Contreras, executive director of CORAZÓN Arizona, a faith-based community group, said that the state's political shift is a result of \"our blood, sweat, and tears, out there on the field, registering voters and educating folks.\"\n\nIn 2020 alone, LUCHA has made nearly 3 million calls to get out the vote. LUCHA's sister organization, the Arizona Center for Empowerment, has been focusing on a civic engagement campaign that recently registered 47,000 new voters. UNITE HERE, the union representing hospitality workers, has been knocking on doors in the desert heat, which the Biden campaign and party avoided doing for most of the season. Biden's team is aiming to win at least 70 percent of Latino voters in the state.\n\nWith 11 electoral votes and a U.S. Senate seat on the line, Arizona has become one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. It's a must-win for Trump, who captured the state by a margin of 3.5 percentage points in 2016. No Republican has ever won the presidency without Arizona. It's possible, but it hasn't been done and the path would be very narrow. The most recent polling averages suggest that Biden is ahead by about 2.8 points. Though Biden has not traveled to the state as much as Trump has, the state has attracted tens of millions of dollars from both sides, making Phoenix one of the biggest advertising markets in the presidential race.\n\nCORAZÓN Arizona has been holding socially distanced canvassing sessions, phone-banking events, and text banking leading up to the election. \"Yes, there's a candidate that is more aligned and willing to support our values,\" she said. \"But we understand that we still have to do work. It does not stop on November 3.\"\n\nIris Acosta, right, a laid-off hospitality worker and member of UNITE HERE Local 11, talks to Phoenix resident Christopher Lowe, as Acosta canvasses the suburbs of Phoenix, on Oct. 15, 2020.\n\nThe race between moderate Democrat Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, and Republican Sen. Martha McSally, could potentially decide the balance of power in the Senate. In recent weeks, Kelly has opened an even bigger lead over McSally and dramatically outraised the incumbent, raising more than $83 million, compared with her $50 million. McSally was appointed to the seat previously held by the late Sen. John McCain in 2018, after losing a race for the other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Democrats also have good chances of taking the state House and breaking up the Republican trifecta. They only need to win two House seats. While it's much less likely that Democrats flip both the state House and Senate, their chances of recapturing the legislature are better than they have ever been.\n\nIn Arizona, Latinos make up about a quarter of the state's electorate, and increased turnout among the demographic contributed to Sinema's 2.3 margin of victory in 2018. More than 103,000 Latinos in Arizona reached voting age between 2018 and 2020 alone, according to a Mi Familia Vota report . Nationally, Latino voters are projected to be the largest nonwhite voting bloc for the first time in history.\n\nThough Biden has consistently held a significant lead over Trump among Latino voters, Trump's reelection campaign has been aggressively courting Latino male voters in states like Arizona and Florida, and appears to be siphoning a bit of Biden's support. A recent poll from the New York Times found that the former vice president leads among Latina voters by 34 percentage points, but only 8 points among men.\n\n\"I've been thinking a lot about that lately,\" Grijalva said about the gender gap. \"Just like with white males, and particularly with second- and third-generation Chicanos,\" he believes, these voters have drifted toward Trump because \"that's the only way they can express their sense of losing dominance, and it's unfortunate.\"\n\nBiden's struggle to appeal to Latino voters stretch back to the Democratic primary, when he lost young Latino voters overwhelmingly to Sen. Bernie Sanders across several Western states. He's caught up since then, but still lags behind Hillary Clinton's 2016 level of support in some states. Even after clinching the nomination, the Biden campaign was slow to prioritize Latino voter outreach.\n\nCorrection: November 2, 2020, 8:14 p.m. ET A photo caption referred to Iris Acosta as a Democratic Party activist.

      "text": "Latinx Voters Will Be a Core 2020 Voting Bloc. Are Democrats Paying Enough Attention?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLatinos are projected to account for more than 13 percent of eligible voters in 2020 - slightly more than the share of black voters.\n\nDemocrats running for president are awakening to the reality that Latinx voters, poised to become the largest nonwhite eligible voting bloc in 2020, are crucial to their chances of winning the presidency. The desire to connect with Latinx voters was apparent in this week's presidential debates, when several contenders made a direct appeal to the growing electorate by answering questions in Spanish on the national stage. The Democrats' recognition of the importance of Latinx voters extends beyond the meme-like performances in Miami, though - in a number of campaigns, outreach to this community of 29 million people has become a core part of strategy.\n\nAmong the front-runners, the campaigns of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been building outreach operations to engage with Latinx voters in early primary states, while former Vice President Joe Biden has been criticized for not doing enough to engage the community.\n\nThe Intercept reached out to the campaigns of the leading Democratic candidates; some of them, citing debate prep, said they were unavailable to discuss outreach to Latinx voters, while others did not respond to requests for comment. Just four candidates responded to our questions; Biden, Sanders, and Warren's campaigns said they have brought Latinx organizers onto their staff and are focusing efforts on Nevada, while former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's campaign said he is committed to ensuring his campaign staff reflect the diversity in experiences and backgrounds of all Americans.\n\n\"We know that we're going to communicate with young Latinos in English, we know we're going to communicate with young Latinos in Spanish,\" said Chuck Rocha, a senior Sanders adviser. \"We also understand the cultural differences between Latinos in Des Moines, Iowa, and Latinos in the East Side of Las Vegas.\"\n\nSens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have both done interviews with Univision's \"Despierta América.\" Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro , the only Hispanic candidate running for president, has also interviewed with Spanish-language outlets.\n\nTheir efforts are not just about winning Latinx voters over in the primary; high turnout, particularly among people who are eligible but don't typically vote, could be a deciding factor in the general election. Latinos are projected to account for more than 13 percent of eligible voters in 2020 - slightly more than the share of black voters, according to Pew Research Center . And thanks to an adjusted primary schedule that prioritizes states like California and Texas, two delegate-rich states with the largest Latinx populations in the country, the Latinx community will play a greater role in deciding the Democratic nominee than ever before. Nevada, where roughly 28 percent of its population is Hispanic, will be the first state in the West to hold its caucus, followed by California and Texas on Super Tuesday.\n\nSanders and Biden have been leading every other candidate in support from Hispanic voters in national polls. According to a recent Univision Noticias poll conducted by Latino Decisions and North Star Opinion Research, 21 percent of the Latinos surveyed currently plan to vote for Biden while 20 percent currently plan to vote for Sanders. Both are front-runners among overall voters as well, with Biden in particular benefiting from high name recognition.\n\nSanders and Castro had the highest favorable-to-unfavorabl e ratio among Latino Democrats surveyed - a nearly 5-to-1 favorable ratio. The fact that the electorate skews younger than other racial and ethnic groups also bodes well for Sanders, who tends to poll favorably with young voters. In the 2018 midterms , about 43.5 percent of all Hispanic eligible voters were 18 to 35 years old, compared with 30.6 percent of all eligible voters. Young Latinx voters also helped drive record turnout rates in the midterms, as 27 percent of Hispanics who cast a ballot said it was their first time voting in a midterm election.\n\nThe candidates' embrace of Spanish-language television networks and casual, albeit mediocre, use of Spanish - in campaign ads as well as at the presidential debate - signals the Latinx vote is on their minds. Using the language alone won't get Latino voters to turn out on election day, but it's a useful way of connecting with the estimated 41 million U.S. residents who speak the language.\n\nOn Wednesday night, O'Rourke spontaneously broke into Spanish just minutes into the first presidential debate to avoid answering a question about marginal tax rates. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who appeared to be taken aback by O'Rourke's Spanish skills, triggering a flurry of memes in the process, answered a question about immigration in Spanish. Castro began his closing statement in Spanish and ended with an \"adios to Donald Trump.\"\n\nOn the second night of primary debates, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg bantered with the moderator in Spanish before answering a question about the student debt crisis. Other candidates, like Harris, have tested their Spanish in different venues. In a recent interview with Univision, Harris tried a tongue twister in Spanish: \"tres tristes tigres,\" or three sad tigers. When asked if she knows any words in Spanish, she said \"pendejo,\" which loosely means \"stupid.\" (That was the second time a candidate used the word \"pendejo\" on the campaign trail.)\n\nKamala Harris talked about what inspires her, she tried tongue twisters in Spanish and told us what special name has for the President in DM's with Univision News #UNews pic.twitter.com/xbXssIn8Da\n\n- Univision News (@UnivisionNews) June 27, 2019\n\nWhile some voters were genuinely moved by the gesture , other voters waved it off as pandering . Indeed, not all Latinx Americans speak Spanish, and the ones who do are more than the language they speak. And Democratic candidates often fall into the trap of treating the diverse demographic group as a monolith, particularly when using immigration as a proxy for Latinx policy issues. Health care and economic justice, not immigration, typically poll as the top issues for the electorate.\n\nTop-tier candidates like Sanders and Warren have been building out their outreach operations in Nevada and states across the country. \"Starting with staff, we're building a campaign that is as diverse and inclusive as the values we are fighting for everyday,\" a Warren campaign aide told The Intercept.\n\nIn Nevada, they have nearly 40 full-time staffers and several interns on the ground, along with Spanish-speaking staffers at all levels. Their East Las Vegas field team has also been meeting with local Latinx activists and are looking to host caucus trainings.\n\nRocha, the Sanders adviser, told The Intercept that including Latinos at every level of the campaign is going to help them mobilize the community. \"W e will spend every resource we need to assure we continue to win the Latino vote as we're currently doing in every poll,\" he said.\n\n\"Working with Bernie Sanders every single day and being in a position of decision-making, we run this campaign with a cultural competency that won't be seen by any other campaign this cycle,\" Rocha added.\n\nSanders has \"literally surrounded himself\" with some of the best activists of color in the nation and actually listens to them, Rocha said. \"That's how we're gonna win that vote.\"\n\nAccording to the campaign, 10 percent of his staffers at the national headquarters are Latinx, including several undocumented immigrants. Belén Sisa, an undocumented immigrant under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, serves as the campaign's national deputy press secretary, and Analilia Mejia is the campaign's political director.\n\nTexas is also a prime target for Latinx outreach, and O'Rourke's campaign said his grounding in the state will enable him to make inroads with the community there. \"Growing and raising his kids in part of the largest binational community in the Western Hemisphere, Beto understands the issues facing Latinx people are not just felt in El Paso but in communities across the country,\" a campaign spokesperson said. \"As Beto continues to travel and meet with people from all walks of life, he is committed to ensuring his policy proposals - like his comprehensive immigration plan and his plan to help small businesses run by women and people of color - and campaign staff are reflective of the diversity in experiences, backgrounds, and voices of all Americans.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBiden, meanwhile, has barely even mentioned the Latino community on the campaign trail, and his recent absence at a presidential forum hosted by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials fueled criticism of his outreach efforts. Eight presidential candidates attended the forum last week in Miami, Florida, to address the largest gathering of Latinx policymakers in the country. Harris and Booker didn't attend either.\n\nLeo Murrieta, director of Make the Road Nevada, told Politico it's \"disheartening\" Biden's campaign has not engaged more directly with grassroots organizations or spent more time on the ground while the Nevada caucuses are just eight months away.\n\n\"Vice President Biden committed from day one that Latinos will have a voice at the highest level of this campaign,\" campaign spokesman Isabel Aldunate told The Intercept, a day before Biden skipped out on NALEO's forum. \"The Biden campaign has hit the ground running with Latino outreach including a fully translated website, top Latino political operatives in campaign leadership, and carefully cultivated policies designed to address problems that specifically affect communities of color.\"\n\nIn addition to hiring more than a dozen people of color in senior positions like Cristóbal Alex, the former president of the political organization Latino Victory, the campaign also has several full-time staffers in Nevada. Biden's campaign, which has generally been avoiding the press, did not respond to follow up questions about the criticism from Latinx leaders.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "If Arizona Goes Blue, Look to Joe Arpaio - and the Latinos Who Organized Against Him\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nYou can't understand how the state moved left without going back to the Maricopa County sheriff's racist policies.\n\nAbril Gallardo first became involved with grassroots organizing as a young undocumented student living in Arizona in 2010. She joined Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, shortly after the state legislature passed the draconian \"show me your papers\" immigration law and started holding her own know your rights meetings around her community and knocking on doors to get rid of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\nSenate Bill 1070, as its officially known, was the most punitive immigration law in the nation and gave rise to copycat legislation in other states. The bill, which was signed into law by former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, encouraged racial profiling by allowing police officers to question anyone deemed suspicious about their immigration status during any interaction, including routine traffic stops. State Senate President Russell Pearce, a powerful far-right lawmaker and architect of SB 1070, made his hostility toward immigrants his signature legislative issue - paving the way for Arpaio to use his department to make life so miserable for immigrants that they would rather flee the state.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nUnder his 24-year reign, which spanned from 1993 to 2016, Arpaio and his officers systematically targeted Latinos and people of color, used brutal policing policies, and were accused of far too many forms of misconduct to list. \"We had our own Trumpistas, or little Trumps, before Trump,\" Gallardo said.\n\n\"We experienced raids in our neighborhoods before raids were streamlined throughout the nation,\" she continued. \"Our people, Black and brown bodies, were being killed by police departments. That has been happening for many, many years. We saw our car washes getting raided, and workers, literally moms and dads, not being able to pick up their kids because they were arrested by Arpaio. We were able to experience all of that way before Trump was elected.\"\n\nGallardo is now a communications director of LUCHA, but back then she just wanted to learn her rights and know how to protect her family, in case they were ever pulled over on their way to church or the grocery store. \"It was a very scary time,\" she said. Whenever they missed a call on the home phone, she recalled, \"My first thought would be, 'Oh my God, my dad got pulled over.'\"\n\nGallardo was far from the only one who decided to stay in the state and transform the fear into energy. Arpaio, who became nationally known for workplace raids and neighborhood sweeps aimed at rounding up undocumented immigrants, seemed invincible. Pearce did too. But their yearslong crusade against immigrants had an unintended consequence: It ended up galvanizing an entire generation of Latinos and young progressives, who helped build a grassroots movement that would eventually push them out of office and transform the state's politics.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIf Arizona turns blue on Tuesday, it will be the result of relentless on-the-ground organizing and a yearslong effort to register voters by activists who have played a crucial role in some of the left's biggest political victories in the state. Unlike the Trump campaign, the Biden team avoided in-person canvassing for most of the year out of fear of spreading the coronavirus. But halting door-to-door efforts put the Democratic nominee at a disadvantage, and grassroots groups and activists have been filling in the void. While the pandemic has made in-person outreach harder, it has also been a motivating force, as Arizona's Latino communities are among the hardest hit by Covid-19.\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva, a progressive Democrat who has represented southern Arizona in Congress since 2003, believes that Democrats are poised to sweep the elections in his home state. \"Fourteen years ago, a decade ago, nobody would have imagined that,\" he told The Intercept in a phone interview, after spending most of the day campaigning with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Tucson.\n\n\"[SB 1070] was a watershed moment for the state of Arizona, in the sense that it was so raw and so politically motivated in terms of making the immigrant community and Latinos, by obvious association, the target that it backfired,\" Grijalva said. \"And it backfired in the sense that it politicized a lot of people and energized a generation of activists.\"\n\nGrijalva, who contracted Covid-19 in early August, added that the \"abject failure\" and \"incompetence\" of the Trump administration's pandemic response, along with the disproportionate infection rates among Latinos in the state, have been the major factors driving voters away from Trump.\n\nLeft/Top: Immigrant inmates show off a pair of pink underwear while sitting on a bunk in the Maricopa County Tent City jail in Phoenix, on March 11, 2013. Right/Bottom: Protesters chant during a protest against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio during his visit in Rancho Bernardo, Calif., on Aug. 10, 2010. Photo: John Moore/Getty Images; Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n\nThe movement didn't come together immediately. After the passage of SB 1070, a law Grijalva considered \"harsh\" and \"discriminatory,\" he suggested a limited boycott of the state to pressure lawmakers to reconsider the policy, comparing it to the boycott of Arizona in the 1990s when the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. As a result, the congressman received a wave of death threats, and the windows on his Yuma district office were shot out . He ended his call for a boycott when a federal judge halted key parts of SB 1070, but his reaction to the law made his 2010 reelection race, which should have been in the bag, the toughest of his entire career.\n\n\"Well, it became a thing that the whole political establishment, including many Democrats, unified around the idea that I was calling for economic sanctions against the state,\" he said. \"And over a million bucks - in those days that was a lot of money - from independent expenditure campaigns were against me.\"\n\nHe defeated his Republican challenger by less than 10,000 votes.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down portions of SB 1070 in 2012, but it didn't lose most of its power until 2016, as part of a settlement with the National Immigration Law Center and other immigrants' rights groups that sued after its passage.\n\nLUCHA (which means \"struggle\" or \"fight\" in Spanish) was formed in 2009 in response to SB 1070, but grew its political clout through the Arpaio fight. In 2016, the leaders of LUCHA, Puente, and Poder in Action, created the Bazta Arpaio campaign, joining forces with labor movement leaders, like AFL-CIO organizer Neidi Dominguez and AFGE organizer Joe Diggs. Bazta Arpaio, organizers said, led the largest get-out-the-vote canvassing effort in Arizona history, specifically mobilizing first-time Latino voters.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, the same day Donald Trump was elected, thousands of activists and volunteers celebrated the defeat of Arpaio in what local organizers described as a \"bittersweet moment.\"\n\nFormer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio poses for a photograph in front of his campaign vehicle as he runs for the position of Maricopa County sheriff again in Fountain Hills, Ariz., on July 22, 2020.\n\nArpaio, whom Trump pardoned in 2017, tried to get his old job back earlier this year but lost the Republican primary to his former Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan by about 6,000 votes, marking his third electoral defeat in four years. He also had an unsuccessful run for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018.\n\nLUCHA has knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in neighborhoods in South Phoenix, South Tucson, and West Phoenix since then. One Arizona, which is made up of 23 organizations, collectively registered 190,000 voters in 2018 and took on a similar goal this year. Many of these groups have been increasing their outreach efforts each year, creating a voter mobilization machine. With more than 1.63 million ballots cast two days before the election, voter turnout in Maricopa County has already surpassed 2016 levels, according to election officials.\n\nGroups like Mijente, Chispa AZ, and Mi Familia Vota, which were part of the coalition One Arizona, have also been crucial in building to the current moment. Mijente was also a product of the SB 1070 fight and Arpaio era.\n\n\"The kids of the parents who Joe Arpaio and Russell Pearce terrorized through SB 1070 are the same kids that are voting for the first time,\" Gallardo said. \"And you better know that they remember what their parents went through. They're voting out Trump, they're going door-to-door getting other people out to vote, and you see just a tremendous force of young people that you've seen throughout this decade really leading the fight here in Arizona.\"\n\nSome of the Latino activists who were actively involved in the fight against these anti-immigrant policies -  like Phoenix City Council member Carlos Garcia and Democratic state Rep. Raquel Terán - sensed their power and decided to run for elected office. Garcia, a Mexican American immigrant and founder of the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona, protested Arpaio and has been arrested several times protesting deportations - a background not typically seen in Arizona's local elected officials. Terán, who was active in the successful recall effort against Pearce, won a seat in the state legislature in 2018.\n\nLeft/Top: A protester shouts at a riot police officer before being arrested at a demonstration against Arizona's immigration enforcement law SB 1070 on July 29, 2010 in Phoenix.

Photo: John Moore/Getty Images; Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images\n\nThe wave of Latino activism that emerged in response to Arpaio and the state's racist policies, combined with long-lasting demographic changes, has accelerated Arizona's political transformation from a Republican bastion to an increasingly purple state. Alicia Contreras, executive director of CORAZÓN Arizona, a faith-based community group, said that the state's political shift is a result of \"our blood, sweat, and tears, out there on the field, registering voters and educating folks.\"\n\nIn 2020 alone, LUCHA has made nearly 3 million calls to get out the vote. LUCHA's sister organization, the Arizona Center for Empowerment, has been focusing on a civic engagement campaign that recently registered 47,000 new voters. UNITE HERE, the union representing hospitality workers, has been knocking on doors in the desert heat, which the Biden campaign and party avoided doing for most of the season. Biden's team is aiming to win at least 70 percent of Latino voters in the state.\n\nWith 11 electoral votes and a U.S. Senate seat on the line, Arizona has become one of the most hotly contested battleground states in the country. It's a must-win for Trump, who captured the state by a margin of 3.5 percentage points in 2016. No Republican has ever won the presidency without Arizona. It's possible, but it hasn't been done and the path would be very narrow. The most recent polling averages suggest that Biden is ahead by about 2.8 points. Though Biden has not traveled to the state as much as Trump has, the state has attracted tens of millions of dollars from both sides, making Phoenix one of the biggest advertising markets in the presidential race.\n\nCORAZÓN Arizona has been holding socially distanced canvassing sessions, phone-banking events, and text banking leading up to the election. \"Yes, there's a candidate that is more aligned and willing to support our values,\" she said. \"But we understand that we still have to do work. It does not stop on November 3.\"\n\nIris Acosta, right, a laid-off hospitality worker and member of UNITE HERE Local 11, talks to Phoenix resident Christopher Lowe, as Acosta canvasses the suburbs of Phoenix, on Oct. 15, 2020.\n\nThe race between moderate Democrat Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, and Republican Sen. Martha McSally, could potentially decide the balance of power in the Senate. In recent weeks, Kelly has opened an even bigger lead over McSally and dramatically outraised the incumbent, raising more than $83 million, compared with her $50 million. McSally was appointed to the seat previously held by the late Sen. John McCain in 2018, after losing a race for the other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Democrats also have good chances of taking the state House and breaking up the Republican trifecta. They only need to win two House seats. While it's much less likely that Democrats flip both the state House and Senate, their chances of recapturing the legislature are better than they have ever been.\n\nIn Arizona, Latinos make up about a quarter of the state's electorate, and increased turnout among the demographic contributed to Sinema's 2.3 margin of victory in 2018. More than 103,000 Latinos in Arizona reached voting age between 2018 and 2020 alone, according to a Mi Familia Vota report . Nationally, Latino voters are projected to be the largest nonwhite voting bloc for the first time in history.\n\nThough Biden has consistently held a significant lead over Trump among Latino voters, Trump's reelection campaign has been aggressively courting Latino male voters in states like Arizona and Florida, and appears to be siphoning a bit of Biden's support. A recent poll from the New York Times found that the former vice president leads among Latina voters by 34 percentage points, but only 8 points among men.\n\n\"I've been thinking a lot about that lately,\" Grijalva said about the gender gap. \"Just like with white males, and particularly with second- and third-generation Chicanos,\" he believes, these voters have drifted toward Trump because \"that's the only way they can express their sense of losing dominance, and it's unfortunate.\"\n\nBiden's struggle to appeal to Latino voters stretch back to the Democratic primary, when he lost young Latino voters overwhelmingly to Sen. Bernie Sanders across several Western states. He's caught up since then, but still lags behind Hillary Clinton's 2016 level of support in some states. Even after clinching the nomination, the Biden campaign was slow to prioritize Latino voter outreach.\n\nCorrection: November 2, 2020, 8:14 p.m. ET A photo caption referred to Iris Acosta as a Democratic Party activist. She is a laid-off hospitality worker and member of UNITE HERE Local 11.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Democrats Are Panicked That Latinos Won't Turn Out to Vote - but Not Enough to Talk to Them About It\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA recent poll found that more than half of Latinos nationwide haven't been contacted by a political party or campaign about voting or registering to vote.\n\nOn June 28 , Democratic Party Chair Tom Perez joined a protest in Brownsville, Texas, the site of a former Walmart turned into the largest child immigrant detention center in the country. \"This is unconscionable,\" Perez said of the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents, in a video produced by the Democratic Party. \"I wanted to make sure we were down here because Democrats believe that families should be united with their children.\"\n\nLater that day, Perez hopped on a private plane to Los Angeles for a lavish Democratic National Committee fundraiser, where a $100,000 ticket came with dinner and a photo opportunity with former President Barack Obama. Perez's travel mate - and the owner of the private jet - was DNC donor Albert Dwoskin, a landlord who's currently engaged in high-profile litigation over accusations that he violated federal civil rights laws by evicting Latino immigrant families from their homes. (The DNC did not respond to requests for comment on Perez's flight.)\n\nWhile the details of Perez's flight haven't previously been reported, the anecdote in general is unlikely to surprise many potential Latino voters, whose experience with governments in Latin America, either directly or passed down through parents, has engendered a well-earned skepticism about politicians. Now with midterm elections less than two weeks away, Democratic operatives are kept awake at night , as one strategist put it, by the question of Latino voter turnout, which is critical to the party's chances of retaking the House or the Senate. That existential fear, however, has not been matched by an equally robust effort to reach voters.\n\nMore than half of Latinos nationwide haven't been contacted by a political party or campaign about voting or registering to vote, according to an NALEO Education Fund/Latino Decisions poll . Sixty-four percent reported not being sure what the Democratic Party stands for.\n\nMatt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions, said the polling firm has never seen higher levels of anger in the Latino community but that Democrats can't expect anger alone to mobilize voters. \"They're telling us they're angry, they're disgusted, they're frustrated,\" he said, but those emotions won't translate to votes \"if voters don't know who individual candidates are and what they stand for - because Trump isn't on the ballot, and they need to know where to direct their anger.\"\n\nIndeed, a recent national NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday found a surge of enthusiasm among registered Latino voters. Seventy-one percent expressed high interest in the midterms, up from the 49 percent that said so in September.\n\nLatino voter turnout, however, has historically been low, and Democrats have not done much over the years to court the diverse political force of at least 29 million eligible voters. This year, conventional wisdom says that the rage that exists within Latino communities over the Trump administration's virulently anti-immigrant policies and racist rhetoric will be enough - but if that does not translate to votes, Democrats will only have themselves to blame.\n\nCampaign outreach is one of the strongest predictors of turnout, and political candidates and campaigns have largely ignored Latino voters for decades. This year - even as a number of hotly contested seats happen to be in states with sizable Latino populations like Nevada, Florida, and Arizona - is no exception.\n\nIn interviews with The Intercept, Latinos who don't intend to vote on November 6 gave two common explanations for their reasons: \"I'm not informed enough to vote\" and \"I don't know who the candidates are.\" All but one said they had not been asked to vote by any political organization or campaign, nor had they received any mailers.\n\nThe Democratic Party has been defensive in response to criticisms over its lack of attention to Latino voters. On Twitter, Meredith Kelly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's communications director slammed a New York Times reporter for his reporting on the subject.\n\n. @jdelreal : Do you know what the @dccc is doing to talk to Latinos?\n\nNeither me, @JJavierGamboa nor @tyzlaw have spoken to you in MONTHS.\n\nFYI: We've had a 2 year, unprecedented $30M Dem base turnout program w/ big focus on Latinos.\n\nThis is really bad reporting.\n\nCC: @mikiebarb https://t.co/zMcshMrfVQ\n\n- Meredith Kelly (@meredithk27) October 26, 2018\n\nThe DCCC has been doing on-the-ground outreach in Latino communities since February 2017, a DCCC aide told The Intercept, and has invested heavily in media messaging, including Spanish-language ads. In at least 29 congressional districts, the DCCC has at least one Latino field staffer, and the organization has also designated Latino constituency organizers in districts with large Hispanic populations, the aide added.\n\nThe DNC, for its part, pointed to to nearly $3 million spent on voter registration, organizing, and Spanish-language ad buys ahead of the midterms. A DNC official, who requested anonymity to discuss the party's finances, said there's been a big investment in Latino outreach infrastructure since Perez took over last year. But, the official said, the DNC doesn't \"necessarily have the resources that the RNC has had this year\" to do as much as it would like.\n\nLatinos vote at a polling station in El Gallo Restaurant on Nov. 8, 2016, in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nThe number of eligible Hispanic voters has significantly grown in recent years, primarily due to U.S.-born Hispanics turning 18. But the rate of voter turnout has been on the decline. In 2014, the Hispanic turnout rate for midterm elections reached an all-time low, the Pew Research Center found , even though a record number of Latinos voted. Age is one factor. The Hispanic population is younger than any other major ethnic or racial group, and age is one of the strongest predictors of whether someone is likely to vote. Young people are significantly less likely to vote in midterm elections, compared to older generations. About 43.5 percent of all Hispanic eligible voters in 2018 are 18 to 35 years old, compared with 30.6 percent of all eligible voters, according to Pew.\n\nBut demographics alone don't explain voter apathy. It feels suspiciously simple, but like other communities that are considered disengaged, Latinos don't vote because no one is asking them to. Beyond feelings of distrust of the political system, which aren't exclusive to this group of voters, the pattern of low Hispanic turnout can be blamed in part on the Democratic Party's decadeslong failure to adequately invest in Latino outreach and infrastructure.\n\nThis is a problem identified by David Garcia, the Democratic nominee for Arizona governor. His campaign made deliberate efforts to reach long-ignored voters in the state - Latino or otherwise - and those efforts were likely a factor in record-high voter turnout in the August primary. \"The Democratic playbook in Arizona has historically been, go to the middle to try to embrace moderates and then in the end - I have literally heard it said this way - going out to young people and people of color to get you over the top,\" Garcia told The Intercept this summer . \"That is what the Democrats have tried to do in Arizona forever ... and we are flipping that.\"\n\nGrassroots groups have ramped up their efforts to register Latinos ahead of the midterms. The nonprofit Voto Latino, for example, aims to register 1 million new voters by 2020 through their first bilingual campaign. But activists alone cannot counteract those campaigns with anemic investment in Latino outreach.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle. Campaigns would rather spend their resources on groups they have more confidence will show up at the polls, instead of going against a consultant's advice and investing in Latino outreach infrastructure, said Barreto, of Latino Decisions. Consequently, campaigns presuming disinterest won't do the work of knocking on doors, making phone calls, and engaging with Hispanic communities and their specific policy priorities: the economy, education, health care, and immigration.\n\nInstead they rely on identical messaging or last-minute Spanish-language ads. Hispanic voters lean Democratic, but are, more often than not, treated as a monolith. Even though - like any other voting bloc - their political beliefs are influenced by factors like age, region, and education.\n\nCalifornia's 25th District , which includes parts of northern Los Angeles and Ventura counties, is now about 40 percent Hispanic. Mario Castro, a second-generation Salvadoran-American industrial welder, said he's not voting there because he doesn't \"feel like this current administration is here to help anyone but themselves.\"\n\n\"I'm not really informed that well on each party and each of the candidates,\" said Diana Nava, a 23-year-old medical assistant in the 25th District, where Republican incumbent Rep. Steve Knight is in a tight race against first-time candidate Katie Hill. \"And it's kind of disappointing because they do say one thing, and they end up doing another thing, so it's hard to trust some leaders.\"\n\nWhen asked why he isn't planning on voting given his position against the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress, Castro said it's because he doesn't feel strongly about any of the candidates. The one candidate he had \"looked forward\" to was Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 presidential election, but even then, \"I didn't vote when I probably should've.\"\n\nBalbina Ornelas, 45, became a U.S. citizen less than a year ago and has no intention to vote. Ornelas, who lives in Sylmar, California, said it's because she's politically uninformed and doesn't understand much English. \"I don't know anything [about politics]. I received the papers to vote, but I don't know how to do it,\" she said in Spanish. (Her congressional district, California's 29th, leans solidly Democratic.)\n\nIn addition to voter suppression laws in dozens of states that disproportionately impact communities of color , the Hispanic population's electoral impact is diluted by geography, causing some to feel like their vote doesn't count. Most Latinos are concentrated in non-battleground states. Just six states hold about 71 percent of eligible Hispanic voters, including 7.7 million who live in California and 5.4 million who live in Texas. At least one battleground state, Florida, has a sizable population of eligible Latino voters at 3 million.\n\nDemocratic candidate Beto O'Rourke is stalking Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, where Latinos make up roughly 40 percent of the population. Even with a candidate like O'Rourke - who raised a stunning $38 million of campaign cash in just three months, traveled to each of the state's 254 counties, and speaks fluent Spanish - his chances likely hinge on his campaign's ability to turn out Latino votes. Texas - where many Latino families have been living for centuries, long before it was a state - isn't so much a red state as it is a nonvoting state, as it consistently ranks as one of the states with the lowest voter participation rates. Latino voters there - at least the ones who vote - lean Democratic, but by a far smaller margin than elsewhere in the country.\n\n\"You will see in the Latino community, unfortunately, a high level of cynicism, but I think that's because both parties have failed to talk to them, to reach them, and to really speak to how their lives are going to be better,\" said Cristina Tzintzún, the founder and executive director of Jolt , a Texas-based nonprofit working to register and mobilize young Latinos across the state. \"I know that sounds incredibly simple, but they're really not doing it with the Latino community, for the most part. So a lot of Latinos just don't see how their lives are going to be different if they go out and vote.\"\n\nWhat O'Rourke has done right, Tzintzún said, is \"run a campaign that is unabashedly progressive, that is willing to be strong on the issues that matter to Latino voters.\" But the voters still need to be turned out - and that's about knocking on their doors, she added. \"We'll find out whether Beto's campaign did that early enough and whether they spent enough money to do that.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMost of the Hispanic population is not yet of age ; 32 percent are under 18, and nearly half of U.S.-born Latinos are under 18. But demographics are not destiny, Tzintzún said, \"unless you invest in registering and turning out voters, talking to them about how you're going to make their lives better.\"\n\n\"It's very simple steps that you would think parties and candidates would do, but you would be surprised that, I find, that most candidates running for office don't do that with Latino voters, and they leave everything on the table.\"\n\nAnother Texas candidate, Sri Preston Kulkarni , has taken the radical step of building his campaign around the idea of talking to voters - in his case, the diverse Asian-American population that comprises the state's 22nd Congressional District. He did it so effectively, setting up phone banks in 13 languages, that the party has taken note, adding him to the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" list.\n\nPolitical pundits assume that Latinos know they're the \"sleeping giant\" and are actively choosing not to participate, Tzintzún said, but that's not the case at all. She said most young Latinos she meets \"have no idea they make up 40 percent of the state's population.\"\n\nLuis Martinez, a student at the University of California, Irvine, hadn't realized the race in the 45th Congressional District where he lives is rated a toss-up . \"I feel like if I were to vote, I need to research the candidates and what they are trying to do, which right now I don't have time for,\" he wrote in a text message. \"If I were to be more up to date with the news, maybe I would, but like I said, politics aren't for me.\"\n\nUpdate: Oct. 26, 2018, 3:06 p.m. This piece has been updated to include comment from a DCCC aide that was received after publication.\n\nWAIT!

The key to winning working-class Latinos to a left politics is to offer a positive vision that materially improves their lives.\n\nSophia Hildalgo (L) and Amore Rodriguez of Miami stay with their car decorated in \"Cubans for Biden\n paint as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered remarks during a drive-in voter mobilization event at Miramar Regional Park on October 13.(Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nElection after election, the \"Latino vote\" continues to frustrate statistical forecasters and political prognosticators, who continually predict that an imminent Latino wave will cement a majority for the Democratic Party. This expectation, predicated on the idea that Latinos will naturally gravitate toward progressive politics, places blind faith in changing demographics, ignoring the hard work of political organizing and policy-driven outreach.\n\nDespite assumptions that the nativist and xenophobic forces now dominating the Republican Party would repel Latino voters, early evidence suggests that Donald Trump increased his share of Latino support nationwide. While this might seem surprising, historian Geraldo Cadava's new book, The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, From Nixon to Trump , offers an important account of how the Republican Party has cultivated support among Latinos since the 1970s. Moving beyond a limited view that typecasts Hispanic Republicans as simply Cuban exiles or conservative Catholics, Cadava traces a longer history of patronage politics and institution building that has, over time, yielded a loyal and influential base within the Republican Party.\n\nIn the following interview by Jaime Acosta Gonzalez, Cadava discusses the formation of Hispanic Republican identity, the challenges of defeating an anti-communist message, and how we might get beyond thinking about Latinos as a monolith.\n\nPeople of Latin American descent living in the United States have, over the last seventy years, self-identified in various ways: as hyphenated-Americans (Cuban-American, Mexican-American, etc.), Chicanos, Latinos, and, more recently, Latinx. The group of people you write about identify as \"Hispanic,\" and more specifically \"Hispanic Republicans.\" Can you explain the significance of this self-identification?\n\nThe ethnic labels applied to Latinos or the self-conceptions of Latinos have meant a lot of different things over time. I used the term \"Hispanic\" because it's the term preferred by the actors I wrote about, especially in the early years of the movement during the '60s and '70s. The first official auxiliary of the Republican National Committee took the name the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.\n\nI think it also means to them a connection with Spain and the Spanish Empire in the Americas. What's important about articulating a connection to Spain is how it simultaneously implies that you don't see yourself as of African or indigenous descent, and that does relate to an aspirational whiteness.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things that I learned while doing research is that Latino conservatives don't see the history of the Spanish Empire in the Americas in the same way that most of us who studied Latino history do. The version of Latino history I learned was that the Spanish Empire colonized and conquered the Americas, sowed a lot of violence, pressed indigenous groups into labor, and forced Christianity upon them. Many Latino conservatives see the presence of the Spanish in the Americas as a civilizing influence. They introduced large-scale cattle ranching and agriculture to the Southwest. They spread Christianity throughout the Americas. These are positive associations.\n\nOne of my favorite books I came across was Manuel Machado's Listen Chicano! (1978). You can kind of imagine this conservative Latino grabbing a Chicano by the lapel and shaking him saying, \"Listen here!\" It's this whole revision of Chicano history that I hadn't seen before. It reclaims the Spanish Empire as a proud tradition that all Latinos in the US should buy into. For many Hispanic conservatives, this is what the term \"Hispanic\" signifies.\n\nDo you think the \"Hispanic\" investment in civilizational grand narratives grafts quite easily onto the Republican Party?\n\nHispanic Republicans are always struggling for inclusion and acceptance within the Republican Party, and so it serves their purposes to be able to imagine themselves as people whose roots in the Americas extend back to the period even before white Europeans. Every Hispanic heritage month it comes up that Spanish was the first European language spoken in the US and that they were here for a hundred years before pilgrims settled Plymouth Rock. That is a point of pride for Hispanic Republicans.\n\nYou note that the 1964 election between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater marked the first time that a GOP candidate had done better among Hispanics than among African Americans, a trend that has remained constant ever since. In the aftermath of this election, how did the GOP leverage the gains of African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement to grow their share of the Hispanic vote in subsequent elections? In particular, how did Richard Nixon emerge as the candidate who broke through with Hispanics?\n\nThe mid-to-late 1960s is a critical moment in the turning away of African Americans from the Republican Party. Goldwater didn't support the Civil Rights Act, and the Republican Party embraced the \"Southern Strategy.\" As a result, African Americans left the party in great numbers. Therefore, Republican strategists were very explicit about their need to make up for that lost support, and Hispanics became their prime targets.\n\nWhat's interesting in your question is the idea that the Republican Party leveraged the civil rights gains of African Americans to recruit Latinos, because I think that's kind of what happened. The Republicans acknowledged that they needed to make up for those lost votes. The way they went about doing that was a divide-and-conquer strategy. The Republican Party, and Latinos who had begun to move toward the Republican Party, started saying things like \"Latinos have been loyal to the Democratic Party since the New Deal. FDR helped them put food on the table and get jobs in their time of need. How are we going to crack that?\"\n\nThe answer was, in part, asking, \"What has your loyalty to the Democratic Party gotten you?\" They also began to say that the Democratic Party cares only about African Americans, and that their civil rights strategy was only about giving them handouts. They would say, \"We know Latinos aren't like that,\" that Latinos were proud and didn't want to take government handouts, and that the Republican Party cares about you and will represent your interests.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, Latinos with conservative impulses - and I wouldn't call them Republicans yet, because they hadn't fully embraced that partisan identity - started saying that the African-American protesters were loud, take to the streets, and are disruptive, and that Latinos protested more respectfully, peacefully, and behind the scenes. That's part of the dynamic between African Americans and Latinos during the civil rights era that leads the Republican party to see opportunities with Latinos.\n\nWhat Nixon does specifically is start making high-level appointments, like the first Hispanic treasurer of the United States, Romana Acosta Bañuelos. Nixon created all of these economic agencies, like the National Economic Development Agency and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, and generally built this third plank of the Civil Rights Movement tied to notions of uplift, a \"brown capitalism\" centered around economic opportunity.\n\nThe argument of your book is that we only gain a partial view of Hispanic Republican identity by focusing on the Cuban-American experience. While it is true that Hispanics are motivated to vote for the Republican Party for a number of economic and ideological reasons, it is also true that anti-communism has remained a central feature of Hispanic Republican identity from the 1950s onward, and not just among Cuban exiles.\n\nHow have Hispanic Republicans mobilized a shared narrative about communism or socialism over time?\n\nI'm not sure how this will play with the Jacobin crowd, but in February I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled \"Will Latinos Buy Into 'Tío Bernie's' Socialism?,\" coincidentally four days before the 60 Minutes interview with Sanders where he was grilled about his earlier statements regarding Fidel.\n\nSanders supporters were upset because they thought I was saying there was no way he could win among Latinos because of the socialism issue. What I was saying was that just because Sanders had strong support in the Democratic primaries, it's not clear that support would translate to strong Latino support in a general election.\n\nThe other thing people said was that I was just talking about a small number of Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in South Florida. I think it's a mistake to put anti-communist Latinos into that box, because you miss how far and wide the anti-socialist message travels among all Latino groups.\n\nAll Latino national groups have their version of anti-communism. The Puerto Rican Republicans have always looked at the independistas , Puerto Ricans advocating for the independence of the island, as radical Marxists. There are these critical episodes in the early 1950s where activists bombed the governor's mansion in San Juan, Lolita Lebron opens fire on congress, they shoot through a window near the White House where Eisenhower was taking a nap. They are all labeled, in the context of the Cold War, as \"radical communists.\" So, Puerto Rican conservatives have their own version of anti-communism.\n\nSame thing with Mexican immigrants whose families came in the 1920s after the Mexican Revolution. They see the 1917 constitution as a Marxist-inspired document because of land redistribution and the way it stripped the Catholic church of its authority. Many Mexicans have their own version of anti-communism.\n\nI think it's a mistake to think that you can put Latino conservatives who have strongly anti-communist views into a box in South Florida, limiting it to Cubans and Venezuelans. As you note in your question, there is a much longer history dating back to the earliest days of the Cold War and continuing into the present.\n\nOne thing that's amazing to me is how the anti-communist message gets passed along from one group to another. In the 1980s, when the Sandinistas and Contras are fighting in Nicaragua, veterans of the Bay of Pigs are training Contras in Miami. Part of the reason Cuban-American politicians like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen become the champions of Nicaraguan refugees is because of the Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs trying to oust Castro. Cuban Americans said they fully understand the plight of Nicaraguan refugees because they experienced the same things two decades earlier. I think that idea gets passed down from one group to another across time.\n\nYou're seeing it play out now with how Hispanic Republicans think about the Democratic Socialists of America and people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I listened to Ted Cruz give a speech in 2018 at a gathering in DC of the Latino Coalition, an advocacy group for small business owners looking to grow their businesses and secure government or private loans. Cruz, in a single breath, mentioned Fidel Castro, Nicolas Maduro, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. It's a flat narrative about socialism that has managed to resonate for the last seventy years.\n\nI think there's this idea that now that Fidel is gone, a younger generation of Cuban Americans, whose experiences weren't defined by the Cold War, will be more progressive. That assumption underestimates how deep the narrative is. We saw how even younger Cubans supported Trump in the recent election.\n\nHow have Hispanic Republicans actively shaped US foreign policy in Latin America during and even after the Cold War? In your view, has the electoral pressure to appeal to Hispanic Republicans resulted in a more aggressive or interventionist approach?\n\nThat's interesting. I do think Hispanic Republicans have played a role in shaping US policy towards Latin America. Maybe they've even wanted to play a greater role than they have. In the fifties, one of the ways that Hispanic Republicans first started reaching out to the Eisenhower administration, for example, was by offering their services as Cold Warriors. They said that their language skills and understanding of the region's history and culture could help the United States accomplish its Cold War objectives.\n\nLater, Cubans like Jorge Mas Canosa helped shape Cuba policy, Mexican American businessmen and Hispanic Chambers of Commerce advised Republicans on trade issues, and support from Hispanic Republicans on Reagan's intervention in Nicaragua - or Trump's policies on Venezuela - certainly gave Republicans cover for inflicting violence in the hemisphere.\n\nHispanic Republicans constitute a minority within a minority. Historically, between 20 and 40 percent of Hispanics vote for the Republican candidate during a presidential election. With the appointment of Ana Navarro as head of Latino outreach, it seems like the Biden/Harris strategy was to try to persuade conservative Hispanics instead of growing the working-class Latino base that voted for Bernie Sanders during the primaries.  What do you make of this strategy?\n\nOne way to approach this is to say that Biden always found his greatest support, including during the primaries, among the less progressive-minded Latinos. What has proven true in the wake of the election is that in states like Arizona and Nevada, a lot of Biden's success depended less on his own campaign and more on the efforts of grassroots organizations like LUCHA, who have been organizing for over a decade trying to build Latino support. Maybe they were more in the Sanders camp during the primary, but they were all behind the cause of beating Trump in the general election.\n\nI think bringing Ana Navarro on board fit the Biden campaign's theory of the case. She maybe still even identifies as a Republican, but we know that Biden staked his candidacy on reaching out and appealing to disaffected Republicans. Because of Navarro's story - her father was a Contra in Nicaragua - there's a symbolism in her move away from the Republican Party over to Biden.\n\nI talk to some frustrated Democrats who say that given the post-election media coverage, it's almost as if Trump won the Latino vote. I think that explains why Latino Democrats and Biden's pollsters are very insistent on saying that a record number of Latinos showed up to help Biden win in critical swing states. That's their way of pushing back on the hyper-focus right now on Hispanic Republicans.\n\nI think the reason there's disappointment is that the narrative over the last forty years with respect to the Latino vote is that there's this impending surge of voters who are always about to transform American politics and benefit the Democratic Party. This year, there was a lot of talk about how a Latino becomes eligible to vote every thirty seconds, and a lot of attention to the dramatic increase in early voting among Latinos. Citing those numbers didn't say anything about how they actually voted. There was much closer to an even split between Republicans and Democrats who showed up to vote early in a state like Texas than Democrats had hoped.\n\nWe know the Democratic narrative, therefore the shift toward Trump, given all the shit he's done, is the more surprising narrative, which is why the media got carried away with it. If what the hyper-attention to Latino Republicans this time helps us do in the future is not take Latino voters for granted as Democrats, then that can be an end in itself.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Judith Stein published a piece in Jacobin titled \" A Losing Coalition .\" She noted how \"Given our identity-determined culture, demographic groups are boxed into separate categories. We speak of Rust Belt whites who need jobs, but blacks who need police justice.\" If you added Latinos to this statement, they would \"need\" immigration reform.\n\nI agree with Stein that the identitarian language we use to describe the political demands of various groups impoverishes our understanding of their material conditions. How can we demystify abstractions such as the \"Latino vote\" through a more policy-driven approach?\n\nI've been on a bit of a rant lately about how there's no such thing as \" the Latino vote.\" Every election there's this hyper-attention to critical swing states like Florida, Texas, and Arizona. When we talk about the Latino vote, we focus on those places. As a result, we're ignoring the fact that Latinos are spread across the country and make a difference in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, and everywhere they live.\n\nWe need to stop thinking about Latinos as a group of voters who are only concentrated in important swing states and start to think of them as nationally important voters.\n\nLooking at the Rio Grande Valley, one of the questions asked after the election is: are Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley in fact more like rural voters in Iowa and Nebraska than they are like other Latinos in Harris Country, where Houston is located? I think you can ask the same thing about Latinos in California's Central Valley: are they more like Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley than they are like Latinos in Los Angeles or San Francisco?\n\nThe reason you can make the comparison is that Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley are between 80 to 90 percent of the population, so they don't see themselves as marginalized outsiders or minorities in that region in the same way Latinos in other places do. They're able to think of themselves as a majority, not a persecuted minority.\n\nOnce you begin to make the comparison between rural South Texas and rural Iowa, you can ask what the interests are that bring those groups together, in terms of their economic or educational or religious beliefs. And once candidates get to know Latinos on the ground - across the country, wherever they live - they can better craft policies that respond to their needs and desires.\n\nThe Biden campaign had a national message for Latinos that was based on Trump's failed response to the coronavirus and his four years of terrorizing immigrants. These are, of course, urgent subjects - perhaps the urgent subjects. But they didn't offer a positive message about how Biden would help make life for Latinos better. I feel like this is what Chuck Rocha of the Sanders campaign has been saying all along.\n\nGeraldo Cadava is an associate professor of history and Latina and Latino studies at Northwestern University and the author of The Hispanic Republican .\n\nJaime Acosta Gonzalez is a PhD candidate in literature at Duke University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Here's how he did it.\n\nSupporters of Senator Bernie Sanders stand together during the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses at the Bellagio Ballroom in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 22, 2020.\nJoe Buglewicz / Bloomberg via Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn 2017, Belén Sisa was arrested with seven other undocumented activists for staging sit-ins inside the halls of Congress, demanding a Dream Act without additional border militarization - a \"Clean Dream Act.\"\n\nTwo years later, Sisa was named the Latino Press Secretary for Bernie Sanders's latest presidential campaign. Ugly headlines appeared in the right-wing press. \"Bernie Sanders hires illegal immigrant to be press secretary,\" read one . Undaunted, the campaign set about opening up offices in Latino neighborhoods, canvassing Latino homes and supermarkets, printing materials in Spanish, and getting Bernie's message on Latino televisions, radio stations, and newspapers.\n\nAfter an intensive year-long effort to earn Latino support, Sanders walked away with 53 percent of Latino voters in Nevada - three times as much as his closest competitor, Joe Biden, who secured 17 percent. On Super Tuesday, Sanders won 49 percent in California, compared to runner-up Biden's 19 percent. And he won 39 percent of the Latino vote in Texas, compared to 26 percent for runner-up Biden.\n\nJacobin 's Meagan Day spoke to Belén Sisa about how the campaign earned those votes, and the necessity of both good grassroots organizing and an ambitious political vision that speaks to the realities of Latino life in the United States.\n\nWere you surprised that Bernie hit it out of the park with Latino voters, or did you see this coming?\n\nI worked for Bernie in 2016. We noticed then that Latinos liked Bernie because he was speaking on the issues that so many politicians refused to talk about that they worried about every single day. But even though we knew that from experience, I never like to make assumptions or guesses. Because ultimately when it comes to organizing, you get what you work for.\n\n2020 was about scaling up, building on the foundation that we had built with Latinos in 2016. We were guided by this goal of not only having people come out to vote, but also empowering them to organize their own communities far beyond 2020. And we knew that was necessary because whether Bernie won or he lost, we were going to have to organize ourselves to win legislation like Medicare for All, free college, immigration reform.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign invested a lot in Latino organizing across the board. Latinos have been ignored for so long by the political establishment. We decided to go directly to them. As Latino press secretary it was my job to ensure that our message, our vision, and our agenda were going to Latino outlets that had that broad reach among Latinos, the places that they were already getting their news, which included buying ads in TV, radio, and newspapers, paying a lot of attention to what Chuck Rocha calls \"cultural competency.\" We also had lots of materials in Spanish and a volunteer team texting in Spanish.\n\nBut I think that where we went above and beyond was that we established a physical presence in Latino communities. We left no stone unturned. We opened our first offices in very heavily Latino neighborhoods in California, Nevada, and Iowa. We established our California office in East LA. What other presidential candidate is going to open an office in East LA?\n\nWe had small house parties in Latino neighborhoods across different regions, and we had people invite their neighbors and their family and friends. We went canvassing at local Latino supermarkets. You may have seen in pictures of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Carmen Yulín Cruz canvassing a local Latino market in Las Vegas, for example, but it wasn't just that one day. We had our organizers canvassing that supermarket every week.\n\nSo we never wanted to be too confident and say that we knew we were going to win the Latino vote, because the reality is you can never be sure that you're gonna win anyone's vote until they go out and vote for you. But we had a good feeling, because we saw the reaction to Bernie and his message in the community.\n\nI will say that in Las Vegas on the day of the Nevada caucuses, at the precinct I was at, watching people stand up and walk into the corner for Bernie, I started crying. You could tell a lot of them had never voted before, because caucuses are confusing and naturally they didn't really know what to do. It was multigenerational, young people and their parents and grandparents all standing up and walking over to the Bernie corner.\n\nIt made us so emotional. That was what we organized for. These people have been made to feel like they don't matter for so long, and they believed in our campaign and went out of their comfort zone and cast their ballot because they felt it would make their lives better. I think that shows the strength of our organizing and of our message. The political establishment has long believed it wasn't worth it to try to get Latinos to turn out, but I think we showed that isn't true and built a blueprint for campaigns in the future.\n\nI don't think the broader Left understood the extent of the appetite for wealth redistribution, universal social programs, and general Sanders-style social-democratic politics among Latinos until these last few months. Beyond just good organizing, how can we account for this phenomenon?\n\nLatinos are the fastest-growing segment of the electorate and they're mostly young, disproportionately eighteen to thirty-five. People often point out that young people in general are attracted to Bernie's politics, and that's also true when it comes to Latinos.\n\nBut also, compared to other people, Latinos are especially family-oriented, and young people are often the trailblazers in their families. A lot of our family members didn't go to college or they didn't even finish high school. Many of them immigrated here, and whatever the young people do, usually the family slowly but surely follows. This is partly why you don't see as much of a gap between the voting preferences of young people and their parents and grandparents.\n\nBut on top of that, Bernie's policies themselves speak to the issues that affect Latinos in their everyday lives. For example, Latinos are the largest uninsured and underinsured group in the country. They don't have good health care, they're seeing the impact that has on their health and their finances. Additionally, a lot of Latino families dream of sending their children to university because they didn't have that opportunity. And they're realizing that it's not going to be affordable and this causes a lot of stress. Medicare for All and tuition-free college speak directly to those problems.\n\nBernie has reached a lot of these people with the message that your struggles are not your fault. The deck is stacked against you, and we can change it. He has a lot of credit in the Latino community because he's honest and he doesn't pretend to be something he's not. He's not going to throw out a few phrases in Spanish and assume that's enough for you to feel that you can trust him.\n\nAnd that's a major departure from typical Democratic Party politics, right? It seems like the dominant approach has been for candidates to just make gestures to acknowledge the existence of Latinos without really offering anything substantive.\n\nYes, and then they point to us and say it's our fault because we didn't turn out to vote, when in reality they didn't give us much to vote for. I think that because black voters are loyal to the Democratic Party, they assume Latino voters are the same, but I can't tell you how wrong that is. A lot of Latinos think the Democratic Party is making major mistakes. And Trump has been able to take advantage of that to some extent.\n\nWe're going to see it in this election too. Trump is going to say, \"Oh NAFTA separated your family. Joe Biden supported that. I was against it.\" That will appeal to some people. Of course, others understand how bad Trump is, but they're not going to be inspired by Joe Biden. It's just like 2016. I don't want the same thing to happen again and for Trump to win, but I can't change Joe Biden's record, all I can do is issue a warning.\n\nDemocrats also make a bit of a mistake in thinking that Latinos just care about one issue and that's immigration. They do the same with black voters and criminal justice reform. Of course immigration is important to Latinos - if we're not immigrants ourselves most of us know people who are.\n\nBut when they say they want to work on immigration but ignore bread-and-butter issues, they're ignoring that immigration issues are bread-and-butter issues. The majority of undocumented people are living paycheck to paycheck because they're not being paid a living wage. Even more than most people, they don't have health care or good housing. A lot of immigration fights are actually fights about accessing benefits - if you look at the stimulus bill they're trying to pass right now, one of the huge things we're all pushing for is to include undocumented people in it.\n\nWhat were the geographical patterns of Latino support for Bernie?\n\nOur strongest showings were in Nevada and California. But even in other places across the country where we didn't have landslide wins like in some Western states, we discovered a high degree of Latino support.\n\nOne of the shocking things was that everyone said that in Florida Cuban voters would never go for Bernie, because he's a socialist and Cubans in Florida are supposed to be very anti-socialist. But he actually did pretty well with Latino voters in Florida. I think that's a huge victory, in that it shows his platform is stronger than the force of political labels. People need health care, better housing, and a raise.\n\nTexas and Arizona were also victories for us. It's not an accident that these places are known for being very anti-immigrant, very conservative, very racist. I think that this creates a different dynamic where it's harder to convince people that Trump is a unique threat. In Arizona, where I grew up, SB 1070 was passed a decade ago allowing law enforcement to racially profile people. We were dealing with this stuff before Trump was president, so don't tell me that he's the only problem.\n\nThe unique history of Cuban immigration to Florida aside, am I right to suspect that the history of egalitarian left-wing movements in Latin American countries actually makes many Latino immigrants and their families more sympathetic to Bernie's politics?\n\nI completely think it does. I've always said I think Latino voters are very sophisticated voters. The countries we come from are no strangers to social movements, and as a result of those movements we're no stranger to the concept of universal social programs to make people's lives better. And we're also no stranger to the atrocities that this country has caused in our home countries.\n\nThat's another reason Latinos were excited about Bernie. He doesn't bullshit about it the negative effects of US foreign policy on the countries where we're from. He said he wanted to work with other countries instead of barking demands at them or simply intervening in them. He said there is a reason that people are immigrating to the United States and it's necessary to cooperate to get at the root causes of the problems in those countries too. In that way I think Bernie assured a lot of people that we don't want to have to choose between here and there.\n\nHow do you think Joe Biden plans to go about securing the Latino vote, and do you think he'll succeed?\n\nSo far, I've seen a lot of disappointment among Latinos. So many went out of their comfort zone and got engaged politically, a lot of them for the first time. My mom became a citizen this past year, and her first vote was for Bernie. My hope is that they don't get disaffected, that we take everything we learned and built through this campaign and keep organizing around the issues that are not going away.\n\nLots of Latinos are heartbroken that it's not Bernie, but I haven't heard from many people about what they think of Joe Biden. I don't know the specifics of exactly what the Joe Biden campaign is doing to reach Latino voters, but what I can tell you is that it's been completely invisible. Because if I'm not seeing, regular everyday people are definitely not seeing it. I imagine it will be very grasstops, not grassroots, and that makes me worried about what will happen in November.\n\nI know there are high stakes. But at the same time, Latino votes need to be earned. So if Joe Biden is not going to voice support for the policies that would transform people's lives, and if he's going to run a regular campaign and just hold digital panels with the same leaders of the same organizations, I don't see him connecting to people who are living in the present moment and are worried about right now. I don't know how he's going to convince people to believe in him enough to vote, especially during this pandemic when we don't even know what voting is going to look like.\n\nWe're all disappointed with the outcome of the primary, but we also got some incredible information from it: Latinos are ready to vote for left-wing candidates. What should progressives and democratic socialists do now that this is plain to see?\n\nWhether in California or Nevada or Arizona or Texas or Iowa or South Carolina, where there are Latinos too, we took a big first step getting lots of Latinos politically engaged either for the first time or for the first time in a long time. Now that they've gotten a taste of what it's like, we need to continue to engage them.\n\nWe're talking about communities that are overlooked and ignored every election. They've been deemed politically untrustworthy and not valuable because it's assumed that they won't come out to vote. I think Bernie's campaign showed that if we go to them humbly and explain our political vision, they can and will.\n\nWe need to take this energy and this organizing skeleton that we've built and use it to empower people to keep organizing. But it's going to take more than just Latinos getting out of their comfort zone. Progressives are going to have to get out of their comfort zone too. Find some local organizers who've been doing immigrant rights work and work together, integrate our movements. We're all fighting for the same thing.\n\nBelén Sisa was Latino Press Secretary for Bernie Sanders 2020.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

This expectation, predicated on the idea that Latinos will naturally gravitate toward progressive politics, places blind faith in changing demographics, ignoring the hard work of political organizing and policy-driven outreach.\n\nDespite assumptions that the nativist and xenophobic forces now dominating the Republican Party would repel Latino voters, early evidence suggests that Donald Trump increased his share of Latino support nationwide. While this might seem surprising, historian Geraldo Cadava's new book, The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, From Nixon to Trump , offers an important account of how the Republican Party has cultivated support among Latinos since the 1970s. Moving beyond a limited view that typecasts Hispanic Republicans as simply Cuban exiles or conservative Catholics, Cadava traces a longer history of patronage politics and institution building that has, over time, yielded a loyal and influential base within the Republican Party.\n\nIn the following interview by Jaime Acosta Gonzalez, Cadava discusses the formation of Hispanic Republican identity, the challenges of defeating an anti-communist message, and how we might get beyond thinking about Latinos as a monolith.\n\nPeople of Latin American descent living in the United States have, over the last seventy years, self-identified in various ways: as hyphenated-Americans (Cuban-American, Mexican-American, etc.), Chicanos, Latinos, and, more recently, Latinx. The group of people you write about identify as \"Hispanic,\" and more specifically \"Hispanic Republicans.\" Can you explain the significance of this self-identification?\n\nThe ethnic labels applied to Latinos or the self-conceptions of Latinos have meant a lot of different things over time. I used the term \"Hispanic\" because it's the term preferred by the actors I wrote about, especially in the early years of the movement during the '60s and '70s. The first official auxiliary of the Republican National Committee took the name the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.\n\nI think it also means to them a connection with Spain and the Spanish Empire in the Americas. What's important about articulating a connection to Spain is how it simultaneously implies that you don't see yourself as of African or indigenous descent, and that does relate to an aspirational whiteness.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things that I learned while doing research is that Latino conservatives don't see the history of the Spanish Empire in the Americas in the same way that most of us who studied Latino history do. The version of Latino history I learned was that the Spanish Empire colonized and conquered the Americas, sowed a lot of violence, pressed indigenous groups into labor, and forced Christianity upon them. Many Latino conservatives see the presence of the Spanish in the Americas as a civilizing influence. They introduced large-scale cattle ranching and agriculture to the Southwest. They spread Christianity throughout the Americas. These are positive associations.\n\nOne of my favorite books I came across was Manuel Machado's Listen Chicano! (1978). You can kind of imagine this conservative Latino grabbing a Chicano by the lapel and shaking him saying, \"Listen here!\" It's this whole revision of Chicano history that I hadn't seen before. It reclaims the Spanish Empire as a proud tradition that all Latinos in the US should buy into. For many Hispanic conservatives, this is what the term \"Hispanic\" signifies.\n\nDo you think the \"Hispanic\" investment in civilizational grand narratives grafts quite easily onto the Republican Party?\n\nHispanic Republicans are always struggling for inclusion and acceptance within the Republican Party, and so it serves their purposes to be able to imagine themselves as people whose roots in the Americas extend back to the period even before white Europeans. Every Hispanic heritage month it comes up that Spanish was the first European language spoken in the US and that they were here for a hundred years before pilgrims settled Plymouth Rock. That is a point of pride for Hispanic Republicans.\n\nYou note that the 1964 election between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater marked the first time that a GOP candidate had done better among Hispanics than among African Americans, a trend that has remained constant ever since. In the aftermath of this election, how did the GOP leverage the gains of African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement to grow their share of the Hispanic vote in subsequent elections? In particular, how did Richard Nixon emerge as the candidate who broke through with Hispanics?\n\nThe mid-to-late 1960s is a critical moment in the turning away of African Americans from the Republican Party. Goldwater didn't support the Civil Rights Act, and the Republican Party embraced the \"Southern Strategy.\" As a result, African Americans left the party in great numbers. Therefore, Republican strategists were very explicit about their need to make up for that lost support, and Hispanics became their prime targets.\n\nWhat's interesting in your question is the idea that the Republican Party leveraged the civil rights gains of African Americans to recruit Latinos, because I think that's kind of what happened. The Republicans acknowledged that they needed to make up for those lost votes. The way they went about doing that was a divide-and-conquer strategy. The Republican Party, and Latinos who had begun to move toward the Republican Party, started saying things like \"Latinos have been loyal to the Democratic Party since the New Deal. FDR helped them put food on the table and get jobs in their time of need. How are we going to crack that?\"\n\nThe answer was, in part, asking, \"What has your loyalty to the Democratic Party gotten you?\" They also began to say that the Democratic Party cares only about African Americans, and that their civil rights strategy was only about giving them handouts. They would say, \"We know Latinos aren't like that,\" that Latinos were proud and didn't want to take government handouts, and that the Republican Party cares about you and will represent your interests.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, Latinos with conservative impulses - and I wouldn't call them Republicans yet, because they hadn't fully embraced that partisan identity - started saying that the African-American protesters were loud, take to the streets, and are disruptive, and that Latinos protested more respectfully, peacefully, and behind the scenes. That's part of the dynamic between African Americans and Latinos during the civil rights era that leads the Republican party to see opportunities with Latinos.\n\nWhat Nixon does specifically is start making high-level appointments, like the first Hispanic treasurer of the United States, Romana Acosta Bañuelos. Nixon created all of these economic agencies, like the National Economic Development Agency and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, and generally built this third plank of the Civil Rights Movement tied to notions of uplift, a \"brown capitalism\" centered around economic opportunity.\n\nThe argument of your book is that we only gain a partial view of Hispanic Republican identity by focusing on the Cuban-American experience. While it is true that Hispanics are motivated to vote for the Republican Party for a number of economic and ideological reasons, it is also true that anti-communism has remained a central feature of Hispanic Republican identity from the 1950s onward, and not just among Cuban exiles.\n\nHow have Hispanic Republicans mobilized a shared narrative about communism or socialism over time?\n\nI'm not sure how this will play with the Jacobin crowd, but in February I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled \"Will Latinos Buy Into 'Tío Bernie's' Socialism?,\" coincidentally four days before the 60 Minutes interview with Sanders where he was grilled about his earlier statements regarding Fidel.\n\nSanders supporters were upset because they thought I was saying there was no way he could win among Latinos because of the socialism issue. What I was saying was that just because Sanders had strong support in the Democratic primaries, it's not clear that support would translate to strong Latino support in a general election.\n\nThe other thing people said was that I was just talking about a small number of Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in South Florida. I think it's a mistake to put anti-communist Latinos into that box, because you miss how far and wide the anti-socialist message travels among all Latino groups.\n\nAll Latino national groups have their version of anti-communism. The Puerto Rican Republicans have always looked at the independistas , Puerto Ricans advocating for the independence of the island, as radical Marxists. There are these critical episodes in the early 1950s where activists bombed the governor's mansion in San Juan, Lolita Lebron opens fire on congress, they shoot through a window near the White House where Eisenhower was taking a nap. They are all labeled, in the context of the Cold War, as \"radical communists.\" So, Puerto Rican conservatives have their own version of anti-communism.\n\nSame thing with Mexican immigrants whose families came in the 1920s after the Mexican Revolution. They see the 1917 constitution as a Marxist-inspired document because of land redistribution and the way it stripped the Catholic church of its authority. Many Mexicans have their own version of anti-communism.\n\nI think it's a mistake to think that you can put Latino conservatives who have strongly anti-communist views into a box in South Florida, limiting it to Cubans and Venezuelans. As you note in your question, there is a much longer history dating back to the earliest days of the Cold War and continuing into the present.\n\nOne thing that's amazing to me is how the anti-communist message gets passed along from one group to another. In the 1980s, when the Sandinistas and Contras are fighting in Nicaragua, veterans of the Bay of Pigs are training Contras in Miami. Part of the reason Cuban-American politicians like Ileana Ros-Lehtinen become the champions of Nicaraguan refugees is because of the Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs trying to oust Castro. Cuban Americans said they fully understand the plight of Nicaraguan refugees because they experienced the same things two decades earlier. I think that idea gets passed down from one group to another across time.\n\nYou're seeing it play out now with how Hispanic Republicans think about the Democratic Socialists of America and people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I listened to Ted Cruz give a speech in 2018 at a gathering in DC of the Latino Coalition, an advocacy group for small business owners looking to grow their businesses and secure government or private loans. Cruz, in a single breath, mentioned Fidel Castro, Nicolas Maduro, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. It's a flat narrative about socialism that has managed to resonate for the last seventy years.\n\nI think there's this idea that now that Fidel is gone, a younger generation of Cuban Americans, whose experiences weren't defined by the Cold War, will be more progressive. That assumption underestimates how deep the narrative is. We saw how even younger Cubans supported Trump in the recent election.\n\nHow have Hispanic Republicans actively shaped US foreign policy in Latin America during and even after the Cold War? In your view, has the electoral pressure to appeal to Hispanic Republicans resulted in a more aggressive or interventionist approach?\n\nThat's interesting. I do think Hispanic Republicans have played a role in shaping US policy towards Latin America. Maybe they've even wanted to play a greater role than they have. In the fifties, one of the ways that Hispanic Republicans first started reaching out to the Eisenhower administration, for example, was by offering their services as Cold Warriors. They said that their language skills and understanding of the region's history and culture could help the United States accomplish its Cold War objectives.\n\nLater, Cubans like Jorge Mas Canosa helped shape Cuba policy, Mexican American businessmen and Hispanic Chambers of Commerce advised Republicans on trade issues, and support from Hispanic Republicans on Reagan's intervention in Nicaragua - or Trump's policies on Venezuela - certainly gave Republicans cover for inflicting violence in the hemisphere.\n\nHispanic Republicans constitute a minority within a minority. Historically, between 20 and 40 percent of Hispanics vote for the Republican candidate during a presidential election. With the appointment of Ana Navarro as head of Latino outreach, it seems like the Biden/Harris strategy was to try to persuade conservative Hispanics instead of growing the working-class Latino base that voted for Bernie Sanders during the primaries.  What do you make of this strategy?\n\nOne way to approach this is to say that Biden always found his greatest support, including during the primaries, among the less progressive-minded Latinos. What has proven true in the wake of the election is that in states like Arizona and Nevada, a lot of Biden's success depended less on his own campaign and more on the efforts of grassroots organizations like LUCHA, who have been organizing for over a decade trying to build Latino support. Maybe they were more in the Sanders camp during the primary, but they were all behind the cause of beating Trump in the general election.\n\nI think bringing Ana Navarro on board fit the Biden campaign's theory of the case. She maybe still even identifies as a Republican, but we know that Biden staked his candidacy on reaching out and appealing to disaffected Republicans. Because of Navarro's story - her father was a Contra in Nicaragua - there's a symbolism in her move away from the Republican Party over to Biden.\n\nI talk to some frustrated Democrats who say that given the post-election media coverage, it's almost as if Trump won the Latino vote. I think that explains why Latino Democrats and Biden's pollsters are very insistent on saying that a record number of Latinos showed up to help Biden win in critical swing states. That's their way of pushing back on the hyper-focus right now on Hispanic Republicans.\n\nI think the reason there's disappointment is that the narrative over the last forty years with respect to the Latino vote is that there's this impending surge of voters who are always about to transform American politics and benefit the Democratic Party. This year, there was a lot of talk about how a Latino becomes eligible to vote every thirty seconds, and a lot of attention to the dramatic increase in early voting among Latinos. Citing those numbers didn't say anything about how they actually voted. There was much closer to an even split between Republicans and Democrats who showed up to vote early in a state like Texas than Democrats had hoped.\n\nWe know the Democratic narrative, therefore the shift toward Trump, given all the shit he's done, is the more surprising narrative, which is why the media got carried away with it. If what the hyper-attention to Latino Republicans this time helps us do in the future is not take Latino voters for granted as Democrats, then that can be an end in itself.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Judith Stein published a piece in Jacobin titled \" A Losing Coalition .\" She noted how \"Given our identity-determined culture, demographic groups are boxed into separate categories. We speak of Rust Belt whites who need jobs, but blacks who need police justice.\" If you added Latinos to this statement, they would \"need\" immigration reform.\n\nI agree with Stein that the identitarian language we use to describe the political demands of various groups impoverishes our understanding of their material conditions. How can we demystify abstractions such as the \"Latino vote\" through a more policy-driven approach?\n\nI've been on a bit of a rant lately about how there's no such thing as \" the Latino vote.\" Every election there's this hyper-attention to critical swing states like Florida, Texas, and Arizona. When we talk about the Latino vote, we focus on those places. As a result, we're ignoring the fact that Latinos are spread across the country and make a difference in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, and everywhere they live.\n\nWe need to stop thinking about Latinos as a group of voters who are only concentrated in important swing states and start to think of them as nationally important voters.\n\nLooking at the Rio Grande Valley, one of the questions asked after the election is: are Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley in fact more like rural voters in Iowa and Nebraska than they are like other Latinos in Harris Country, where Houston is located? I think you can ask the same thing about Latinos in California's Central Valley: are they more like Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley than they are like Latinos in Los Angeles or San Francisco?\n\nThe reason you can make the comparison is that Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley are between 80 to 90 percent of the population, so they don't see themselves as marginalized outsiders or minorities in that region in the same way Latinos in other places do. They're able to think of themselves as a majority, not a persecuted minority.\n\nOnce you begin to make the comparison between rural South Texas and rural Iowa, you can ask what the interests are that bring those groups together, in terms of their economic or educational or religious beliefs. And once candidates get to know Latinos on the ground - across the country, wherever they live - they can better craft policies that respond to their needs and desires.\n\nThe Biden campaign had a national message for Latinos that was based on Trump's failed response to the coronavirus and his four years of terrorizing immigrants. These are, of course, urgent subjects - perhaps the urgent subjects. But they didn't offer a positive message about how Biden would help make life for Latinos better. I feel like this is what Chuck Rocha of the Sanders campaign has been saying all along.\n\nGeraldo Cadava is an associate professor of history and Latina and Latino studies at Northwestern University and the author of The Hispanic Republican .\n\nJaime Acosta Gonzalez is a PhD candidate in literature at Duke University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

By following Bernie Sanders's lead and focusing on the pressing needs of rank-and-file Latino workers, democratic socialists can continue to unleash the power of this potent voting bloc.\n\nSupporters of Senator Bernie Sanders stand together during the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses at the Bellagio Ballroom in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 22, 2020.\nJoe Buglewicz / Bloomberg via Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMuch has been made of the pragmatism of black voters (especially older black voters) as they shift decisively behind Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. But what of Latino voters? What has driven them to the polls? For generations, political scientists have routinely called the Latino electorate the \" Sleeping Giant \" - yet it is clear the giant is already awake.\n\nTo write of \"Latino\" voters is always misleading given their tremendous internal diversity. There are left-wing Mexican Americans in Texas and right-wing Cuban Americans in Florida, recent transplants and multigenerational residents. Still, it's clear from exit polls that Latinos have, as a demographic bloc, delivered wide and resounding support to Bernie Sanders. While pundits continue to talk about the inevitability of a Biden nomination, they tend to underestimate the influence of a population that has quietly shaped the contest and still has a chance to swing this election, including by staying home in November.\n\nWin or lose, Sanders has done two things that none of his opponents have been able to pull off: first, win big with Latino voters; and second, draw Latino support by speaking directly to the issues that matter to them. Studies conducted by the UCLA Latino Policy Initiative show that where Sanders has won, he's done so by targeting Latino-heavy districts, some in places where the Democratic Party never goes. For example, in the Washington State primary, Sanders carried three predominately Latino districts by more than 50 percent, giving him a boost against his competitors . In California and Iowa , his campaign targeted rural communities with Spanish-language flyers and canvassing that paid off spectacularly: some Latino-heavy areas awarded all of their delegates to Sanders. And in West Texas, despite narrowly losing the state as a whole, \"Tío Bernie\" won overwhelmingly.\n\nA Pew Research Center study points to why: 82 percent of Latinos believe that government should take a more active role in resolving social problems; 88 percent believe the minimum wage should be $15; and 84 percent believe that the government should provide health care for all Americans. All three are central to Bernie Sanders's campaign. In terms of strategy, the Vermont senator's efforts to reach Latinos early and often have paid dividends, even when it's provoked controversy, as with the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Nevada.\n\nThe spat with the union leadership proved to be an early proxy battle between the establishment and Sanders. The union leadership attempted to dissuade their membership - more than 50 percent Latino - from backing Sanders by criticizing his Medicare for All proposal and refusing to endorse him. The rank and file overwhelming went for Tío Bernie anyways, issuing a strong rebuke to the union and asserting their own interests.\n\nThroughout the primary, Latino workers have demonstrated their appetite for democratic-socialist politics. But harnessing the potential of this massive voting bloc will require drawing the right lessons from the primary and the historical record. The Nevada imbroglio exposed the pitfalls of confusing rank-and-file workers with union leadership. US Latino labor history shows that \"the endorsement\" is sometimes the least important - and most fraught - factor in achieving progressive goals. Above all, both show that left politicians should focus on speaking to the needs and aspirations of Latino workers - not simply try to build a brokerage relationship with leadership.\n\nPerhaps no Latino-oriented organization has had more influence on US politics than the United Farm Workers (UFW), founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, among others. In the UFW's heyday in the 1960s and '70s, Democrats courted the union for endorsements and touted their relationship to Chavez. But these endorsements were not always beneficial to the candidate, the party, or even the union.\n\nInitially, Chavez resisted handing out endorsements to political candidates. It was an easier call during the early years of the farm workers movement, when California governor Pat Brown pursued pro-agribusiness policies were virtually indistinguishable from his Republican opponents. All of this began to change, however, when Brown came out in favor of the movement in the mid-sixties. Chavez rewarded Brown in 1966 by backing the governor in his reelection bid against Ronald Reagan. (Brown lost the race.)\n\nBut the endorsement wasn't the only arrow in the UFW's quiver. Using a range of tactics, most importantly the boycott, the Chavez-led UFW awakened Americans to the exploitation of farm workers and reshaped politics in California and the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Organizers fanned out across the country, urging grocery stores to stop selling nonunion grapes and consumers to stop buying them. Millions obliged. Increased participation in the movement across all sectors of society and intense media coverage made it impossible for either political party to remain neutral or dispassionate about La Causa .\n\nOn a national level, John and Robert Kennedy were the first Democratic politicians to embrace the needs and desires of the farm workers as their own. As a younger man, Chavez participated in \"Viva Kennedy!\" drives for John F. Kennedy's campaign in 1960. He quickly regretted his decision when President Kennedy chose to continue the Mexican guest-worker program - the Bracero program - which impeded unionization among the mostly Mexican American and Filipino fieldworkers.\n\nChavez's suspicion of the Kennedy family relaxed when John's younger brother Bobby, then a New York senator, challenged a California sheriff's anti-union repression in 1966 as a member of the Senate's Migratory Labor Subcommittee. Two years later, the younger Kennedy joined Chavez in Delano, California to mark the end of the labor leader's first and most successful fast. Bobby's trip to the Golden State corresponded with his decision to jump into the presidential race, raising the question of whether he would ask for Chavez's endorsement. Although Chavez remained weak from the hunger strike, Bobby secured the union leader's official support through his aide, Peter Edelman. It was a wholly top-down affair: as he recuperated in bed, Chavez manufactured a vote by the UFW rank and file to support Kennedy. (The national AFL-CIO, helmed by Vietnam War supporter George Meany, endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson.)\n\nOnce he recovered from his fast, Chavez oversaw a giant UFW get-out-the-vote effort in East Los Angeles, which Kennedy credited with helping him win the California Democratic primary. Dolores Huerta, another famed leader of the union, stood at Kennedy's side just moments before Sirhan Sirhan assassinated the senator at Los Angeles's Ambassador Hotel in June 1968. The UFW's relationship with the Kennedys would be renewed four years later at the Democratic National Convention in 1972, when Ted Kennedy addressed delegates as \" fellow lettuce boycotters \" - a statement of party solidarity at a time when the UFW was battling the Teamsters for the hearts and minds of lettuce workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Chavez continued to develop ties with another political family dynasty, the Browns of California. Dispassionate endorsements of Pat Brown in the sixties gave way to a sincere, productive working relationship with Pat's son, Jerry Brown, who was elected governor in the mid-seventies. On June 5, 1975, Brown signed the Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA), which delivered state-sanctioned collective bargaining rights to farm workers for the first time in California history. Brown's aides worked closely with UFW lawyer Jerry Cohen on the bill, and Brown would later tout it as one of his signature achievements as governor. Chavez, although ambivalent about working within the law, agreed that farm workers were better off with ALRA than without it. He showed his appreciation for Brown by endorsing him for president in 1976. (Brown lost the nomination to Jimmy Carter.)\n\nWhile Chavez's endorsements of presidential candidates, including George McGovern in 1972, heightened awareness of the farm worker struggle, it dulled the union's ability to achieve what mattered most - boosting membership and worker power. When Chavez and the UFW got swept up in electoral politics, it was usually to the detriment of organizing for union election wins on farms across California.\n\nUnfortunately, the UFW never learned its lesson. Today, the UFW and its veterans, notably Dolores Huerta, continue to play the endorsement game at the expense of farm worker organizing and the wishes of younger Latinos. Huerta's support of Hillary Clinton, and her lies about Bernie Sanders suppressing Spanish-speaking at his rallies during the 2016 election, placed her at odds with a younger generation of Latino voters. This year, the UFW again failed to anticipate Latino workers' support for Sanders, endorsing Kamala Harris for president.\n\nAlthough UFW vets have not learned from the past, other Latino-oriented labor organizations have - some with headquarters in upcoming primary states. Most of the contemporary farm worker organizations, including Oregon-based Piñeros y Campesiños Unidos Noroeste (PCUN), Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), Ohio-based Farm Labor Organizing Committee , and Vermont-based Migrant Justice/Justicia Migrante (Vermont Dairy Workers) have declined to endorse to Sanders's opponents. Instead, they have focused on meeting the immediate needs of their members and building alliances with local and regional partners.\n\nIn 2016, PCUN and Migrant Justice trained their attention on immigration raids, taking their message directly to ICE offices with marches and protests. During this election cycle, Migrant Justice has concentrated its resources behind a boycott of Hannaford's Supermarket, extending the reach of the Milk With Dignity program signed with Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. They have also worked with municipal governments to pass laws prohibiting state and local law enforcement from collaborating with ICE agents in immigration roundups in Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nCIW has thrown its energy behind expanding their highly successful Fair Food Program, which uses funds from participating retail food companies to monitor conditions in the field. Notably, just hours before Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in November 2016, CIW held a \"Behind the Braids\" rally in Pennsylvania to advance the boycott against Wendy's (a non-signatory to the Fair Food Program) while Hilary Clinton held her last rally beneath Independence Hall. The Wendy's boycott remains a focal point for CIW this year.\n\nMaintaining a laser-focus on the issues affecting the day-to-day lives of their members has been their most important tool for politicizing the Latino electorate and building on previous wins for Latino people more broadly. Like many other labor organizations - and most Latino families -these institutions have a mix of undocumented and documented members and constituents. That a good portion of their campaigns seek to protect those who cannot vote is part of the reason why they have succeeded, particularly in the Trump era, where every Latino person is perceived as a threat to the nation.\n\nWhy has \"Tío Bernie\" built such a strong following with Latino voters? His message \"Not Me, Us\" is consistent with the experience of most working-class Latinos, who have been made to feel like enemies of the state, no matter if they have papers or not, if they have a union job or not, if they have medical insurance or not. His commitment to a moratorium on deportations and his promise to abolish ICE and US Customs and Border Protection puts him squarely on the side of Latinos, even as it inflames the political establishment. And although his calls for universal health care, elimination of student debt, and a $15 minimum wage have not yet resulted in the broad, multiethnic support he needs to win in states with smaller or nonexistent Latino voters, a number of upcoming states will be worth watching. The Latino electorate has been awake in Arizona since the 2016 election, helping to deliver a Democratic senator to Congress in the 2018 midterms. Georgia has seen a significant influx of working-class Latinos who, along with Asian immigrants, could shift the balance of power in that state.\n\nAs for the Culinary Union, the caucus results signal a profound misunderstanding of the source of their power. Rank-and-file members who bucked their leaders by voting for Sanders routinely cited concerns for their family or friends who did not have the union's premium health insurance. They also wondered, aloud, what would happen if they lost their jobs. Union officials, on the other hand, seemed more concerned with the perquisites that came from a union health care plan than the well-being of the broader working class. Such a position stands in conflict with a Latino community bound together by the common experience of being singled-out as rapists, criminals, and \"bad hombres.\" Solidarity , not parochialism, is their ethos.\n\nThe assumption that Latinos are malleable, gullible, or just plain apathetic misses the potency of this vast, mostly working-class population. Rather than speak down to them or ignore their concerns, Bernie Sanders has dared to see the world from their perspective. He's offered Latinos a \"small-d\" democratic vision that promises them a place at the table.\n\nAnd as with so many other things, he's offered a powerful model for future organizing drives and political campaigns, one that sees Latino workers as central to democratic-socialist politics.\n\nMatt Garcia is a historian and the author of From the Jaws of Victory: The Triumph and Tragedy of Cesar Chavez and the Farm Worker Movement (UC Press, 2014).\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet the Democrats seem to take the Latino vote for granted, as Joe Biden's platform promises to extend the criminalization of immigrants.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on September 11, 2020 in New York City.

There's plenty of evidence to give credence to the hypothesis.\n\nThe Mexican-American War of 1846, triggered by Democratic President James K. Polk under trumped-up pretexts, led to the United States annexing over half of Mexican territory. American troops returned in 1914, this time to engage in a brutal occupation of the city of Veracruz ordered by President Woodrow Wilson; two years later, Wilson sent another ten thousand troops across the border in a fruitless attempt to track down revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. In the \" repatriation drives \" of the 1930s and '40s, begun under the Hoover administration but continued assiduously throughout FDR's three-plus terms, well over a million people of Mexican descent - at least 60 percent of them American citizens - were rounded up and expelled to Mexico. The chilling nature of the raids foreshadowed the tactics to be used by Border Patrol agents and ICE in generations to follow.\n\nRecent history is more widely recalled. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was passed in 1993 by a Democratic-majority Congress and signed into law by President Clinton , who had pushed aggressively for it. Well aware of the increased migration flows the agreement was likely to cause, Clinton set about militarizing the border through \"Operation Gatekeeper\" in California, \"Operation Safeguard\" in Arizona, and \"Operation Rio Grande\" in Texas.\n\nIn addition to constructing emblematic sections of border wall, the programs effectively routed immigrants through inhospitable mountainous and desert terrain, causing the deaths of countless thousands. Clinton also signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act , which accelerated deportation procedures and set the stage for family separations, as well as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act , which created the legal infrastructure for future anti-immigrant crackdowns.\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration increased the immigration enforcement budget by some 300 percent and used it to rack up a record-setting three million deportations - more than those of all of the twentieth-century presidents combined. It also ramped up the detention of immigrant families while establishing the practice of detaining children for excessive periods of time and in prison-like conditions .\n\nAnd in the opposite direction of immigrants went guns: building on Bush-era programs, the administration launched Operation Fast and Furious , a botched gunrunning operation in which some two thousand firearms were let loose into Mexico at the height of its \"drug war\" violence. Over half of the weapons were lost; many wound up in the hands of organized crime. Due to the deaths it caused and the violation of sovereignty it entailed, the program remains a major political scandal in Mexico to this day. The Obama administration further goaded Mexico into adopting its Programa Frontera Sur project of militarizing its southern border with Guatemala, an initiative gleefully taken up in turn by the Trump administration.\n\nNone of this, of course, should be construed as letting Republican administrations off the hook for their crimes throughout Latin America: the 1954 coup in Guatemala plotted by the Eisenhower administration, the 1973 coup in Chile masterminded by Richard Nixon, the genocidal paramilitary violence unleashed by the Reagan administration in Central America, and the 2019 Bolivia coup abetted by Donald Trump are just some examples that leap to mind.\n\nIndeed, millions of Latinos in the United States fled, or are descendants of those forced to flee from countries that suffered the horrors of Republican foreign policy. What is more, the programs mentioned above - from immigrant purges to border militarization - have each been initiated, promoted, or perpetuated by the GOP in a malevolent game of catch in which the parties take turns blaming the other for starting it all.\n\nBut of the twin pillars of American imperialism, it is the Democrats who consider themselves to be uniquely entitled to the Latino vote - regardless of what they have actually done when in power. \"The Democratic Party is the natural home for Latinos,\" Terry McAuliffe announced blithely during his tenure as DNC chairman, a sentiment considered axiomatic among the party elite. Armed with this and the \"nowhere else to go\" card it uses on all minority groups and the Left, the party spent this year's presidential primary season engaging in a clumsy and often tin-eared courtship with its \"natural\" constituency, including unsolicited bursts of stilted Spanish in the debates and, as a delightful capper, candidates Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer marching into the studios of the Spanish-language station Telemundo without even being able to come up with the name of the president of Mexico, much less any substantive policy detail.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention, Hispanic speakers were noticeably absent from the proceedings, with one wit noting that there were more Republicans slotted on day one alone than Latinos the entire week. Considering the fact that Joe Biden lost the Hispanic primary vote badly to Bernie Sanders, the failure to even engage in the typical prime-time pandering is difficult to fathom. More revealing still is the fact that, despite a sustained effort by Donald Trump to antagonize the Latino community over the course of his presidency, his polling among Latinos stands at 36 percent according to the latest Quinnipiac presidential poll, some eight points better than he managed in 2016 . And when we zero in on certain states, the situation becomes even more dramatic. In Florida, for example, where Clinton won the Latino vote 62 to 35 percent in 2016, Biden is managing to lose it by four points according to NBC/Marist, a thirty-one-point turnaround.\n\nThen again, considering that the former vice president is the type of candidate that tells undocumented immigrants to get in line , shuts down immigration activists at his town halls by telling them to vote for Trump, and has a history of bragging about voting for seven hundred miles of border \"fence\" while railing about \"tons\" of drugs \"coming up through corrupt Mexico,\" perhaps we shouldn't be all that surprised.\n\nIt does not take a political sixth sense to realize that the chances of a Biden/Harris administration fundamentally altering the dynamics of militarization, private-sector intervention, and resource extraction that mark US policy toward Latin America are slim to none. As a senator, Biden was a chief architect of Plan Colombia, the murderous \"anti-drug\" policy that killed thousands, displaced some seven million more, and served as a model for spin-off plans in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Biden also engineered the Obama-era \" Alliance for Prosperity ,\" which, under the pretext of aiding distressed Central American countries to stem the flow of child migration, shoveled money into military and police budgets, thus shoring up the drug-compromised Honduran regime of Juan Orlando Hernández that came to power on the back of the very coup green-lit by Obama and the Clinton State Department in 2009.\n\nThere are even signs that a Biden administration could be still more aggressive (in Washington-speak, \" muscular \") than its predecessor in terms of its southern neighbors. In ninety-two pages of the 2020 Democratic platform , the only substantial mention of Latin America is a rejection of Trump's \"failed Venezuela policy, \"which has only served to entrench Nicolás Maduro's dictatorial regime and exacerbate a human rights and humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nA clue as to what this could entail in practice was recently given by Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, ostensibly one of the more liberal members of the Senate, who took to whining at a hearing of the foreign relations committee that Trump has botched repeated attempts to depose Maduro, including the failed coup of April 2019. On Bolivia, meanwhile, while the Áñez regime repeatedly postpones elections and represses protesters seeking to restore democracy, both the party platform and the Biden/Harris ticket have opted for cowardly silence .\n\nNor is there much to cheer for in domestic policy. Absent a grand motivating policy such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, the cancellation of student debt, or monthly pandemic stimulus payments, the campaign is banking on a smaller plate of initiatives for Latino communities which, despite a handful of valuable measures such as making the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program permanent and allowing DREAMers to qualify for Pell grants, are nowhere near as likely to muster turnout.\n\nOn immigration, as well, although Biden promises to end some of the most emblematic Trump-era abuses, such as family separation and the Migrant Protection Protocols requiring asylum seekers coming from the south to be returned to Mexico while their cases are heard, his plan does nothing to dismantle our carceral state. The criminalization of those who cross the border (the infamous Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code), as well as those already residing in the United States, promises to continue unabated, using minor infractions as an excuse to hound and deport migrants while conflating immigration with criminality. \"We've seen this before,\" wrote the immigrant advocacy group Movimiento Cosecha on Biden's plan. \"It will mean millions more deportations.\"\n\nHistorically and politically, neither the Democratic nor the Republican parties have been friends to Latin America or Latinos in the United States. This has not, of course, stopped the former from convincing itself otherwise, nor from considering itself entitled to every last Latino vote. If the presidential race tightens down the home stretch, as history suggests it will, and if the Biden campaign continues to shed Latino votes in its obsessive courting of suburbia, this attitude could prove particularly damaging in some very swing states. And for the future of the party, it bodes even worse.\n\nKurt Hackbarth is a writer, playwright, freelance journalist, and the co-founder of the independent media project \"MexElects.\" He is currently co-authoring a book on the 2018 Mexican election.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

While more fine-grained precinct-level analyses in the future will offer greater precision and nuance, on the whole, our findings suggest that the 2020 presidential election represented a further consolidation of the Democratic Party's highly educated, high-income suburban coalition at the expense of its traditional base in a multi­racial working class. What follows are some of our key takeaways.\n\nDespite Democrats' appraisal of themselves as the \"pro-diversity, anti-white supremacy\" party, Joe Biden's coalition depended, above all, on affluent, white suburban voters.\n\nBiden improved over Hillary Clinton in highly educated, mostly white, large metropolitan counties by at least twice the rate seen in other county demographics.\n\nWe looked at how much of Biden's improvement over Clinton in key battleground states came from large metropolitan, high-education counties compared to counties with large populations of white, black, and Latino working-class voters. We found that, in three of the five states examined - Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania - Biden's improvement over Clinton depended most heavily on affluent, white suburban counties.\n\nThe key exception was in Texas, where Biden's increase over Clinton accounted for a slightly larger share of the 2020 vote in counties with large Latino populations compared to affluent suburban counties. Biden's increase over Clinton in counties with large black and white working-class populations accounted for a small percentage of the 2020 vote in all five states.\n\nWhen we account for a range of other factors that might have affected Biden's improvement over Clinton, we see that education is the strongest positive predictor. We also observe, however, that Biden made advances over Clinton in progressive strongholds (many of which are also high-education counties), such as counties where Bernie Sanders performed well in the 2020 Democratic primaries, and counties that experienced increased unemployment between 2016 and 2020 (these tend to be young, low-poverty, low-homeownership, and relatively urban counties). In other words, Biden did better than Clinton not just in wealthy suburbs, but also in gentrifying urban areas.\n\nWithin large metropolitan areas, Biden did better than Clinton in nearly every county with a large share of professionals in the workforce, an above-average median income, and an above-average level of educational attainment. And his margins over Clinton improve as the share of professionals, high-income individuals, and highly educated individuals grows.\n\nWorking-class voters shifted to the right across all racial groups.\n\nDespite being helmed by a right-wing president fond of racist invective, the party of angry old white people got less white and more working class in 2020. We see attrition from the Democratic Party not just in areas with large white working-class populations, but also in areas with large black and Latino working-class ones.\n\nAfter accounting for a range of factors that could have affected increased support for Donald Trump in counties with large working-class populations, we find that factors associated with economic insecurity and low population are positive predictors across all. These include counties that are more rural, with higher rates of poverty and home­ownership (strongly associated with rural, white, and older communities).\n\nTurnout was up across the board, but weakest in working-class black areas.\n\nBoth Joe Biden and Donald Trump earned more votes than any other presidential candidates in American history. However, the increases in turnout were not even across the board. Counties with large white populations had the highest overall turnout, followed by counties with high Latino populations and counties with high black populations.\n\nWe see a similar pattern when we look at changes in turnout rates between 2016 and 2020, with the greatest voter enthusiasm coming from counties with large Latino populations, followed by those with large white and black populations.\n\nWhy do we see such large turnout increases in counties with high Latino populations? Our analysis suggests that this is due to a number of factors, including strong turnout among younger voters, higher-income voters, lower-education voters, and big increases in the South, Southwest, and West. This could also have been the result of targeted efforts by campaigns to mobilize voters in these particular areas.\n\nAmong counties with large proportions of black voters, wealthier counties saw consistently high turnout increases, while lower-income counties saw much weaker turnout increases (almost zero in counties with very large black populations). We see a similar, if less pronounced, difference in turnout changes between counties with large black populations and education levels above and below the median. Interestingly, however, we see no such trends among counties with high Latino or high white populations, where turnout increases were consistently high across class demographics.\n\nAfter accounting for a range of factors that could affect voter turnout in counties with large white, black, and Latino populations, we find that income is the strongest positive predictor of turnout in each. This indicates that, despite important differences described above, the determinants of turnout increases were relatively uniform across class. This is consistent with historical precedent, and it suggests that class was a key predictor of voter turnout in 2020 - the more affluent the county, the more Democratic.\n\nTo get a sense of the practical significance of these turnout patterns, we calculated the percentage of the 2020 presidential vote that was attributable to turnout increases in key battleground states across county types.\n\nWe find that underwhelming turnout increases in counties with large black and working-class populations across the five key battleground states examined (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas) could have significantly impacted Biden's chance of victory in each. Turnout increases in those counties accounted for a smaller share of the total statewide vote than increases in all other county types across all five states (with the partial exception of Georgia, where increases in black and working-class counties made up a larger share of the vote than in high Latino and working-class counties, though less than in white working-class or large metropolitan, high-education counties).\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Come the general election, that deep enthusiasm for Sanders will be crucial for beating Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and senator Bernie Sanders smiles at a Democratic presidential forum on Latino issues at Cal State LA on November 17, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Mario Tama / Getty Images\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Democratic Party presidential primary polls are all over the place, and the chorus asserting that you simply can't trust them is louder than ever.\n\nThere's some merit to the complaints. Twenty years ago, the response rate for pollster phone calls was 36 percent, but it's now dropped to 6 percent. Many pollsters have attempted to transition to online polls, but the practice is nascent , and its accuracy is disputed. But that doesn't mean the polls tell us nothing of use - in fact, without them we'd have very little to go on that isn't strictly anecdotal.\n\nInstead of writing off the polls entirely, maybe we should take a closer look. The information buried in the polls, beneath simple candidate preference, can tell us what candidates' strengths and weaknesses will be in the coming months.\n\nOne piece of information in particular stands out: Bernie Sanders supporters are the most devoted of the bunch by far.\n\nLook at this new CBS poll of Democrats in early battleground states. If we just observe who respondents list as their probable number-one choice, Joe Biden is in the lead with 29 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 26 percent and Bernie Sanders at 18 percent. Pete Buttigieg trails with 9 percent, Kamala Harris pulls 7 percent, and the rest hardly deserve a mention.\n\nBut that's not the only information available. The respondents were also asked to state how certain they were of their number-one choice. Bernie Sanders blew the competition out of the water. Forty-eight percent of those who listed Sanders as their preference responded that they'd \"definitely made up their mind.\" That number dropped to 35 percent for Biden supporters, 28 percent for Harris supporters, 22 percent for Warren supporters, and 21 percent for Buttigieg supporters.\n\nThese results pair well with a recent Des Moines Register /CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, which found that , overall, Buttigieg was the front-runner there, while Sanders, Warren, and Biden were locked in a dead heat for second place. We could stop there, but we'd be overlooking a key detail. The poll also found that Sanders supporters were the least likely to report that their vote was up for grabs. Fifty-seven percent of Iowa poll respondents who support Sanders said their mind was made up. None of the other top candidates even broke 30 percent.\n\nThat difference is astounding. \"There's a stickiness in his support,\" said the head of the company that conducted the poll, concluding that Sanders \"has the most fired up supporters.\"\n\nWith Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg all performing well in some polls and lagging in others, this is a data point worth paying attention to. In a close race, there is immense value in \"sticky support.\" Someone who's made up their mind this early and who's passionate about their candidate is significantly more likely to donate or volunteer. Committed supporters put signs in their lawns and bumper stickers on their cars. They talk to their coworkers and families. They canvass their neighborhoods and post on social media. On election day, every person's vote counts the same (well, sort of ), but in the months beforehand, a committed supporter brings far more value to a campaign than a passive one.\n\nNot only does Sanders have far more committed supporters in his corner, he's also built an unparalleled distributed organizing infrastructure to connect the most gung ho of them to volunteer opportunities. According to campaign spokesperson Joe Calvello, the campaign has made more than 7 million calls and sent over 63 million texts to voters, with the majority of these going into early primary and Super Tuesday states. Other campaigns are reluctant to share volunteer-assisted outreach numbers. Could it be because they pale in comparison?\n\nThe passion of Sanders supporters is why his campaign just became the fastest in history to reach the four million contributions mark - padding his campaign coffers, despite the fact that he's the only candidate whose campaign doesn't solicit money from rich donors. The top employers of his small donors are Starbucks, Amazon, and Walmart; their top occupation is teaching. All of this indicates that Sanders has a much larger army of ordinary, working-class people who are ride-or-die for his campaign than any other candidate.\n\nWe'll see what effect that enthusiastic support base - and the calls they make, the doors they knock on, and the conversations they start in their communities and immediate social networks - will have on actual vote totals in the coming months. Whether it can overcome the mainstream media's negativity toward and stubborn neglect of the Sanders campaign, as well as the influx of wealthy donor money aimed at propping up alternatives, remains to be seen.\n\nThe upshot for now is that, as candidates jockey for front-runner status, Bernie Sanders has a trick up his sleeve: his supporters don't just favor him, they believe in his campaign. If enough of them take to heart his slogan, \"Not Me, Us,\" they may give his opponents a run for their money.

The disaster proves that poverty in a rich country is a choice its government makes.\n\nJoe Biden's Child Tax Credit program expired at the end of December, and Democrats proved unable to negotiate its extension - in large part due to the spurious demands of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAccording to newly released data, an astonishing number of children have entered poverty in a very short period of time. The research , published by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, finds that America's monthly rate of child poverty spiked from 12.1 percent in December 2021 to 17 percent in January 2022 - the highest rate measured since the end of 2020. All told, the jump means that some 3.7 million more children have become poor all at once, with black and Latino children experiencing the most significant increase.\n\nThough decades of political rhetoric and social policy hokum from various think tanks has tried to muddy the waters around poverty, the cause here is both direct and undeniable. Between last July and last December, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sent out billions in economic relief to families under the Child Tax Credit program passed by Congress in March. The program, which sent payments worth $250 a month for children ages six through seventeen and $300 a month for children younger than six, represented an experiment in direct government cash transfer on a grand scale. (The size of the benefits was reduced and ultimately phased-out for higher income families.) It expired at the end of December, and Democrats proved unable to negotiate its extension - in large part due to the spurious demands of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin , who insisted any renewal come with a Dickensian work requirement and an income cap.\n\nWhile short-lived, the program's outcomes were swift and immediately measurable. According to various monthly briefs published by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the Child Tax Credit kept millions of children out of poverty every month that it remained on the books: 3 million in July ; 3.5 million in August ; 3.4 million in September ; 3.6 million in October ; 3.8 million in November ; and 3.7 million in December . As its researchers point out, the increased capacity for families to meet their basic needs also reduced hunger and had no visible impact on parental employment either.\n\nAll told, the initial passage and subsequent expiration of the Child Tax Credit is a case study in the ease and speed with which poverty can be cut through government programs. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a bipartisan continuum of conservative and liberal policymakers variously insinuated that New Deal- and Great Society-era programs were actually responsible for keeping people in poverty. Their proposed solution - to dismantle much of what was already a very fragile and incomplete American welfare state - was accompanied by a series of demeaning (and often overtly racist) cultural explanations for poverty and a range of market-based remedies to go with them.\n\nAs the recent jump in child poverty makes clear, this way of thinking is both wrong on its face and a blueprint for moral catastrophe. No one should be poor, and no one ultimately needs to be. Poverty is a political choice rather than a personal failing. And, if you want to reduce it, the solution is to give people money. It's as simple as that.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Why Are Some Latinos Drifting to the Right?\n\nJoel Martinez/The Monitor/AP\n\nOn January 6, Gabriel Garcia -a first-generation Cuban American and former member of the Proud Boys- livestreamed his attempt to breach the Capitol. \"How does it feel being a traitor to the country?\" he screamed at police officers as he entered the building. Once inside the Rotunda, Garcia yelled , \"Nancy, come out and play!\" as insurrections searched for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nGarcia was subsequently found guilty of two felony charges related to his actions that day. But a year later, he seemed unrepentant: In fact, Garcia joined a press conference in Miami to commemorate the anniversary of the insurrection.\n\nHe wasn't the only Latino there. As journalist Paola Ramos documents in her new book , Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America , the occasion drew members of the \"parental rights\" group Moms for Liberty and the Proud Boys, and many Latinos. \"If we don't agree with the left, or the media's bias,\" Garcia said at the press conference, \"we get called 'white supremacists' or 'racists.' There's nothing racist about a guy called Gabriel Garcia.\"\n\nIn Defectors , Ramos, a contributor for Telemundo News and MSNBC, investigates the \"quiet radicalization of Latinos [that] is taking place across the nation in plain sight\" and the factors behind the pull. Dispelling common stereotypes of Latinos in the United States as a unified bloc of voters allegiant to the Democratic Party and progressive values, Ramos writes that \"to understand our history, which tells us that Latinos can carry white supremacist tendencies-whether they're racially coded as white or not-is to understand that Latinos can easily act as the majority we are supposed to reject.\"\n\nI spoke with Ramos about how cultural assimilation can lead to nativism, the deep-seated anti-immigrant sentiment among some Latinos, and the shortcomings of dismissing a small but growing segment of that population as an anomaly.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clairty.\n\nIn the book, you write that \"mythologies about Latino identity ignore the very real political and cultural changes brought about by the MAGA movement's efforts.\" Why is it an oversimplification to attribute Republicans' and Trump's inroads with Latinos in recent elections to just a \"rightward shift\" from 2016 to 2020?\n\nI think the whole point of the book is that I try and force people to understand the story beneath the numbers, which is, to me, this idea that there are larger cultural, historical, and psychological forces that are driving a small-but I believe a growing number-of Latinos towards extremism and Trumpism. When you zoom into that, you see that there is this racial baggage, colonial mindset, and political traumas that we carry with us. I think what we're seeing now is the way in which Trumpism is revealing those elements.\n\nWhat are the main influences you identified as driving a small but significant number of Latinos to the right?\n\nI structured the book in three ways: tribalism, traditionalism, and trauma. Tribalism I refer to as internalized racism. Our story is also part of the story of having been colonized. With that came a caste system, colorism. What I refer to as traditionalism is the way in which colonization enforces patriarchal and binary norms. What does that mean in today's culture wars? What does that mean in today's debates around Christianity and Christian nationalism? And then what I refer to as trauma is understanding the very complicated relationship that we have with communism , but the way also that we've had very complicated relationships with strongmen rule and authoritarianism and the history of the United States' involvement in Latin America . All of those 'T's'' manifest in very complicated ways in American politics. I think the easy story is to mark us off as this liberal, progressive, united bloc. But it's actually a messy story, particularly when you understand the darker parts of our history.\n\nHow has the United States' legacy of spreading American exceptionalism in Latin America impacted the country's own ongoing \"battle with democracy\"?\n\nThe way that in this country defeating communism became synonymous with patriotism, with the ultimate definition of what it means to be an American...\n\nFrom the way that we've been involved in Cuba, Nicaragua, Chile, El Salvador , where there were these very concerted efforts to overthrow, in some more violent and other more subtle ways, elements of socialism. Now what we see is not only a diaspora of Latinos that flee from those countries, but also a United States government that reinforces the idea of Democrats being synonymous with communism, which is part of the Trumpism strategy. There's this tendency to go back to those wounds that are very familiar to Latinos. You're fleeing communism? Well, communism can also happen in the United States. This idea that when democracy feels somewhat messy in the United States, then you resort to the strongman rule.\n\nI do think the majority of people that I've interviewed do actually have very traumatic experiences with the past. I don't want to underestimate that. Where the manipulation happens is on the Republican Party side, where they've been able to really master is a way of exploiting that trauma through the spread of mis- and disinformation wars. They've also found a way to exploit that racial tension by creating this idea that there's a crisis at the border, or fearmongering criminal talk.\n\nThe first chapter of your book focuses on anti-immigrant sentiment among some Latinos in the United States, including a first-generation Mexican immigrant turned border vigilante, Anthony Aguero, who sees recent migrants as people who are vastly different from him-even a threat. A recent Axios poll shows an increase in the percentage of Latinos who say they support building a border wall and ramping up deportations. What did you learn from your reporting about what leads some Latinos to embrace nativism?\n\nThere's a blurry line. We can be minorities, but we too can perpetuate racism. Latinos, particularly the more generations are in this country, are not immune to nativism. The more we assimilate, the more we conform to American principles and the idea of \"otherizing\" is a real force, whether you're Latino or whether you're white. That's why something like the great replacement theory is so forceful and is so potent. The dynamic of nativism at its core is this idea that culture is being threatened by the \"other.\" A lot of Latinos, no matter how American you are, have to work twice as hard to prove belonging. You're third or fourth-generation Latino, but there are always these sentiments of not belonging or being \"otherized\" by fellow Americans and there's this constant wrestling with the idea of having to prove yourself.\n\nFor a small group of Latinos, that journey can become very painful to the point that you can end up with some Latinos like Anthony Aguero who become fervent anti-immigrant vigilantes along the border because they're pulled by those two notions of proving that they belong and proving that they are not like the \"others.\" It's very easy to become radicalized just to prove that you are not them .\n\nAnti-immigrant sentiment is so powerful, pervasive, and infectious that even newly arrived immigrants can sort of lean into that.\n\nDo you think extreme anti-immigrant policies-like SB 4 in Texas, which in some ways is reminiscent of SB 1070, the \" show me your papers \" measure in Arizona, and Proposition 187, which denies undocumented immigrants access to public benefits in California-can lead to backlash and reverse this trend?\n\nThis book is about a small but growing segment of Latinos. I do still think that the majority of Latinos are still more united.\n\nI think what's interesting about this moment is that I see it as a cultural reckoning. Is this the election where you have some Latinos continuing the numbers of 2020? And if that is the case, then perhaps parts of the white vote and the Latino vote are a lot more similar than not, and part of what's driving that similarity is the issue of immigration.\n\nBut I still believe that the majority of Latinos are united by this solidarity as having immigrant roots. I think of the way that Arizona turned blue because of the trauma that so many of those immigrant children experienced as they were seeing their parents being deported by Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio. I still do believe that is at the core of what will drive the majority of Latinos this November-this idea that in the face of someone like Donald Trump, Latinos have more in common against that image than not.\n\nWe're in an interesting moment where there's still a little bit of distance between the border and some Latinos, between Donald Trump and some Latinos-but the moment that it starts to creep into their own reality where potentially someone can knock at your door and racially profile you no matter how long you've been in this country, then perhaps we'll start to see a shift.\n\nYou argue that the Democratic Party has failed to see Latinos in their totality. What should Democrats do differently in 2024?\n\nI do think that the Democratic Party, at least this time, is mobilizing earlier. They're doing outreach a lot earlier than they have in previous years, they're paying a lot of attention to Spanish-language media.\n\nI always go back to: don't dismiss the small shifts, the surveys, and the polls so quickly. Don't dismiss these rightward shifts as anomalies or outliers. Because that means truly dismissing Latinos, once again, as really complex humans that carry a lot of complicated history, pasts, and traumas into this country. It goes back to this idea that Latinos are a monolith. Dismissing it can lead to results like we saw in 2020 when Trump did over 10 points better than he did in 2016.\n\nI hope that we can start to break that apart and have hard conversations about what it means to be an extremely complex, misunderstood community in this country.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "More Money, Better Stories: Why Hollywood Needs More Latinos\n\nClockwise from left: Zoe Saldaña, Jenna Ortega, and Alfonso Cuarón Mother Jones illustration; Netflix; Warner Bros. Pictures; Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty; Getty\n\n\"I was like , 'Oh, my God, look at her. She's like me; she speaks Spanish, and she has an accent like my mom.'\" That's how Mathia Vargas describes the first time she remembers seeing a Latina in an American movie: Salma Hayek in the 1997 romantic comedy Fools Rush In. \"I grew up, and we'd look nothing alike, but at the time, I was like: There's people that look like me in [an] American, English-language film.\" Vargas is a Dominican American actress from New York who-like many Latino movie and TV lovers-didn't often see people like herself on screen growing up. More than two decades later, that's still the case.\n\nAccording to research by consultancy firm McKinsey & Company released last year, which looked at movies and shows released from 2013 to 2022, Latinos held 4 percent of lead roles in theatrical films and television shows, and 7 percent on streaming series, despite making up 19 percent of the US population. That makes Latinos one of the most underrepresented groups in Hollywood; only Native American representation is similarly bad.\n\nVargas says she fell in love with acting when she was a little girl: \"I moved back to the States when I was 3, and I learned English watching Sesame Street and Barney , and I always wanted to be a kid on TV.\" But outside of those shows, Vargas says, she \"rarely saw kids that looked like me, so I never really thought it was a thing I could do.\" Still, she never let go of her dream: She became a premed student and minored in theater before deciding to pursue acting as a career.\n\nThe challenge ahead of her was clear from the beginning. She recalls a meeting with a manager early in her career-who she described as great-whose office had a wall of shows casting in New York, with every actor who could be the right fit: \"I look across this wall,\" Vargas says, \"and there's not one person that looks like me up there.\"\n\nThis lack of opportunity for Latinos in the industry isn't limited to on-screen roles; it extends to behind-the-scenes talent as well.\n\nFilms were half as likely to revolve around crime when Latinos had significant behind-the-scenes roles.\n\nThe same McKinsey study also found that 5 percent of theatrical film directors and 1 percent of broadcast and cable TV showrunners, the most senior position on television shows, were Latino. The consequences extend not only to the career prospects of Latino directors, but also to the types of stories about the Latino community that make it on screen. Hiring Latino talent off screen, the study found, leads to fewer stereotypical stories about the Latino community and to more nuanced depictions of the diverse groups that make up that community: Films were half as likely to revolve around crime when Latinos had significant behind-the-scenes roles like producer, director, or writer and 3.5 times more likely to revolve around family. \"Latino directors understand that where you come from, your ethnic background and your culture,\" Vargas says, \"influences how your character expresses themselves and walks through the world.\"\n\nAnd while opportunities for Latino talent are limited, those films Latinos lead or direct are more likely to be nominated for an Academy Award or Golden Globe and more likely to win an award once nominated, according to the study. Recent examples include Ana de Armas' best actress Oscar nomination for her role as Marilyn Monroe in Blonde and Colman Domingo, who became the first Afro Latino nominee for best actor for his portrayal of activist Bayard Rustin in 2023's Rustin . Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón have both won the award for best director, in Cuarón's case for the beautiful black-and-white 2018 film Roma , telling the story of an Indigenous live-in housekeeper in Mexico City.\n\nThe crowning irony: Despite the fact that Latinos are underrepresented on screen, they are actually overrepresented when it comes to spending on movies and TV.\n\nThe two biggest movies of 2024 were Pixar's Inside Out 2 and Marvel's Deadpool & Wolverine , both produced by Disney subsidiaries. Both made over $1 billion at the box office, and if you looked into the crowds on opening weekend, you would see a disproportionately high number of Latinos. Despite making up just under a fifth of the population, Latinos were about a third of Deadpool & Wolverine's opening weekend audience and nearly 40 percent of Inside Out 2 's.\n\nAnd that's the rule, not the exception. The McKinsey study found that Latinos had the highest per-capita spending at cinemas of any demographic, watching an average of 3.3 movies a year in theaters compared with 2.3 for white audiences. Latinos also account for 24 percent of streaming subscriptions. And the study  found that Latinos didn't just spend more, but also that movies featuring Latino talent made more money.\n\nLast year, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice had the second-highest September domestic debut in history at $110 million and outgrossed the original Beetlejuice 's total worldwide box office returns. The movie went on to become the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2024 in the United States, with Jenna Ortega in a lead role coming off her massive Netflix show Wednesday . The McKinsey study found that movies with Latinos as directors or producers or in lead roles, like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, made 58 percent more money at the global box office. Other recent box office successes with Latino leads include the last two Scream movies, led by Melissa Barrera, and Avatar: The Way of Water , led by Zoe Saldaña-who won a Golden Globe and is nominated for an Oscar this year for her role in Emilia Pérez and became the first actor in history to appear in four movies that grossed over $2 billion . Camilo Becdach was one of the researchers behind the McKinsey study, which estimated that the US film and TV industry could add $12 billion to $18 billion to its roughly $180 billion annual take if it improved Latino representation, and says it \"isn't just that more Latinos are showing up, it's that all groups are showing up.\"\n\nVargas says she's seen improvements in the types of roles now offered to Latinas compared to when she started her career more than a decade ago. \"It was rough, because I could get a sense of what they were looking for: Latinas to be sexy, to be sassy. There wasn't a lot of room for nuance there.\"\n\nNow, Vargas says, \"there's a little bit less of that stereotypical Latina. I'm auditioning to play lawyers. I'm auditioning to play entrepreneurs and romantic leads that don't feel like they're steeped in stereotype.\" She partially credits that improvement to an increase in the number of \"open ethnicity\" roles, which allow anyone to audition, but still thinks there aren't enough opportunities for Latinos, and Afro Latinos in particular. \"I'm rooting for everybody with a vowel [at] the end of their last name, but I'm not seeing enough improvement in terms of folks who make up the global majority and are darker-skinned or Indigenous.\"\n\n\"The problem is not that [non-Latinos] are playing Latinos. The problem is that Latinos are not playing anything.\"\n\nPablo Andrade is an actor from Venezuela working in New York and executive director of the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors , which works to expand the presence of Hispanic and Latino artists in the entertainment industry. \"It's hard for the general audience to understand that our community is so diverse,\" he says. \"We have Afro Latinos. We have blond Latinos. We have Latinos from all over America and all other places. For many casting directors, a Latino looks like this, sounds like this-and they are not going to find those Latinos that they have in mind everywhere.\"\n\nAndrade says his accent has been a major barrier to landing movie roles, which led him to focus on theater, and points out how Hollywood sometimes misses obvious opportunities to hire Latinos, citing the recent controversial casting of James Franco as Fidel Castro in the yet-to-be-released Alina of Cuba as an example. \"Our community was enraged,\" Andrade says. \"If we had 20 percent of the roles in Hollywood-that guy's a fantastic actor. Give it a try. A Latino could be played by anyone. But the problem is not that they are playing Latinos. The problem is that Latinos are not playing anything.\" The film's producers, that is, could have given a Cuban actor the opportunity to progress in their career instead of going with Palo Alto Fidel Castro.\n\nHiring more Latinos, based on the study's results, would likely net more money for an industry that has struggled to bring revenue back to pre-pandemic levels and yield better stories for us to watch. But convincing studios of that is a challenge. Becdach sees many reasons. One is that studios often determine whether they are willing to fund a movie based on \"comps,\" other projects that they can point to as comparable to the one being pitched. That presents a challenge for Latino creatives: They have fewer projects to point to because fewer Latino-led projects have been greenlit in the past. As one Latino animator interviewed for the study put it: \"It's the chicken-and-the-egg problem: Because there are no hits, they don't want to make Latino movies. And because they don't make Latino movies, there are no hits.\"\n\nThe other major challenge for Latino creatives is that, perhaps more than any other industry, the film and TV business relies on people hiring those they know. One non-Latino executive interviewed for the study said: \"There are no applications for production jobs...A studio head hires division heads, and the division heads hire other people [they] know, and this cycle perpetuates-and as a result, Latinos don't get hired.\" Entry-level positions are often given to those with university or family connections in the industry, which many Latinos lack. One possible solution is to have more Latinos in creative leadership positions; the study found that when Latinos are in these roles, they are 15 times more likely to hire Latinos than are their white counterparts. \"When you have [a] Latino producer [or] director, you'll see greater representation on screen,\" Becdach says. But that's another Catch-22, because studios have to first be willing to hire Latinos into those positions. Becdach says Hollywood studios should be thinking of ways to create a pipeline for Latino talent to network and receive mentoring so that more can eventually get into leadership positions.\n\nAs with any creative endeavor, mistakes are going to happen; not every movie or TV show will accurately represent every Latino group, and not every story featuring Latinos will be great, but more opportunities will mean more and better stories. \"I know it's hard to get it right,\" Vargas says. \"But we just want to be in there. Let us be the good guys, the bad guys, maybe less of the bad guys. I would like to see quantity and quality.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Latino Pol Is Tough on Immigration, to GOP's Delight\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji_hZetz6fw\">La Revista Magazine</a>/YouTube\n\nThis story first appeared on the New America Media website.\n\nOn a Sunday, in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise, state legislator Steve Montenegro stands behind the pulpit and preaches with confidence.\n\n\"Hermano, hermana, en su vida él no va dejar que se burlen de usted,\" he says in Spanish before transitioning into English. \"Brother, sister, in your life he won't let anyone put you to shame.\"\n\nAn audience of about 40 people, mostly Latino, listens to him attentively as he punctuates every sentence with a wide smile.\n\nIn his second term in the Arizona state Legislature, the 29-year-old immigrant from El Salvador is the only elected Latino Republican in the Arizona House, and politicos on both sides of the aisle view him as a rising Republican star. Montenegro, who is running for reelection in 2012, is the product of a national effort by Republicans to recruit and train more Hispanic candidates for office-including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez-because they say Latino voters are shifting to the right.\n\nConservative Latinos praise him for immigrating legally, \"the right  way,\" as others called him a vendido , or sell-out, for supporting  legislation like SB 1070, which makes it a state crime for unauthorized  immigrants to be in Arizona. (Federal courts have stayed key parts of  the law, pending a final decision on its constitutionality.)\n\nMontenegro said he never mixes politics with his role in the church  and vice-versa. But his family's church, the name of which he asked not  to be mentioned in this article, has been an integral part of his life. He grew up looking up to his father, a Pentecostal pastor, speaking  Spanish, and watching immigrant families like his struggle to make ends  meet. \"That's where my values come from,\" he says. \"It's who I am.\"\n\nThis is precisely why he thinks he doesn't need to try hard to understand the mindset of Latinos. In an interview at a local coffee shop, Montenegro says he gives  voice to conservative Latinos with strong family values and prudent  economic views who are tired of the hypocrisy of politicians from both  parties. He says he is on a mission to fight stereotypes held by many,  including some fellow Republicans. \"(Latinos) would rather be in the sun on top of a roof in Arizona,  120 degrees, working hard, than showing up to the welfare office,\" he  said.\n\nMontenegro, a brown-skinned man with short dark hair, has the  demeanor of a meticulous businessman: calm, soft-spoken, and extremely  measured when talking to reporters. He says he is satisfied with his  current political career and doesn't have his eye on a specific  political post. Where his career goes \"is going to be up to the voters  and up to God,\" he said.\n\n\"My calling is to serve. I'm a minister and I'm called to serve in  that,\" he said. \"But I'm also...I believe with all my heart, that I've  been called to serve the conservative, the cause of freedom.\"\n\nBy \"freedom,\" he means less big government. And by \"being free,\" he means taking responsibility and working hard. \"People love the fact that when I tell them, 'I really stand against  government oppression and big government,' they believe me,\" he said. \"Because I  was born in El Salvador, my parents have seen what a big oppressive  government would do to you.\"\n\nMontenegro's family arrived in Los Angeles when he was four years  old. He is uncomfortable discussing his immigration history, which has  long drawn the curiosity of many Phoenix Latinos. El Salvador was in the  middle of a civil war when Montenegro and his family immigrated. His  family did not seek political asylum or a church sponsorship, he said.  Instead, he said, his father applied for legal residency through a  family member who already lived in the United States.\n\nAt the time the family immigrated to the United States, Montenegro's  father was a pastor in the Iglesia Apostólica de El Salvador, a growing  denomination of Pentecostals in Latin America. \"My father said, 'If it's meant for us to be, if God wants us to go,  we are going to get the paperwork,'\" Montenegro said. \"'If not, we are  not going. I'm not going to put my family through the heartache that it  is to try to come to this country undocumented or illegally.'\"\n\nHis family lived in Colorado, Michigan, and Canada throughout his  childhood, until they settled in Arizona and his dad began preaching in a  church in Surprise.\n\nMontenegro remembers learning English in kindergarten, but Spanish  was the main language spoken at home. That didn't prevent his family  from wanting him to assimilate with non-Latino cultures, he said. \"Being an American to them, it wasn't about segregating,\" he said.  \"They didn't embed in me, 'You are brown, you have to be this way.' No,  they embedded, 'You're a child of God, you are a student, you have to be  the best. El mejor hijo de Dios' (the best son of God).\"\n\nGrowing up, Montenegro took jobs to help the family. When he was 14,  he worked for a few weeks helping with yard work with some people from  the church but said he had to quit because he couldn't take the extreme  heat of Arizona. At another point he got a job as a busboy. He became an assistant youth pastor to his father. He spent five  years as president of Arizona Messengers of Peace, a group within the  Apostolic Assembly that provides counseling and guidance for youth.\n\nBut he had his heart set on becoming an attorney. He graduated from  Arizona State University with a degree in political science and took an  internship with Republican Rep. Trent Franks, thinking he could  get a letter of recommendation from him to go to law school.\n\nHis eyes grow teary as he remembers his father's advice when he was studying to take the LSAT. \"Hijo, ocúpate de lo posible. Y déjale a Dios lo imposible. Él es  especialista en lo imposible,\" his father told him in Spanish. (\"Son,  take care of the possible. Leave the impossible to God. He specializes  in the impossible.\")\n\nHe did well on the test, but politics found him before he started law school. He was recruited by a Republican political consultant during a  luncheon in February 2008, where his boss Franks was a keynote speaker. The consultant, Constantin Querard, president of the political  consulting company Discessio, LLC, says he immediately saw something in  Montenegro. \"I try to recruit more  minority candidates in the Republican Party-it's the right thing to do,  particularly with Latino voters; their natural tendencies in so many  issues line up so well with Republicans,\" he said. \"The problem is that we don't  have a very good messenger...and we have almost no one who can deliver the  message in Spanish.\"\n\nQuerard said that people like Montenegro help fight against negative  and incorrect stereotypes about the GOP, especially when it comes to  immigration issues. \"Steve hopefully is the face of the future of the party,\" Querard  said, \"and when other aspiring Latino candidates look at Steve, it will  inspire them to recognize it's very possible.\"\n\nMontenegro has risen quickly through the ranks in the state Legislature and is currently the speaker pro tempore. He is the candidate that Latino Republicans like Haydee Dawson were looking for. \"His story is the epitome of the American dream,\" said Dawson, a  33-year-old financial consultant in Mesa who also migrated from  El Salvador when she was young. \"He is part of a new generation of  Republicans.\"\n\nAlice Lara, a spokesperson for the Arizona Latino Republican  Association (ALRA) and host of the talk show Radio ALRA on KKNT 960 AM,  agrees. She said Montenegro also offers Latino Democrats who are  pro-life and conservative someone who aligns better with their values.\n\nBut not everyone is buying into the new, browner image of the Republican Party. \"They're using folks like Montenegro to try to give themselves a  different image,\" Democratic state Sen. Steve Gallardo said  about the GOP. \"Unfortunately, the vast majority of Latinos are going to  look right through that disguise.\"\n\nGallardo points out that Montenegro wouldn't win in a district like  his, where the majority of voters are Latino. He said it is mostly white  conservative voters who have given Montenegro support. Latinos represent nearly one-third of Montenegro's district. With a  total population of 378,298, Montenegro's is the largest district in the  state, according to the 2010 Census. \"I don't care what his last name is; he is not representing Latinos,\" Gallardo said.\n\nQuerard said people on the left wish politicians like Montenegro  would go away because they destroy their argument that state immigration  policies are driven by an anti-Latino sentiment. \"They can't fight that rising tide,\" said Querard. \"He is the first but there'll be very many like him.\"\n\nEye of the Storm\n\nBefore SB 1070, Montenegro supported a  number of other controversial  initiatives that put him in the eye of the  storm. He was the sponsor  of HB 2281 to ban ethnic studies classes,  arguing that they promoted  the overthrow of the American government. The  bill, signed into law by  Gov. Jan Brewer, is being used to try to  dismantle a specific program  in the Tucson Unified School District that  focuses on Chicano studies.\n\nMontenegro was also the major force behind a ballot initiative in   Arizona to end affirmative action, which resulted in a decrease in   funding for women's education programs.\n\nHe said he gets frustrated with the argument that all Latinos' views  are monolithic or are pro-illegal immigration. \"I think it's wrong to  attribute illegal immigration to the Latino  community,\" he said, \"when  the fact is that the majority of Latinos in this country  and in this  state are people that have followed the laws and are here  legally.\"\n\nAt his office at the State Capitol, he reads aloud an email in   Spanish that was sent to him by a woman who identified herself as a   legal immigrant in the border town of Nogales. She writes that she  supports SB 1070 and goes on to say that she sees  with sadness that the  underage gang members in her son's school are the  children of \"illegal  immigrants.\" A letter read by Republican Sen.  Lori Klein on the Senate  floor sparked controversy earlier this year by  drawing a similar  comparison.\n\nMontenegro's perfect Spanish has made him a virtual spokesperson for   SB 1070 on the Latino airwaves, fielding questions that it would lead  to  the use of racial profiling against dark-skinned people. \"This is an  issue that every country deals with,\" he said. \"For people to   automatically say this is a racist issue, I feel that is wrong.\"\n\nMontenegro says SB 1070 has been widely misunderstood. It didn't   create a new immigration standard, but would have made police enforce   the federal immigration laws already on the books by bringing uniformity   to police enforcement, he said.\n\nSeveral federal judges disagreed with Montenegro's assertion by   enjoining most key provisions of SB 1070, saying the state law intrudes   into federal immigration enforcement. Still, Montenegro doesn't think  the immigration system is broken. \"The process is there and there are  millions of people that can  attest to it working,\" he said. \"Can we  make it better? Absolutely.  Let's do that. That's out of my hands;  that's in Washington.\"\n\nHe says he would be open to increasing the number of visas available   for people to come to this country legally, and review the costs and   expedite the process for those who have been waiting for many years to   migrate. But he says he doesn't support any form of amnesty. \"This  country has a big heart,\" he said. \"The problem is when the rest of the  world wants to take advantage of that.\"\n\nMontenegro doesn't see a solution in legislation like the DREAM Act, a   bill currently in Congress that would create a path to legalization  for  young people who came into the country before the age of 16 and  have  enrolled in higher education or the military. He said enrolling in  the military and giving their lives for the  country is a noble cause,  and no one would argue that someone should not  get legal status because  of that, but \"you can't equate that with other  things like a student  going to school.\"\n\n\"I think it's biased to be thinking of one group of people only, when   20 years from now you're going to have the same problem,\" he said.\n\nHe said Latinos should be outraged at Obama for not fulfilling his   campaign promise of tackling immigration reform and then trying to blame   the failure on Republicans. \"Well, Mr. President, you have two years  of all Democrats, both House  and Senate. You promise something, you had  the power to do it then,\" he  said. \"I'm not advocating for what he  promised, but I'm just holding  his feet to the fire. And what did he  do? Nothing.\"\n\nMontenegro says he wants it to be clear that as a politician he   doesn't speak for the church. No matter how much he has tried to keep   the two separate, his connection to the church came under fire last   year.\n\nCarlos Galindo, a political commentator for the Christian station   Radio KAZA 1290 AM, said he has gotten several calls from upset people   who claimed they were undocumented members of his church and said they   had helped pay for Montenegro's education. \"He says he doesn't know if  they're undocumented or not, but he  allows it because they're flock and  they go to his church-but he has a  problem with them on the streets,\"  said Galindo. \"There's hypocrisy.\"\n\nMontenegro categorically denied those allegations, saying he got   funding for his education through scholarships, loans, and help from his   family. \"At church we never ask people what their status is,\" he said,  adding that politics are not part of the conversation either.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant who claims to be a former member of the church spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"It hurts me that he knows what are these people's needs and he   continues to try to oppress them,\" said the source, who left the church a   year and a half ago in protest of Montenegro's political stance  against  undocumented immigrants. \"He has forgotten that undocumented  immigrants  have family members that are not undocumented and can vote.\"\n\nMontenegro said when he took a stance in support of SB 1070, he   didn't do it as a minister or a pastor. \"I did it as a legislator,\" he   said. \"You can't unite the two things. At church is not about politics.   It's about salvation.\"\n\nOn this Sunday morning, he preaches about finding joy in the midst of   oppression and finding strength through faith. On the church walls  hang  cardboard signs with the messages of the service: \"Oppressed Go  Free,\"  \"Undo Heavy Burdens,\" and \"Break Every Yoke.\"\n\n\"The reason why we are, the reason we live, is to serve him,\" he says from the pulpit, as people burst into applause.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How a Drastic Drop in Latino Support in California Could Cost Democrats the House\n\nNoah Lanard November 4, 2024\n\nLeft: Farmworkers on a farm in California's Central Valley. Right: John Duarte, US representative for California's 13th Congressional District Mother Jones illustration; Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty; Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Getty Getty\n\nLeft: Farmworkers on a farm in California's Central Valley. Right: John Duarte, US representative for California's 13th Congressional District Mother Jones illustration; Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty; Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Getty Getty\n\nKeyes, California, is not the typical town in which a Republican spends the precious final days of a close campaign. It is a working-class community of fewer than 6,000 between Merced and Modesto where about two-thirds of people are Latino and 6 percent of residents have a bachelor's degree.\n\nYet six days before the election, John Duarte, the incumbent Republican member of Congress, was going door to door there to make his case to voters of both parties. Duarte was hoping to capitalize on what polls have shown is a startling decrease in support for Democrats among California Latinos. The largely positive reception he got at the doors suggested he was right to try.\n\nIn 2020, pre-election surveys and exit polls showed Biden winning Latino voters in the state, the large majority of whom are of Mexican ancestry, by about 50 points. Three recent polls in a row from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, including one released on Friday, show Harris up by less than 25 points among Latinos.\n\n\"This year is different,\" Mark DiCamillo, the IGS poll director, explained about California. \"It used to be that Latinos were reliably Democratic in just about all elections with 70 percent or more [support].\"\n\nAs a result of Democrats underperforming in the state in 2020 and 2022, there are five toss-up seats in the House held by Republicans; Latinos account for a significant share of the population in all five districts. In two, the 13th and the Central Valley seat immediately to its south represented by Rep. David Valadao, they constitute between about 50 to 60 percent of eligible voters. Winning back some of these seats will likely be essential for Democrats to take back control of Congress.\n\nIn 2022, Duarte-a farmer of Portuguese and Swiss ancestry whose family runs one of the largest plant nurseries in the country-won by just over 500 votes. He now has a rematch against Adam Gray, the former state Assembly member he defeated two years ago.\n\nCovering large swatches of the San Joaquin Valley, the heart of the United States' fruit and nut industries, the district voted for Joe Biden by 11 points in 2020. This year's face-off should normally be an easy Democratic pickup in which higher presidential election turnout carries Gray to victory.\n\nBut everyone I talked to considered the Gray-Duarte race essentially a coin flip.\n\nFor Latino voters in California, \"We are seeing voting trends and registration move in a rightward direction that I have not seen in 30 years,\" Mike Madrid, a co-founder of the never-Trump Lincoln Project and a former political director of the California Republican Party, told me.\n\nPolls continue to show a clear majority of Latino voters backing Democrats statewide, and Madrid cautioned that polling during the failed 2021 effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom showed a drop off in Latino support that proved to be a \"mirage.\" But something does seem to be changing. \"As somebody who watches this like a hawk,\" Madrid emphasized, \"I've never seen it before. But that doesn't mean that it won't snap back.\"\n\nOne person who appeared less concerned was Gray, Duarte's opponent. When we met at his Merced campaign office this week, I asked him what he makes of the signs Democrats in the state are losing significant support among Latino voters. Gray brushed off the question. \"I think it's a Washington conversation,\" he told me of the concerns.\n\nNone of the Latino elected officials and political consultants in California I interviewed responded similarly. They said they have seen firsthand that many fellow Latinos, particularly men, appear more willing to vote for Republican candidates this year. The most recent IGS poll showed Harris winning Hispanic men by only about 10 points, compared to 36 points among women. (It also showed a major drop in Democratic support among Asian American voters since 2020.)\n\nPedro Ramirez , a Democratic political consultant and community leader in Fresno, warned that the first question heard from younger Latino Democrats contacted by local campaigns was often: Who is the candidate supporting for president? They were hoping to hear Trump's name. It happened so often that Ramirez started to think there was an issue with their data and they might not actually be talking to Democrats.\n\n\"We look and, no, they're not. The data is fine,\" Ramirez added. \"It's that some of these folks have moved more to Trump.\"\n\nAs he knocked on doors, Duarte's pitch to voters was fairly simple: I'm your congressman. I'm a farmer. I want to make gas and groceries cheaper. He was hitting the right message, even if Donald Trump's promised tariffs and mass deportations would likely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis. Across party lines in the Central Valley, the increased prices of gas, food, and housing were by far the most important issues mentioned by the voters and Latino political experts I interviewed.\n\n\"People are frustrated, rightfully so,\" Assemblywoman Esmeralda Soria, a Democrat who represents much of the area Duarte does, told me. \"People are struggling. Everything's much more expensive. Wages haven't kept up. I think that that's what's going on. People don't feel that either party is doing it for them.\"\n\nThe basic act of Durate showing up clearly resonated as well. \"So, you're just going around?\" a surprised woman in her twenties asked Duarte. \"That's really cool. I like that.\"\n\nSoria said the congressman has worked hard to win support in small communities in the district. \"People have not knocked on their doors. They haven't been reached out to,\" she explained. \"The congressman made a very intentional decision to engage some of these small city mayors early on and he got them earmarks.\" The result is local leaders who are endorsing Duarte over Gray, while also backing Soria, their Democratic state representative.\n\nAt another door, an older woman told him that she used to work for Duarte's plant nursery. She added to me in Spanish, which Duarte largely doesn't speak, that she had traditionally voted Democrat but backed Duarte during his first run for Congress in 2022 and that she was planning on doing so again because she wanted to support her old patrón, her boss.\n\n\"There are five votes in that house,\" Duarte told me as we walked away. \"They're voting for me because she worked for me.\" It didn't surprise him. It happened pretty often, he said.\n\nThe exchange reflected something that Gustavo Arellano, the Los Angeles Times writer well known for his old OC Weekly \"¡Ask a Mexican!\" column, had told me about the neighboring 22nd District, the other tossup race in the valley in a majority Latino area. The incumbent Republican is Valadao, another farmer whose ancestors are from the Azores. His challenger, Rudy Salas , is the son of a farmworker and a former Assembly member.\n\n\"It's like, yeah, [Valadao is] Portuguese. But he's a farmer, which means he's a person who ostensibly knows how to run a farm, at least in the minds of voters,\" Arellano explained. Salas comes from a farmworker family. \"So, implicitly, it's like, 'He's just a worker. Well, we don't need workers. Having a worker is not going to better our lives. We need someone who has experience.' It's kind of fucked up but we'll see [what happens].\"\n\nMayor Victor Martinez is one of the Democratic elected officials who have endorsed Duarte. Mendota, the city of about 12,000 he represents, is in the more isolated western end of the valley. Like many in town, he is a Salvadoran immigrant who initially did farm labor with his parents after arriving in the country as a child.\n\n\"I think that people are tired and finally figuring out how government affects their day to day,\" Martinez said about the shift he sees away from Democrats in his community. \"It's not a lie that gas prices are way up. It's not a lie that a lot of these business policies in place to protect the environment are choking small businesses.\" He owns a small trucking business and fears what will happen if California forces people like him to buy expensive electric trucks. \"Who can afford to do that?\" he asked. \"Huge companies. Corporations. Not us.\"\n\n\"Our people are very hard-working people, but I think they're getting tired of what's going on,\" he continued. \"So, I'm a Democrat. But I decided right now I'm not going to be a sheep anymore.\" He saw Democrats as too often treating Latinos as victims instead of empowering them.\n\nMartinez credited Duarte with securing $5 million to repave the roads in his city. At the same time, he is splitting his ticket by supporting Soria in her reelection bid. \"I'm going to support those that have common sense policies that will support our people,\" the mayor explained. \"And not just make people happy by just bringing them a food bank, and then more food banks. Killing jobs. And then more food banks.\" He preferred not to discuss who he was voting for in the presidential race.\n\nJesús, a Mexican immigrant from Jalisco who works in construction, answered one of the last doors Duarte knocked. He told the congressman that he used to be a Democrat but was now a committed Republican. After Duarte and I parted ways, I went back to talk with him some more.\n\nHe told me that he'd crossed the border illegally in 1986 on the day he turned 18, then later gained legal status-and eventually citizenship-from the amnesty Ronald Reagan signed into law that year. He recalled that his father-in-law and others he knew voted Democrat: \"So I said, 'Yeah, okay, I'm gonna give them my vote.'\" But, in 2020, he voted for Trump. He liked his economic record and concluded that Republicans' values aligned more closely with the ones he holds as a devout Christian.\n\nHis 25-year-old son, Zadrac, was at the house that night. He has an MBA, works as an accountant, and finds himself unsure about how to vote. \"A couple of years ago, I was like, 'I'm never going to vote for the Republicans,'\" Zadrac explained. \"But I know this upcoming election, I'm more on the fence about it.\"\n\nLike his dad, he felt that Democrats often did not share his Christian principles. Still, he was concerned by some of the supporters Trump attracted. \"The people that are going for him, they seem kind of racist,\" he explained. \"They may be opposed to people like me. So it makes me wary. Why would you vote for someone if the people that are supporting him don't seem to care about you?\"\n\nZadrac's attitude was common. Many of the Latino voters I spoke with who are considering voting Republican were aware of the nativism-and sometimes overt racism-of MAGA. Even if they are Mexican American, they don't like seeing Puerto Ricans being called \"garbage.\" But for many, other issues seem more important this year.\n\nDuarte has gone out of his way to differentiate himself from Trump to allow Latinos to move to him. His rhetoric is nothing like the former president's, and he supports a path to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants. I told Duarte I was skeptical that right-wing Republicans, who have tanked multiple bipartisan immigration reform bills in recent decades, would ever allow such a path. \"I can't convince them,\" Duarte said of his colleagues. \"Donald Trump can.\"\n\n\"I think as he turns a lot of Hispanic votes this time, he's going to say, 'This is a durable majority if I address their needs,'\" the congressman said.\n\nRamirez, the Fresno-based political consultant and community leader, said messaging about Trump's promises about mass deportations and other immigration crackdowns often does not resonate with the Latino voters in the area. Many believe Trump is talking about other people, or thinks that he won't actually follow through on his campaign promises.\n\nHe tries to explain that Trump's immigration agenda was often blocked by Congress or the courts, and that a second term would be different. \"Nah, I think he's saying it just to get elected,\" Ramirez, who is himself undocumented, said about what he hears in response. \"You'll see, once he gets elected, he'll be fine.\" Many of these voters want progressive immigration reforms but they've lost faith that Democrats will ever get them done.\n\nMore surprisingly, Ramirez said some of the Latino voters he talks to even respect Trump on immigration despite not liking what he did. \"They might not agree with what he did in terms of the deportations and enforcement mechanisms. [But] people will say at least he actually acted on what he said he was going to do,\" Ramirez explained. \"Whereas again, the Democrats have yet to deliver on immigration.\"\n\nIn 2022, Duarte and Valadao's districts had some of the lowest turnout in the country. Only about 100,000 people voted in the Valadao race, compared with more than 350,000 in the nation's highest-turnout congressional races. (Members of Congress each represent nearly 800,000 people, although the number of eligible voters varies by district.) And of the 25 races with the lowest turnout, Duarte and Valadao were the only Republicans who won two years ago.\n\nIn an effort to boost turnout, Grita Canta Vota, a nonpartisan campaign, organized a free concert in Visalia on Thursday. It was part of a well-funded and highly produced national tour called Vota Palooza that has been coming to Latino communities where there are close races. Los Tucanes de Tijuana, a veteran norteño act with a major following, was the headliner. Thousands attended.\n\nOutside the venue, organizers had set up a little plaza featuring mariachis, food, and lowriders. Most of the people I talked to, particularly women and those who were older, supported Harris and fellow Democrats. The disgust with Trump I heard from one of them, a Latino man originally from Oakland, was visceral.\n\nBut Sara, a 38-year-old life insurance agent originally from Mexicali, was at the other end of the spectrum. Her husband couldn't understand why but she was voting for Trump. She said the economy was by far the most important issue for her and she thought Trump would handle it better.\n\nInside the venue, the crowd filled in as Lupita Infante and Grupo Control opened for Los Tucanes. In between the sets, speakers tried to make sure they planned to vote. One of these exhortations came via a video message from Dolores Huerta, the legendary labor leader who helped to organize the era-defining 1965 grape strike with Cesar Chavez in nearby Delano. \"If we vote, we can prevent that horrifying future,\" Huerta, now 94, stressed in Spanish wearing a flat-brim hat. \"Because we're the winners: Latino people, people of color, all the young people fighting for a better future.\"\n\nMost of the people in attendance had not been born when Huerta and Chavez became icons. In many cases, neither were their parents. The movement Huerta emerged from is increasingly distant.\n\nI ran into Ramirez, the political consultant, later that night. When we'd spoken earlier in the week, he'd stressed the potential electoral consequences of Latino voters in the area struggling to get by. \"That's really what most voters are looking at right now is that: their actual bank account,\" he said.\n\nHe has a master's degree in public policy and runs a nonprofit when he isn't being paid to elect Democrats. But the issues aren't abstractions for him. \"Honestly,\" he explained about his own life. \"I'm trying to buy a house, and it's like, I can't even afford it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Vámonos! An Unprecedented Latino Voter Drive Could Tip the Scales in Iowa\n\nJoe Henry, president of LULAC of Iowa, with Democratic presidential candidate Gov. Martin O'Malley League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa\n\nAcross Iowa, thousands of Latino voters are getting the same call. \"It is important the Latino community participate in the presidential caucuses,\" a young Latina woman says on the robocall. \"If we don't participate in the Iowa caucuses, then everyone else gets to decide for us what issues are important and which candidates will address those issues.\"\n\nA total of 50,000 Latino voters are receiving direct mailings bearing similar messages, and 25,000 are receiving robo and live calls encouraging them to caucus on February 1. For those living in the 20 Iowa counties with the highest concentration of Latino voters, they are getting knocks on their door and caucus training opportunities in their communities. It's all part of an ambitious effort to organize Iowa's Latino population into an influential voting block in the caucuses next month. \"People will be surprised,\" predicts Joe Henry, the man spearheading the effort. \"I think you're going to see a little history here.\"\n\nHenry's plan is the first time that there has been a targeted effort to engage Latino voters in the Iowa caucuses. If the majority of those who turn out caucus for a Democrat, the effort could help decide the tight race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders-and thanks to the large number of young people in the Latino community, Sanders may reap the benefits.\n\nHenry, a real estate agent with decades of political organizing under his belt, met Mother Jones in downtown Des Moines at Ritual Café, a Latina-owned coffee house that only sells vegetarian and vegan fare. There's a Bernie Sanders sign posted in the window and a stack of \"FeelTheBern\" and \"Bernie2016\" bumper stickers inside, along with the latest edition of Hola Iowa , a local paper that prints stories side by side in both English and Spanish. The Vermont senator, who gave an exclusive interview to the paper, graces the cover.\n\nA year ago, Henry began shopping a plan to engage and turn out Iowa's Latino voters in the Iowa caucuses. A board member of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the oldest civil rights organization for Latinos in the United States, Henry says he spent months going to major, national Latino organizations looking for funding. LULAC is a nonpartisan organization and is training Latinos how to navigate both the Democratic and Republican caucus processes. The organization reached out to the campaigns of Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush to partner on caucus training-only the Bush campaign responded and joined forces with LULAC to host training sessions. But Henry's efforts were successful in Iowa. Eventually, he was able to bring in enough donations that LULAC put $300,000 into his plan. Starting in October, he began to organize.\n\nLULAC's Iowa team has identified about 50,000 registered Latino voters in the state-and they are targeting them with a message that is repeated in robocalls and mailers: If you don't participate, someone else will. \"There's a little bit of guilt instilled into that\" message, says Henry. \"Many of us have that Catholic upbringing-guilt definitely works in many Latino families to get people engaged in the process.\"\n\nHenry believes LULAC's effort will bring out between 10,000 and 20,000 people to caucus on Monday. The majority of these voters will likely participate in the tight race between Sanders and Clinton. Though Clinton is the preferred candidate among Latino voters-a national poll from NBC this month showed her leading 54 percent to Sanders' 33 percent-Henry's effort may ultimately result in more voters for Sanders than Clinton. That's because Iowa's Latino population is overwhelmingly young. And in Iowa, Sanders is massively overperforming among younger voters. Of the 50,000 Latino voters that LULAC identified, Henry says 60 percent are under 35 years old. And Henry's observation is that younger Latinos in Iowa are drawn to Sanders' economic message while older Latinos, who have been familiar with Clinton for decades, remain loyal to her.\n\n\"It's a small population, but it's skewed toward a young population,\" says Henry. The latest census data puts Iowa's Latino population at just 5.6 percent-few states are whiter than Iowa. But the median age of Iowa's Latinos is just 22 years old. Des Moines public schools, says Henry, are 27 percent Latino. LULAC has worked with Des Moines high schools to conduct caucus training in senior government classes so that high school seniors who will be 18 on Election Day in November know how to caucus.\n\n\"We have young people coming of age every year now, turning 18, getting registered to vote,\" Henry says. \"We are reaching a significant point in time where we have enough registered voters where we can participate in the caucuses in a significant way. Never before have we been able to do this.\"\n\nHenry is driven by what he sees as a special moment for political activism among young Hispanics. The most visible incarnation of this activism nationally has come from Dreamers-young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children who are pushing for legal status in state capitals and in Washington. It probably doesn't hurt that Congress's most prominent opponent of pro-immigrant legislation, GOP Rep. Steve King, hails from Iowa. Henry wants to seize this moment and make sure that young Latinos remain engaged politically. \"These young people-I haven't seen this since I was a kid from the 1960s and 1970s, this kind of activism,\" says Henry. He wants to capitalize on this engagement and make it a lifelong habit.\n\nAfter Monday's caucuses, even though the money for Henry's project will run out, he plans to use the voter data and volunteers he organized to mobilize Hispanics in the general election in Iowa-a swing state. And if he is successful in turning out a significant number of Latinos for the caucuses, he hopes his effort will become a template for activating Latino voters in states across the country. But first, he has to get Latinos to caucus-an hours-long, detailed, and even intimidating process in which caucus-goers form groups based on their favorite candidate, advocate for that candidate, and then often regroup before finally allotting delegates from their precinct.\n\nLULAC's caucus training sessions around Iowa, Henry says, begin with the following instructions: \"You're going to be there for two hours, so be prepared. And you've got to be there by 7 because the doors will be locked right at 7 p.m.\" The training stresses the history of the Latino community in Iowa and the importance of each participant in the process. \"You're the change agents, so you need to stay there,\" is the message. Then the trainings, many of them taking place in high schools, go through a mock caucus. If the voters find the procedure easy to understand, the training is over. If they say it was hard, then they do it again.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Convince Latinos Who \"Haven't Felt Seen\" to Vote\n\nVoter engagement event for the Latino community in Greensboro, N.C. Chuck Burton/AP\n\nClaudia Garcia had never watched a televised presidential debate. On September 10, she tuned into ABC News ' showdown between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris and was stunned to hear the Republican nominee repeat lies about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. \"I was like, what?\" Garcia recalls. \"What is he saying? We are not that [as] people. We don't eat dogs. We don't eat cats.\"\n\nAn infrequent voter, Garcia will be going to the polls for only the third time in her life this November. Born in Riverside, California, but having spent most of her childhood in Mexico, she felt disconnected from politics. Her father told her voting did not make a difference. \"If it's not affecting me directly ,\" she thought, \"it's not affecting me.\" But her husband, Salvador, a newly naturalized US citizen born in Mexico, felt otherwise. This year, he will be casting his first vote since pledging the Oath of Allegiance in February. Their two adult children will also be voting.\n\n\"Why would we support someone who sees us as trash?\"\n\n\"I think a lot of these migrant and Hispanic homes,\" Garcia says, \"it's not just they don't want their kids to vote or they don't want to vote themselves. I think we're not informed...There's a lot of education still to do in many of our communities.\"\n\nThe Garcias live in Tulare in California's Central Valley. Latinos account for 60 percent of eligible voters in the 22nd Congressional District. As my colleague Noah Lanard recently reported from the area, Democrats' waning support in the region could determine the balance of power in Congress. In one of the closest House races of this election, Rudy Salas is facing a rematch against Republican incumbent Rep. David Valadao to become the first elected Latino congressman from the Central Valley. In 2022, Valadao, who is of Portuguese descent, beat Salas by three percentage points.\n\nFor Democrats to have a shot at picking up that seat, they need to not only hold on to Latino voters, but also hope for an end to-as one political strategist put it to NBC News -\" anemically low\" turnout. In the midterms, the 22nd Congressional District had the third lowest voter turnout of the House districts across the country. To do so, they could use the help of people like the Garcias: Latino voters who have not traditionally voted, or even first-time voters. In California and beyond, the path to controlling Congress and securing the White House may hinge on it.\n\nThe main issues on their mind? The cost of living and immigration. \"I was an immigrant myself,\" Salvador, who gained legal status as a result of Ronald Reagan's amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the 1980s, says, \"and I want more for the immigrant workers of this country.\" He and his wife oppose Trump's plans to mass deport millions of people from the United States and fear that more family separations are on the horizon if he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nThey also hope comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's racist remarks about Latinos at a recent Trump rally where he called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" can persuade voters to go for Democrats. \"In his mind,\" Garcia says of Trump, \"we don't matter. If you don't look like him, then you're you're not worth it for him...Why would we support someone who sees us as trash?\"\n\nImmigration isn't the single, or even the most, salient issue for Latino voters nationwide. But it intersects with broader concerns Latino communities have about the economy, jobs, and housing. In the battleground state of North Carolina, a pre-election poll by the civil rights and advocacy organization UnidosUS found that pocketbook issues rank as high priority for the state's Latino voters. (Many also favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.) There are about 300,000 registered Latino voters in North Carolina.\n\nNumbers showed that 19 percent of the more than 100,000 Latinos who had already voted in North Carolina were first-time voters and 39 percent were infrequent voters.\n\nThe daughter of two Mexican immigrants, Irene Godinez started Poder NC Action in 2020 to foster civic participation among the growing US-born Latino youth population in the state. That year, the organization sent out thousands of political mailers featuring the face of iconic Puerto Rican astrologer Walter Mercado as a strategy of tapping into culture to mobilize young people. In that election-which Trump carried by fewer than 75,o00 votes-first-time Latino voters comprised a large share of total voter turnout in North Carolina.\n\nThis year, Poder NC Action released a multi-part telenovela called \"Alexia the Voter,\" inspired by the Netflix show Jane the Virgin , to encourage young North Carolinians to vote. They have also hosted voter engagement events where people can learn about who's on the ballot while getting their nails or hair done. \"Our ultimate goal is to build independent political power,\" Godinez, who served as Latino outreach director in North Carolina for Hillary Clinton's campaign, says, \"But while we do that, we are building a political home for progressive Latinos in the state.\"\n\nPrior to Election Day, she says, numbers showed that 19 percent of the more than 100,000 Latinos who had already voted in North Carolina were first-time voters and 39 percent were infrequent voters. \"These are exactly the people that we've been targeting and activating because that's where we see the opportunity to expand the electorate.\"\n\nAmong the issues driving that electorate in the state are the economy, reproductive rights, and climate justice, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. The young Latino voters Poder NC Action courts also tend to bring up the war in Gaza as a point of concern . (The organization didn't endorse President Joe Biden, but released a \"defensive endorsement\" of Kamala Harris because her victory would block a right-wing opponent.)\n\n\"The thing I have been hearing from voters that we've been talking to is how they haven't felt seen by the parties whether they're Democrats or Republicans,\" Godinez says, \"They don't feel that either party is reaching out to them and trying to talk to them.\" She believes the Democratic Party could have done more to appeal to Latinos in North Carolina, including sending bigger surrogate names to the state and crafting political mailers with original messages that weren't just translated to Spanish from English.\n\n\"Even if we are 300,000 voters in the state right now,\" Godinez adds, \"we're going to continue to increase at a faster pace than any other demographic because 50,000 Latinos will age into the electorate every single year. This could have been a really great year for them to lay the foundation of what it could look like to do Latino outreach in a very intentional way.\"\n\nIn California, Garcia attributes her political awakening to her work, first as a canvasser and later as an organizer, with the group Poder Latinx to get people registered and out to vote. \"I cannot be preaching and not doing,\" she says. \"I need to be a voice to those who don't have one.\"\n\nShe says she would like to see immigration reform that would benefit her neighbors and family members who \"work out in the field, picking the food that we have on our table.\" She also thinks of her nephews who are DACA recipients and whose lawful presence and ability to work and study in the country are in jeopardy . \"It hits home,\" Garcia says, adding: \"Immigration is what motivates me and scares me, and that's why I'm going to make sure that my ballot gets in the mail today.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Nine members of Congress were there, including Reps. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), and Gloria Negrete McLeod (D-Calif.), as was former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis . Also in attendance were lobbyists and executives for Fortune 500 companies and big industry trade groups. Lonnie Johnson, a lobbyist for ExxonMobil, sat next to Hinojosa at dinner; Walmart lobbyist Ivan Zapien gave the closing remarks . Exxon, American Gas Association, Darden Restaurants, and Coca-Cola had underwritten the event. That was how, seven weeks into the 113th Congress-as lawmakers began work on immigration reform and a tax code overhaul -powerful corporate lobbyists scored premium access to politicians.\n\nThe dinner was organized by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute , an obscure offshoot of the 27-member, all-Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus . ( Caucuses are factions of lawmakers formed around an issue or ideology, such as the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, and the Tea Party Caucus.) The CHCI, founded in 1978 by a small group of Hispanic lawmakers, says its mission is to \"develop the next generation of Latino leaders\" by underwriting scholarships and fellowship programs for young Latinos, funding college readiness courses for them, and placing them in jobs and internships on Capitol Hill. But like other nonprofits nominally affiliated with congressional caucuses , CHCI sells access to influential lawmakers in exchange for big donations.\n\nBefore Congress passed several waves of ethics rules impacting caucuses and lobbyists, corporations and unions that hire lobbyists could pay for trips, conferences, and other perks for federal lawmakers. Today, nonprofits like CHCI offer lobbyists a way to sidestep those rules, says Craig Holman , a lobbyist with the watchdog group Public Citizen. \"It's a simple dance to evade the ethics rules that apply to members of Congress as well as to caucuses,\" he says. \"Lobbying entities can't give gifts, but they can launder the money through nonprofits and let the nonprofits do the giving.\"\n\nHoused in an ivory-colored brick office building a few blocks north of the US Capitol, the CHCI hosts dozens of events each year. Its public policy conference and awards gala, held during National Hispanic Heritage Month , \"represent the largest and most prestigious gathering of Hispanic leaders in the nation,\" the institute's website boasts . Corporate or union sponsorship packages for CHCI events range from a few thousand dollars to $300,000. The more you give, the more you get to hobnob with CHCI's network of legislators and other Latino leaders.\n\nFor a company wanting to endear itself to the Latino community's political leaders, now is an especially smart time to give. As the nation's Latino population grows, so, too, does the clout of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, described by one expert as \"the vanguard of this growing [Latino] power\" in America. Caucus members, all of whom have roles with CHCI, are cultivating new Latino donors and playing bigger roles in Hispanic outreach within the Democratic Party. Reps. Luis Gutierrez and Xavier Becerra, both members of CHCI's advisory council , are part of the House's Gang of Eight crafting a comprehensive immigration reform bill, and lawmakers in the CHCI are poised to play an important role in the immigration reform debate once legislation is unveiled.\n\nCHCI is just one of a long list of \"institutes\" or \"foundations\" trading on its ties to Congress that pockets corporate and union money and doesn't fully disclose its donors. The International Conservation Caucus Foundation, a secretive charity recently exposed by Mother Jones , hosts lawmakers on all-expenses-paid international junkets. Fortune 500 corporations and private conservation groups fund the ICCF, and, in turn, the ICCF pledges an \"unparalleled opportunity for access\" to the 141 members of Congress' bipartisan International Conservation Caucus. The Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, a nonprofit sponsored by the National Rifle Association and gun and ammo companies, affords gun lobbyists and executives the chance to mingle with lawmakers at wine and cigar tastings, fancy dinners, and shooting contests.\n\nEsther Aguilera, CHCI's president and CEO, says her organization doesn't work on policy issues and is unlike, say, the mighty American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Instead, the CHCI focuses on providing young Latinos with access to colleges and jobs they wouldn't otherwise have, helping as many as 1,600 students and workers . Aguilera does not outright dismiss CHCI critics who decry group's ties to corporate and union lobbyists, but she insists that members of Congress should be applauded for lending their name and time to CHCI's efforts. \"Yes, those critics need to be asking those key questions,\" she says, \"but we shouldn't be penalizing our key leaders for wanting to get involved.\"\n\nAguilera acknowledges that CHCI's corporate funders might have ulterior motives-gaining access to politicians, promoting their brand at CHCI's splashy events. Yet she says she welcomes more donations from the private sector, and adds that criticism should be directed at the philanthropic world for failing to fund Latino causes. \"Thank god for the private sector for supporting this community and other communities,\" she says. \"Certainly, the charitable and philanthropic foundations are pitiful right now.\"\n\nAccess-to lawmakers, corporate leaders, and more-is a central selling point in CHCI's pitch to potential donors. For $1 million, donors get the VIP treatment at CHCI galas, a private dinner with board members, and the opportunity to \"maintain a special relationship with CHCI leaders.\" For $300,000, a company can be the sole host of the institute's annual public policy conference, which includes exclusive access to networking events, 20 invitations to a private reception hosted by CHCI chair Hinojosa, and 20 invitations to a reception hosted by CHCI's board members. For $50,000, a donor can sponsor CHCI's \"Fiesta de Golf\" fundraiser in May and potentially get the chance to tee off with a member of Congress.\n\nCHCI's coffers have steadily grown in recent years, from nearly $950,000 in revenue in 1990 to $7.7 million in 2012. Although CHCI, as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit , does not have to disclose its donors, it lists 54 major \"partners\" on its website without saying how much they donated. A donor list provided to Mother Jones shows that CHCI's top donors in 2011 and 2012 included Walmart, PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Comcast, Toyota, American Petroleum Institute, BP America, Altria, Lockheed Martin, Anheuser-Busch, and Coca-Cola. CHCI also received money from the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of Teachers, and the AFL-CIO.\n\nAlong with eight members of Congress, CHCI's board of directors includes executives and lobbyists representing Walmart, PG&E , Cargill, Facebook, Univision, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, the AFL-CIO, and the lobbying firm Ogilvy Government Relations. The group's advisory council boasts 19 more lawmakers and reps from dozens of corporations and unions.\n\nThe mission of the CHCI may be admirable, but its fundraising tactics raise the same red flags as the other access-peddling nonprofits, says Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center. \"What's part of this transaction is blatant access- and influence-buying, and in a way it is money that particularly the corporate world can use to get in the good graces of people at the Hispanic caucus and others,\" she says. \"It is like an insurance policy, so they can maintain good relationships with a caucus that they might not otherwise have.\"\n\nThe institute and its supporters, in other words, are doing what similar nonprofits have accomplished: turning a public interest mission into an opportunity for influence peddling.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Los Angeles County Shows Why Democrats Lost\n\nVoters cast their ballots during the early voting process at a polling station ahead of the 2024 presidential election in Los Angeles. Qian Weizhong/VCG/AP\n\nTwo weeks after the election, I met Dianela Rosario in Huntington Park, California-an almost entirely Latino city that swung hard to the right this year. A 51-year-old Dominican American shopkeeper, Rosario told me that before this year she had never voted for a Republican presidential candidate. But, in 2024, inflation and the prices of groceries were front of mind. President Joe Biden and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris were not fully responsible for the cost of living crisis, she said, but she still wanted someone new.\n\n\"If she's been vice president and there's been no change, then I wasn't sure she was going to be able to change things as president,\" Rosario, who identifies as Afro-Latina, explained in Spanish about why she had not voted for Harris. \"That's what influenced me the most-that things might stay the same as they are now.\"\n\nEarlier that afternoon, a Guatemalan shopkeeper shared a similar perspective. She told me she missed the lower prices of Trump's first term and that she hoped the incoming president would deport people she saw as causing problems in the area. Unlike Rosario, though, she hadn't been able to cast a vote. \"Soy ilegal,\" the shopkeeper explained of her own immigration status.\n\nIn 2016, stories like these would have been hard to find in cities in Southeast Los Angeles like Huntington Park, where 97 percent of residents are Latino. That year, Trump lost by huge margins. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received 84 percent of votes in the area, compared to only 8 percent for Trump. Sometimes, Trump even came in third; in several precincts, Jill Stein was the runner-up to Clinton.\n\nEight years later, a Mother Jones analysis of precinct-level voting data shows that Democrats have lost more support in Southeast Los Angeles than any other part of Los Angeles County. Democrats' combined margin of victory in nine cities in the area, which are more than 90 percent Latino on average, has declined by nearly 40 percent since 2016. Trump has gone from getting less than 10 percent of votes to nearly 30 percent.\n\nThis is not just a function of Democrats staying home. Trump received more than three times as many votes this year in Southeast Los Angeles than he did during his first presidential run.\n\n\"That's what influenced me the most-that things might stay the same as they are now.\"\n\nWhile the data makes clear that voters in largely working-class Latino areas have moved right, the results do not reveal how individual Latinos who live in more mixed (and often richer) parts of Los Angeles voted. Compared to Southeast Los Angeles, Democrats' have lost less support since 2016 in more middle-class majority-Latino cities, although those cities remain more conservative overall.\n\nStill, a national trend-working-class Asian and Latino voters shifting to Republicans, and upper-class voters choosing Democrats-can be seen in miniature in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe results in Southeast Los Angeles mirror the dramatic drops in Democratic support in heavily Asian and Latino areas across the country, ranging from the border counties of Texas' Rio Grande Valley to the rural towns of California's Central Valley to urban areas of New York and New Jersey. While some of these losses have been offset by gains among affluent college graduates who once voted Republican, it was not enough for Harris to win.\n\nThe voting records analyzed by Mother Jones include results for roughly 170 communities. Since 2016, Democrats' margin of victory has dropped by at least 25 points in about 40 of those places, which is well above the countywide shift of about 17 points during the period. In nearly every single community with that large of a drop, Latinos and Asians comprise a majority of residents. The main exception is Beverly Hills, a famously affluent area with a large Jewish population. (Most of the shift in Beverly Hills happened between 2016 and 2020-meaning that it was not primarily a reaction to how Democrats discussed October 7 and Israel's military campaign in Gaza.)\n\nKarina Macias, the mayor of Huntington Park, said in a phone interview that the shift to the right among her constituents reflected concerns with issues that voters across the country prioritized: price increases, crime, and immigration. Macias noted a significant uptick in the number of families in Huntington Park who rely on food distributions, including among residents who probably would have never considered seeking help in the past.\n\n\"The Democrats had the opportunity to help us. They didn't do it. \"\n\n\"I think a lot of people were looking at their current economic situation, and [were] pissed off about it,\" Macias said. \"Can you blame them? No, right? Especially in a community like Huntington Park, they feel it. They're paying a lot more for things and are not necessarily being paid a lot more. If they work two jobs, maybe somebody in the household needs to go and get another job, right? We have a lot of families here that are doubling up in an apartment, and that's how they get by.\"\n\nThe nearly 40-point shift in Southeast Los Angeles is far different from what has happened in some of the wealthier communities in Los Angeles. In the affluent coastal cities of Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, and Hermosa Beach, Democrats have maintained or slightly improved their margin of victory since 2016.\n\nBut these voters did not necessarily back Democratic candidates all the way down the ballot. In 2020, Los Angeles County voters elected George Gascón, a progressive Cuban-American district attorney defeated his more moderate opponent by seven points. After the win, a backlash began almost immediately. This year, Gascón still managed to secure the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times . But he ended up losing to Nathan Hochman, a comparatively tough-on-crime challenger who became an independent after running as a Republican for California attorney general office in 2022. Hochman won by 20 points-a 27 point swing from 2020.\n\nWealthier cities like Manhattan Beach and Santa Monica moved harder against Gascón than most of the county, despite being the areas where Democrats had some of their best results at the top of the ticket. Santa Monica residents went from supporting Gascón by a nearly 2-to-1 margin in 2020 to backing Hochman. In Manhattan Beach, Gascón lost by about 50 points-nearly 40 points worse than he did there four years ago. It meant that there was an almost 80-point gap in the city between Harris and Gascón, even though both are Democrats.\n\nSome of Democrats' most reliable voters in Los Angeles now seem to be rich people who disdain Trump but also recoil to an unusual degree at the left's approach to criminal justice reform. This new base leaves Democrats in a complicated place as a party that has long thought of itself as fighting for working people.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine a less inflammatory Republican than Trump winning the wealthy back to the GOP. Doing that while keeping most of the party's inroads among working-class voters intact could be challenging-but such cohesion would be a way for the GOP to upend California, and national, politics.\n\nThe Los Angeles data make clear how much Democrats are struggling with Asian voters as well. Those challenges appear to be most severe among working-class Asians. That can be seen by looking at the results in San Marino, a majority-Asian city that is one of the 10 wealthiest communities in the county. It has a median home sale price of $2.3 million and is known for attracting wealthy investors from mainland China. Unusually for a majority Asian city, Democrats have lost no support in San Marino since 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, in Monterey Park, which is also about two-thirds Asian but more middle class compared to San Marino, the Democrats' margin has shrunk by 20 points. Similarly, Rosemead, which includes a significant Vietnamese American population, has shifted about 35 points to the right.\n\nStill, the loss in support has been most intense in working-class Latino communities, despite Trump's rhetoric about immigrants. Macias mentioned a cousin who told her that he was planning to vote for Trump. When Macias reminded him that they have family members who are undocumented , he argued that Trump's promises about mass deportation were just rhetoric. (Macias stressed that despite her cousin's comment there is a \"palpable fear\" among many people in Huntington Park about what Trump might do.)\n\nAnother dynamic is a belief among some Latino voters that Venezuelans, who crossed the border in record numbers in recent years, and other people arriving today are different from them and their ancestors. Gustavo Arellano, a Los Angeles Times writer who covered the recent political history of Southeast Los Angeles earlier this year, told me before the election about how his cousins objected to \"these new immigrants\" and were turning Venezuelans into scapegoats.\n\n\"Venezuelans they get free everything,\" Arellano said, paraphrasing his cousins. \"Our parents, when they came here illegally, didn't get anything at all . They did it on their own.\" Arellano tells his relatives that \"these immigrants are just like our parents\" but they insist otherwise. Macias didn't hear this perspective too often, but did recall someone saying about recent arrivals: \"They're demanding things, and we work for them.\"\n\nIt also doesn't help that Democrats-largely as a result of Republican opposition-have been unable to deliver on their promises to provide legal status to family members of some of the voters now turning against them. An undocumented Salvadoran immigrant named Sam made that clear when we spoke in Huntington Park-even though he was one of the strongest Kamala Harris supporters I interviewed.\n\n\"The Democrats had the opportunity to help us,\" Sam explained in Spanish. \"They didn't do it. As a result, all the Hispanics that are scattered throughout the United States, who are now citizens, who can now vote, are making them pay.\"\n\nHis partner argued that Americans aren't prepared for the world Republicans are vowing to bring into being through mass deportation : \"It's laughable that if you go around Bakersfield, or around where the crops are, there are no Americans there. There's none of that there. I don't think that a person like you, who is a professional who works, let's say, at a different level, is going to go there and pick strawberries. And those strawberries don't pick themselves. So what's going to happen?\"\n\nLike most people in Southeast Los Angeles, Sam still favored the Democrats. And the voters who abandoned the party aren't necessarily lost, either.\n\nRosario, the Dominican shopkeeper, said she considered herself an independent, even though she'd recently voted for Trump. I asked her if she might have voted Democrat if another candidate had been on the ballot. It was possible, she said.\n\nAt the start of the campaign, she had leaned Democrat because that was the party she had always supported. But Biden \"didn't seem well\" so she switched to Trump. After Harris got into the race, she stayed with Trump because Harris was part of the current administration.\n\nIt was more about the candidate than the party as a whole. \"I think that if Obama's wife had been running, I would have voted Democrat,\" Rosario explained. \"I like her a lot.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Are Some Latinos Drifting to the Right?\n\nJoel Martinez/The Monitor/AP\n\nOn January 6, Gabriel Garcia -a first-generation Cuban American and former member of the Proud Boys- livestreamed his attempt to breach the Capitol. \"How does it feel being a traitor to the country?\" he screamed at police officers as he entered the building. Once inside the Rotunda, Garcia yelled , \"Nancy, come out and play!\" as insurrections searched for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nGarcia was subsequently found guilty of two felony charges related to his actions that day. But a year later, he seemed unrepentant: In fact, Garcia joined a press conference in Miami to commemorate the anniversary of the insurrection.\n\nHe wasn't the only Latino there. As journalist Paola Ramos documents in her new book , Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America , the occasion drew members of the \"parental rights\" group Moms for Liberty and the Proud Boys, and many Latinos. \"If we don't agree with the left, or the media's bias,\" Garcia said at the press conference, \"we get called 'white supremacists' or 'racists.' There's nothing racist about a guy called Gabriel Garcia.\"\n\nIn Defectors , Ramos, a contributor for Telemundo News and MSNBC, investigates the \"quiet radicalization of Latinos [that] is taking place across the nation in plain sight\" and the factors behind the pull. Dispelling common stereotypes of Latinos in the United States as a unified bloc of voters allegiant to the Democratic Party and progressive values, Ramos writes that \"to understand our history, which tells us that Latinos can carry white supremacist tendencies-whether they're racially coded as white or not-is to understand that Latinos can easily act as the majority we are supposed to reject.\"\n\nI spoke with Ramos about how cultural assimilation can lead to nativism, the deep-seated anti-immigrant sentiment among some Latinos, and the shortcomings of dismissing a small but growing segment of that population as an anomaly.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clairty.\n\nIn the book, you write that \"mythologies about Latino identity ignore the very real political and cultural changes brought about by the MAGA movement's efforts.\" Why is it an oversimplification to attribute Republicans' and Trump's inroads with Latinos in recent elections to just a \"rightward shift\" from 2016 to 2020?\n\nI think the whole point of the book is that I try and force people to understand the story beneath the numbers, which is, to me, this idea that there are larger cultural, historical, and psychological forces that are driving a small-but I believe a growing number-of Latinos towards extremism and Trumpism. When you zoom into that, you see that there is this racial baggage, colonial mindset, and political traumas that we carry with us. I think what we're seeing now is the way in which Trumpism is revealing those elements.\n\nWhat are the main influences you identified as driving a small but significant number of Latinos to the right?\n\nI structured the book in three ways: tribalism, traditionalism, and trauma. Tribalism I refer to as internalized racism. Our story is also part of the story of having been colonized. With that came a caste system, colorism. What I refer to as traditionalism is the way in which colonization enforces patriarchal and binary norms. What does that mean in today's culture wars? What does that mean in today's debates around Christianity and Christian nationalism? And then what I refer to as trauma is understanding the very complicated relationship that we have with communism , but the way also that we've had very complicated relationships with strongmen rule and authoritarianism and the history of the United States' involvement in Latin America . All of those 'T's'' manifest in very complicated ways in American politics. I think the easy story is to mark us off as this liberal, progressive, united bloc. But it's actually a messy story, particularly when you understand the darker parts of our history.\n\nHow has the United States' legacy of spreading American exceptionalism in Latin America impacted the country's own ongoing \"battle with democracy\"?\n\nThe way that in this country defeating communism became synonymous with patriotism, with the ultimate definition of what it means to be an American...\n\nFrom the way that we've been involved in Cuba, Nicaragua, Chile, El Salvador , where there were these very concerted efforts to overthrow, in some more violent and other more subtle ways, elements of socialism. Now what we see is not only a diaspora of Latinos that flee from those countries, but also a United States government that reinforces the idea of Democrats being synonymous with communism, which is part of the Trumpism strategy. There's this tendency to go back to those wounds that are very familiar to Latinos. You're fleeing communism? Well, communism can also happen in the United States. This idea that when democracy feels somewhat messy in the United States, then you resort to the strongman rule.\n\nI do think the majority of people that I've interviewed do actually have very traumatic experiences with the past. I don't want to underestimate that. Where the manipulation happens is on the Republican Party side, where they've been able to really master is a way of exploiting that trauma through the spread of mis- and disinformation wars. They've also found a way to exploit that racial tension by creating this idea that there's a crisis at the border, or fearmongering criminal talk.\n\nThe first chapter of your book focuses on anti-immigrant sentiment among some Latinos in the United States, including a first-generation Mexican immigrant turned border vigilante, Anthony Aguero, who sees recent migrants as people who are vastly different from him-even a threat. A recent Axios poll shows an increase in the percentage of Latinos who say they support building a border wall and ramping up deportations. What did you learn from your reporting about what leads some Latinos to embrace nativism?\n\nThere's a blurry line. We can be minorities, but we too can perpetuate racism. Latinos, particularly the more generations are in this country, are not immune to nativism. The more we assimilate, the more we conform to American principles and the idea of \"otherizing\" is a real force, whether you're Latino or whether you're white. That's why something like the great replacement theory is so forceful and is so potent. The dynamic of nativism at its core is this idea that culture is being threatened by the \"other.\" A lot of Latinos, no matter how American you are, have to work twice as hard to prove belonging. You're third or fourth-generation Latino, but there are always these sentiments of not belonging or being \"otherized\" by fellow Americans and there's this constant wrestling with the idea of having to prove yourself.\n\nFor a small group of Latinos, that journey can become very painful to the point that you can end up with some Latinos like Anthony Aguero who become fervent anti-immigrant vigilantes along the border because they're pulled by those two notions of proving that they belong and proving that they are not like the \"others.\" It's very easy to become radicalized just to prove that you are not them .\n\nAnti-immigrant sentiment is so powerful, pervasive, and infectious that even newly arrived immigrants can sort of lean into that.\n\nDo you think extreme anti-immigrant policies-like SB 4 in Texas, which in some ways is reminiscent of SB 1070, the \" show me your papers \" measure in Arizona, and Proposition 187, which denies undocumented immigrants access to public benefits in California-can lead to backlash and reverse this trend?\n\nThis book is about a small but growing segment of Latinos. I do still think that the majority of Latinos are still more united.\n\nI think what's interesting about this moment is that I see it as a cultural reckoning. Is this the election where you have some Latinos continuing the numbers of 2020? And if that is the case, then perhaps parts of the white vote and the Latino vote are a lot more similar than not, and part of what's driving that similarity is the issue of immigration.\n\nBut I still believe that the majority of Latinos are united by this solidarity as having immigrant roots. I think of the way that Arizona turned blue because of the trauma that so many of those immigrant children experienced as they were seeing their parents being deported by Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio. I still do believe that is at the core of what will drive the majority of Latinos this November-this idea that in the face of someone like Donald Trump, Latinos have more in common against that image than not.\n\nWe're in an interesting moment where there's still a little bit of distance between the border and some Latinos, between Donald Trump and some Latinos-but the moment that it starts to creep into their own reality where potentially someone can knock at your door and racially profile you no matter how long you've been in this country, then perhaps we'll start to see a shift.\n\nYou argue that the Democratic Party has failed to see Latinos in their totality. What should Democrats do differently in 2024?\n\nI do think that the Democratic Party, at least this time, is mobilizing earlier. They're doing outreach a lot earlier than they have in previous years, they're paying a lot of attention to Spanish-language media.\n\nI always go back to: don't dismiss the small shifts, the surveys, and the polls so quickly. Don't dismiss these rightward shifts as anomalies or outliers. Because that means truly dismissing Latinos, once again, as really complex humans that carry a lot of complicated history, pasts, and traumas into this country. It goes back to this idea that Latinos are a monolith. Dismissing it can lead to results like we saw in 2020 when Trump did over 10 points better than he did in 2016.\n\nI hope that we can start to break that apart and have hard conversations about what it means to be an extremely complex, misunderstood community in this country.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Latinos Are Super Green. When Will Environmental Groups Realize?\n\nJeff Malet/Newscom/Zuma Press\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nAdelina walked briskly everywhere-and never more so than on her daily errands to the open-air mercado near my aunt's house in Mexico City. My 8-year-old self would try to keep up, braids flying, as I watched our housekeeper's shopping bags swing on her sturdy shoulders in a kaleidoscope of bright hues. Earlier this year, when a plastic bag ban took effect in Mexico City, news outlets noted a comeback of the traditional reusable bags Adelina once carried, which are made of plastic fiber or ixtle fiber from the maguey plant.\n\nBut bags like Adelina's have always been popular in Mexico's traditional mercados. Some of my favorite childhood memories are of those daily visits to the market during family stays in my parents' native Mexico City. We'd pile those bolsas de mercado with everything from chiles, squash, and tomatoes to freshly-plucked chickens, which dangled from hooks above the food stall counters. Then we'd head to the tortillería to pile our bags with stacks of hot, freshly-made corn tortillas.\n\nAs a California-born kid who grew up in the 1980s when plastic bags were growing ever more ubiquitous , these bolsas de mercado left an impression. Being green was as easy as walking to the market. Doing it with flair in big, bold colors a la Mexicana made it fun. Today, the bags may be enjoying a comeback, but the fact that this custom survived the onslaught of throwaway plastic bags is also a powerful symbol of a cross-border culture that's rooted in conservation. Latinos don't get much credit for being environmentalists, but green organizations in the U.S. would be wise to tap this community as a natural constituency.\n\nMexicans, like other Latin American cultures, have a rich, indigenous heritage as natural caretakers of the environment. The Aztecs were essentially a zero-waste society , growing food on floating artificial islands known as chinampas on the lakes in the valley of Mexico, where the capital is now located. Today in the U.S., Latinos conserve not only out of economic prudence, but also because so many low-income Latino households live in frontline communities where they cope firsthand with the effects of pollution and contamination.\n\n\"In the United States too often we think that 'environmentalist' means the person who is driving in that electric vehicle, when in fact we neglect the 20 people who are riding in the bus,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra-the first Latino to hold his position-said during a speech at the 2018 Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. \"Hard-working people around the globe, people of modest means like my parents, are some of the best conservationists in the world because they can't afford not to be.\"\n\nBecerra grew up in a working-class Sacramento household where his parents, Mexican immigrants, taught him frugality as a way of life.\"Hard-working people are the ones telling their kids, 'Apaga la luz! Turn off that light when you leave that room!'\" Becerra continued at the summit. \"They're the ones that say, 'Clean up that plate. Don't serve yourself more than you can eat. It's too precious.'\"\n\nIn an interview with Grist , Becerra recalled that many of the conservation lessons he learned during his childhood were driven by economic need. His family couldn't afford to stay in hotels when they visited relatives in Guadalajara, so his parents invested in a camper shell for the family pick-up truck, which doubled as a place to sleep and eat for the family of six. Becerra learned to cook on a tiny portable stove, create as little garbage as possible, and identify yerba buena (mint) and té de limón (lemongrass) plants, which Mexicans use to cure stomach aches and other ailments. \"At the end of the day, you find that out of necessity you become really good stewards of the land,\" said Becerra.\n\nThis thriftiness of working-class families translates into energy-saving behavior: In the United States, low-income households generally use about one-fifth the energy of their wealthier counterparts, Becerra pointed out. And in California, where almost 40 percent of the population is Latino, the average carbon footprint is nearly 50 percent less than the average American's. In Becerra's view, California's diverse working class represents \"our best environmentalists.\"\n\nYet despite having a smaller carbon footprint, these communities don't enjoy the full benefits of their energy-saving practices-in part because they often live near industrial facilities, heavily-trafficked corridors, or contaminated Superfund sites. Latinos and African Americans across California disproportionately live in communities overburdened by pollution . More than 18 percent of the state's Latinos and 17 percent of African Americans live in one of the top 10 percent most pollution-burdened communities, compared to less than 3 percent of white state residents.\n\nThose disparities spurred Becerra to create a state bureau of environmental justice within the attorney general's office almost two years ago. The bureau works to protect vulnerable communities from environmental ills through investigations, oversight, and the enforcement of existing environmental laws. Among other measures, it has supported an Oakland ordinance prohibiting the storage and handling of coal and petroleum coke at a rail and marine terminal in the city.\n\nEven beyond the bureau, environmental work has been one of Becerra's priorities as attorney general. Since 2017, his office has won 20 environmental lawsuits against the federal government. The California Department of Justice has challenged the Trump administration on a range of issues: It has opposed proposed offshore drilling on California's coast and challenged the repeal of regulations governing hydraulic fracking of oil and gas wells drilled on federal and tribal lands.\n\nLatinos typically don't self-identify as environmentalists, but surveys show that they consider themselves to be stewards of the environment. Mark Magaña, president and CEO of the nonprofit GreenLatinos and a 2017 member of the Grist 50 , has found that while most Latinos may not be active in green organizations, they are what he describes as \"cultural environmentalists.\" That is, in their day-to-day lives they tap into the cultural traditions of their ancestors-the ingrained conservation practices of their mothers, aunts, uncles, and grandparents.\n\n\"We learned environmentalism on the back of a chancla,\" said Magaña, referring to the whack of the sandal some Latinos use to discipline their children. \"You close the fridge. You eat all your food. You don't waste. You don't turn on the heat, you put on a sweater. You don't turn on the AC, you put a wet rag around your neck. You share what you have. These were things that became second nature.\"\n\nWhen Magaña was growing up in Los Alamitos in California's Orange County, his grandmother would give him birthday cards with a dollar bill attached with recycled Scotch tape, which she had carefully peeled off of discarded Christmas wrapping paper. Today, as he travels across the country, Magaña says that these everyday examples of conservation inspire \"aha!\" moments in other Latinos.\n\n\"I just try to emphasize that you're part of this, you're already there,\" said Magaña. \"You're already a steward of the environment, a conservationist.\"\n\nIn small and large ways, we're protecting the earth with our cultural practices. They're also common sense. Every grown Mexican son or daughter knows the drill: You do not leave your mom's house until she's packed you a mountain of leftovers culled from her fridge. And like a typical Mexican mom she loads up the food in handy to-go containers-in my mom's case, giant plastic cottage cheese tubs or tiny yogurt cups that she has stacked away and will reuse for eternity.\n\nGrowing up in Anaheim, California Congresswoman Linda Sánchez remembers the many small ways that her family practiced conservation. Forgoing store-bought clothes, Sánchez's mother would hand-sew outfits for her young children from a single piece of cloth. Sánchez and her siblings repurposed paper grocery bags as book covers and paper for homework assignments, and they reused mason jars as drinking glasses. The future congresswoman also learned to conserve every possible drop of water from the shower, placing a bucket under the faucet while she waited for the water to get hot. She then used the bucket to water her plants-a habit that came in handy during the drought California experienced this past decade.\n\nThese kinds of practices were also instilled in California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. Growing up in the Pacoima neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, Padilla told Grist that recycling and reusing were integrated into his family's life out of economic necessity. Padilla and his father, a short order cook originally from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, would comb their neighborhood in the family truck to collect cans, cardboard, and newspapers to recycle and help the family make ends meet. His mother, a house cleaner, would receive clothing hand-me-downs from one family whose children were about the same age as Padilla and his siblings. His grandmother used reusable mesh shopping bags, and in Pacoima some of those same bags were ingeniously converted into portable grocery carts with wheels, recalled Padilla.\n\nRecycling was a way of surviving, whether it was reusing newspapers to wrap and carry eggs home from the market, or converting store-bought Doña Maria mole sauce jars into drinking glasses-a practice Padilla said he recognizes instantly in other people's homes.\n\n\"In many ways, it's a question of economics, being as efficient with our resources as possible: natural resources, financial resources, and otherwise,\" said Padilla.\n\nBeyond the economic motivations, however, Padilla was also taught by his elders to treat the planet as a treasured resource. During family trips to the beach, as Padilla and his cousins would pack up their towels and belongings to head home, his uncle would remind the kids to pick up the trash around them. They'd protest, pointing out that it wasn't their waste. \"That doesn't matter,\" Padilla recalled his uncle telling them. \"You always leave the place better than you found it.\"\n\nPadilla shared that anecdote while lobbying for votes during the campaign to ban plastic bags in California in 2016. \"It's a simple story, but it's very profound and taught our generation to leave this earth better than we found it,\" he said.\n\nAt the national level, Mark Magaña aims to transform GreenLatinos into an activist organization that works beyond the halls of Congress and partners with local Latino activists who can fight climate change in towns and cities across the country. \"In order to overcome the climate crisis, it's not going to be a straight-up legislative battle or a straight-up regulatory battle,\" said Magaña. \"It's going to demand on-the-ground, day-and-night activism in order to convince the corporatists-Democrats and Republicans-that we have to change our economic system, that we have to change our consumption, that we have to change our equity and our justice system.\"\n\nIn Puerto Rico, GreenLatinos worked with residents and activists in 2016 to convince the regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency to commit to closing down several toxic landfills that were not in compliance with local and federal groundwater regulations. More broadly, the organization is working to create chapters and hubs for this kind of work across the U.S.\n\nAs they do so, Magaña said that they are keeping in mind that Latinos approach their environmental stewardship with a mentality that prioritizes community and family. For example, GreenLatinos launched a clean air project with Moms Clean Air Force, a community of parents against air pollution, and named it Ecomadres-a play on the Spanish term comadres, which translates to something like \"close friends\" or \"dear friends,\" as well as madre, the Spanish word for \"mother.\" The term functions both as a nod to the women and mothers who are pillars in Latino communities, as well as the close kinship between comadres who depend on each other, work together, and unite to be a stronger force, said Magaña. Ultimately, for GreenLatinos this effort is about reminding Latinos who are joining the environmental movement that they are not alone. It's about saying: \"There are a lot of other people who are concerned about this who will fight with me, and we'll do it in a way that our ancestors did it,\" said Magaña.\n\nHistory shows that Mexico's ancient Aztec civilization was able to develop \"a resource-efficient culture\" with waste management practices that put everything to use, as author and global waste expert Martin Medina outlined in a 2014 essay . All organic waste-from food leftovers to agricultural residue to human excrement-fertilized the chinampas' crops. The excrement, which was also used for tanning leather, was collected from a network of public latrines and sold at the city's main market. The Aztec world was a law-and-order society with strict rules that prohibited waste dumping and littering during the reign of Moctezuma II in the early 1500s-even sentencing a person to death if they chopped down a tree without authorization. Medina writes that no records have been found of Aztec garbage dumps: \"Instead they developed a system that is similar to a sustainable materials management system , considered today as the most desirable way to manage solid wastes, conserve resources and protect the environment.\"\n\nWhile the Aztec's systematic approach to waste disappeared after the Spanish conquest, today that eco-spirit is very much alive on both sides of the border. I've seen it in Tijuana, Baja California, where I reported on hillside shantytowns that recycle discarded American garage doors and use them to build homes, churches, and stores. I see it among California's farm workers, who rise long before the sun to gather four or more coworkers in a carpool to the orchards and fields where they pick our fruits and vegetables. And I see it in the Adelinas of today, who head to market with their bolsas de mercado, doing their tiny part to protect the earth from more throwaway plastics.\n\nThe polls tell us that 73 percent of California Latinos are in favor of legislators' more ambitious goals to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Seventy percent say that global warming is a very serious threat to our economy and quality of life. (62 percent of African Americans, 60 percent of Asian Americans, and 48 percent of whites in the state say the same.) Among U.S. Latinos, green organizations have a community of natural allies who are receptive to tackling climate change, plastic pollution, conservation issues and much more. In fact, they've got it in the bag.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Census will offer Hispanic or Latino and Middle Eastern or North African as race categories for the first time\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nFor the first time, Hispanic or Latino is listed as one race/ethnicity category and people of Middle Eastern or North African descent will have their own checkbox under new race and ethnicity standards adopted by the Biden administration.\n\nUp to now, Hispanics had a two-part question for their identity: They were asked whether they were Hispanic or Latino and then asked to pick a race of white, Black, American Indian or some other race.\n\nThe change now uses one question for race and ethnicity and allows people to check as many as apply to their identity.  Each category has subcategories with examples that may apply and room for those that may not be listed.\n\nThe addition of a Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA, identifier would allow 7 million to 8 million people to no longer have to identify as \"white\" or \"other\" on the census and other forms in which such data is collected.\n\nThe changes are only the second update by the federal government to categories for data about the American population. The update - the last was in 1997 - of standards used by the federal government for the census and other agencies is meant to better capture the expanding multicultural identity of the country.\n\n\"These updated standards are going to help us create more useful, accurate and up-to-date federal data on race and ethnicity,\" said an official with the Office of Management and Budget , who spoke to reporters Tuesday on the condition that the person not be identified.\n\n\"And these revisions will enhance our ability to compare information and data across federal agencies and also understand again how our federal programs are serving a diverse America,\" the official said.\n\nThe changes were effective Thursday, and agencies have 18 months to devise plans for complying and then up to five years to put those plans in place, though some are likely to do so sooner, the OMB said.\n\nThe newest standards reflect results from the 2020 census that showed that most Hispanics did not identify their race as white, Black or Asian and instead were more likely to choose \"some other race\" on the decennial survey or to check \"two or more races.\"\n\nResearch showed that the two-part question is confusing and that since 1980, nonresponse to the race question has increased, the OMB said in an explanation of its recommendations. On the 2020 census, 4 in 10 Hispanics, or 42%, marked \"some other race. A third selected two or more racial groups, and 20% chose white as their race, according to a Pew Research Center analysis .\n\nThe two new categories will have subcategories; the ones listed for Hispanic or Latino are \"Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran, Cuban, Dominican, Guatemalan and other Central or South American or Spanish culture or origin.\"\n\nArturo Vargas, chief executive officer of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, praised the revised standards, calling them \"long overdue and critical step toward ensuring our nation collects the most complete and accurate data possible on the Latino community.\"\n\nBut he also expressed concern that \"OMB is being very prescriptive in how to ask the question\" about race by designating subcategories and \"not allowing for flexibility to reflect new research and improve questions in the short term.\"\n\nHe said there is a need to signal to Latinos who may, for example, identify as Black or African that they should mark that box, as well.\n\nFor the Middle Eastern or North African category, the subcategories are listed as \"Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi, Israeli etc.\"\n\nLabels considered derogatory and racist, such as \"Negro\" and \"Far East,\" were eliminated. Asian is now defined as \"individuals with origins in any of the original peoples of Central or East Asia, Southeast Asia or South Asia, including, for example, Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese.\"\n\nBlack or African American now includes people with origins in Africa, including \"for example African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian and Somali.\"\n\nThe new standards also remove the use of \"majority\" and \"minority\" as descriptors of specific groups.\n\nSome in the Afro Latino or Black Latino population had raised concerns that the combined question would dilute their visibility.\n\nAfter the new race categories were announced, the Afro-Latino Coalition said a statement: \"By listing Latino ethnicity as co-equal with racial categories, Latinos are inaccurately portrayed as a population without racial differences, despite all the research showing how Black Latinos are treated differently from other Latinos.\"\n\nThe OMB said its research showed Afro Latino populations estimates were slightly higher with a combined race/ethnicity question that also provides detailed checkboxes and write-in fields. But the working group recommended more research into the issue because about half of Afro Latinos interviewed during research for the update chose only Hispanic or Latino on a combined question, even though they selected the Hispanic or Latino and Black or African American categories when they were recruited for the interviews.\n\nAlthough the standards are intended for federal agencies, the effect goes beyond that realm. Many researchers, local and state governments and nonprofit groups follow the standards, which also shape policy and affect representation in government through redistricting and, in some ways, societal perspectives.\n\nThe revisions were developed by a working group made up of career staff members from 35 agencies, which received more than 20,000 comments after first recommending the changes in January 2023, according to the OMB. The working group held 94 \"listening sessions,\" three virtual town halls and a tribal consultation about its proposed revisions, the agency said.\n\nIn addition, the OMB said it is creating the Interagency Committee on Race and Ethnicity Statistical Standards to continue research, because the process of updating the standards \"showed that racial and ethnic identities, concepts and data needs continue to evolve.\"\n\nAlong with researching and capturing accurate data about Afro Latinos, it will also consider collecting data about descendants of people enslaved in the U.S., among other topics. The OMB said groups consulted on identification of descendants of slaves did not agree on whether or how to collect the information.\n\nThe others race and ethnicity categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and White.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nI am a San Antonio-based national reporter covering politics, immigration, race, demographics, culture, Latin America and major breaking news.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

A hearing is set for April 8.\n\nBlum, president of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, sued the director of the yet-to-be-built American Museum of the National Latino last month. He has alleged the program is unconstitutional because it is \"not equally open to non-Latinos.\" Blum won the legal case that effectively ended affirmative action .\n\nBlum did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe groups said Blum is asking that the equal protection clause, part of the 14th Amendment, be used \"as a bludgeon to deter equal opportunity.\" The equal protection clause, which guarantees \"equal protection under the law,\" has been the basis for court rulings that prohibit discrimination, such as the landmark desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nIn addition, the organizations said Blum fails to understand Latino identity and ignores historical \"under-inclusion\" of Latinos in the American workforce.\n\n\"This lawsuit attacks efforts to remedy racial discrimination and is part of an assault on civil rights progress,\" Katy Youker, director of the Economic Justice Project of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a news release issued Friday.\n\nBlum had said in his lawsuit that in two classes of interns hired in 2022 and 2023, no one had identified as Black, Asian or white and that in those two years, at least 25, or nearly 90%, had identified as Latino. He said no intern identified as non-Latino.\n\nBut in their brief, the Latino and civil rights groups noted that Latinos are racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse.\n\n\"Many are Indigenous, others are of African ancestry, and many are not. Many speak Spanish, and many others don't,\" said Francisca Fajana, director of racial justice strategy at LatinoJustice PRLDEF.\n\nThe groups, citing federal documents, say Latinos are about 5% of the total Smithsonian workforce of over 6,300 employees.\n\n\"What we do know for a fact is that unequal educational opportunities for Latinos endure. The Latino Museum equips students with technical knowledge and skills to enter and succeed in the museum workforce,\" Fajana said.\n\nThe brief was also filed by the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs on behalf of the Afro Latino Forum, ASPIRA National and the Hispanic Federation.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nI am a San Antonio-based national reporter covering politics, immigration, race, demographics, culture, Latin America and major breaking news.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Most of the around 50 attendees were white and weren't appearing to follow along, though they knew enough to sing out \"Amen!\" at the end.\n\nThus began former President Donald Trump 's campaign teaming up with the Republican National Committee and Pennsylvania GOP to open a \"Latino Americans for Trump\" office Wednesday in the town of Reading.\n\n\"We believe in the American Dream and the only way to obtain the American Dream is working hard,\" Luis Fortuño, the former governor of Puerto Rico, told the same crowd. For the smaller group of Spanish speakers present, he followed with remarks that leaned heavily on the theme of \"Necesitamos cambio\" - Spanish for \"We need change.\"\n\nTrump and top Republicans are looking to boost their support among Hispanic voters in a swing state that could well decide the election. Having shuttered many party offices that specialized in minority outreach , they are betting that promises to prioritize entrepreneurship and smaller government can resonate with a voting bloc that historically has favored Democrats.\n\nReading is perhaps best known as the namesake for the Reading Railroad from the Monopoly gameboard. A town of about 95,000 around 65 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Reading is 67% Latino, according to U.S. Census figures, and home to high concentrations of people of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage.\n\nBiden's approval rating has dropped among Hispanic adults in national polls, but it remains unclear if Trump can capitalize.\n\nThe Reading office opening comes a week after Trump's campaign established its first Pennsylvania office at a site in northeast Philadelphia. That event was billed as a \"Blacks for Trump\" gathering and featured Republican Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and other prominent Black Republicans.\n\nBoth in Philadelphia and in Reading on Wednesday, most of the attendees were white.\n\nTrump himself held a rally meant to energize Latino support on Sunday in Las Vegas, where he quipped: \"We need every voter. I don't care about you, I just want your vote.\" The former president also said immigrants were turning the U.S. \"into a dumping ground\" and vowed, \"We're not going to let them destroy our country.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden 's campaign says Trump is dealing in dangerous and racist stereotypes and has dismissed his campaign's office openings as superficial patronizing of minority voters.\n\nBiden's reelection campaign, together with the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, has opened 24 offices and has 100-plus staffers across the state, and has spent months organizing house parties and other voter mobilization efforts. It has been spending on ads in Pennsylvania since late last summer with a special emphasis on voters of Puerto Rican or Caribbean heritage.\n\nYrene Rodriguez, 46, an accountant at Reading Community College who said she and her whole family are Biden supporters, dismissed Wednesday's efforts by Trump's backers as \"just propaganda.\"\n\n\"They just want to get people to say nice things about him,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nLuis Rodriguez, who owns a real estate wholesaling and rehabbing business with offices in Pennsylvania, addressed the Trump office opening and talked about the importance of extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall, a signature promise from Trump's first campaign that he pursued in office.\n\nAsked after the event about concerns Trump's harsh personal rhetoric might alienate some Hispanics, Rodriguez, who isn't related to Yrene, said such suggestions don't have \"any backing or validity.\"\n\nMichael Rivera, a commissioner in Berks County, which encompasses Reading, spoke at the office opening in English and Spanish and said more effort to reach out to Hispanic voters \"demonstrates the Republican Party's understanding of the power of diversity among the American people.\"\n\nLocated in a red-brick building across from a downtown CVS, the campaign office was indistinguishable from most corporate spaces, except for the placards in the front window reading \"Latino Americans for Trump,\" \"Stop Illegal Voting\" and \"Joe Biden, You're Fired.\"\n\nAttracting more attention was a table of Trump merchandise set up for the event on the sidewalk outside. Some people walking by rolled their eyes or voiced their objections, but others were delighted with the display.\n\n\"I only want the true king. The true king of America!\" bellowed one man, loud enough to be heard inside the office. \"That's Trump.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

We are already American. This is our country,\" Florez said. \"We came here to stay, we came here to pursue our American dream, we have our families here, and we have our future in the United States. ... Trump gave us the opportunity to feel more united with the idea of working together to make America great again.\"\n\nFlorez said the campaign plans to hold rallies and launch digital, TV and radio ads in both English and Spanish. But he declined to share more specifics, including who will run the effort or how much money it will spend on outreach, saying that some details will be unveiled at Sunday's rally.\n\nTrump's official Latino outreach campaign is off to a late start, less than five months before Election Day. The Republican Party ha s also closed some of its Latino and minority outreach offices.\n\nThe Biden campaign has touted its earlier outreach to Latino voters since last year. In March, the campaign launched its official \"Latinos con Biden,\" investing in ground operations in key battleground states and holding campaign events with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , as well as placing ads in English, Spanish and Spanglish.\n\nWhen asked why the Trump campaign's Latino outreach is launching now, Florez said Trump's trial had complicated the plans they had and put them on hold.\n\nLast week, Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election; his sentencing will be on July 11.\n\nTrump still faces criminal charges in Georgia, Florida and Washington, D.C., but the trials have been delayed and are unlikely to take place until after the Nov. 5 election.\n\nRegarding the closings of the Republican community outreach centers, Florez said those happened because the leases had ended and the Republican National Committee chairperson cannot sign contracts beyond the limit of their tenure, ( Ronna McDaniel resigned as RNC chair in February, after Trump handpicked a new leader).\n\nDanielle Alvarez, a senior adviser for Trump's campaign, said the campaign has \"hundreds of staff and dozens of offices throughout the country to harness the energy and movement President Trump has created, and ultimately deliver victory in November.\" She said offices and staff in the states are not specific to certain voters because issues like the economy impact everyone.\n\nBiden won 63% of the Latino vote in 2020. Trump, however, made inroads with Latino voters in that race compared to 2016, especially in Texas and Florida. According to an April NBC News poll, Latinos favor Biden over Trump, 49% to 39%.\n\nThe April poll also found low approval ratings for Biden among Latinos (40%), though that was up from 35% in January.\n\nTrump has made gains among Latino and other voters in recent polls.\n\nThe economy has been a top concern for Latinos , and two-thirds of Hispanic people surveyed in NBC News' April poll thought the economy had not improved under Biden.\n\nTrump held an event in the Bronx in New York City last week aimed at reaching out to Hispanic and Black voters.\n\nFlorez said that under Trump, Latinos \"had our great hour, our income was better.\"\n\nBiden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement that Biden has delivered \"real results\" for Latinos, citing lower health care costs , job creation that has resulted in record - low Latino unemployment , and \" historic investments leading to Latino small businesses opening at the fastest rate in a decade.\"\n\nFlorez said part of the appeal for Hispanic people who support Trump is his unscripted style.\n\n\"He says the things that we want to hear,\" said Florez. \"He doesn't speak our language, but he says what he thinks.\"\n\nFlorez referred to Trump's speaking style using an expression in Spanish, \"al pan pan y al vino vino,\" which means Trump says it like it is.\n\nTrump's critics, including the Biden campaign, have slammed some of the former president's recent comments, including floating the possibility of imprisoning his political opponents .\n\n\"The American people and the Latino community deserve a president who's focused on delivering solutions for them and their families instead of a wannabe dictator who's focused on himself and ripping away our basic freedoms,\" Chavez Rodriguez said.\n\nCarmen Sesin is a reporter for NBC News based in Miami, Florida.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

At the same time, vitriolic ads are continually being released that feature racist and demagogic depictions of immigrants, especially Latino ones. And, if you remember, despite Trump's relentless anti-immigrant rhetoric, he won a higher percentage of the Latino vote in 2020 than he did in 2016. With less than 20 days to go until Election Day, immigration policy continues to be front and center as one of the most polarizing issues this year. What is driving the rise in far-right sentiment among Latinos? Paola Ramos is an award-winning journalist and an author. Her latest is titled, \"Defectors: Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America.\" She's also a contributor for MSNBC and Telemundo. She joins WITHpod to discuss forces spearheading Latino support of far-right politics, the effects of radicalization and more.\n\nNote: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos.\n\nPaola Ramos: I do think that the hate is real and it's visceral. I think we need to believe in it. I think from now until the election, the hard work is that, you know, so much of this language has become so abstract. Now we're so used to talking about mass deportations and this language and this insane rhetoric. And I think we need to ground people in what that means again, and sort of visualize it in the same way that we were able to do four years ago with family separation. You know, the same way that the country reacted to the clips of children crying. And I think it was very emotional and people felt it and think we need to do the same thing.\n\nChris Hayes: Hello and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening?\" with me, your host, Chris Hayes. I'm speaking to you and I think it's important that I mark the time because we're in campaign season. I'm speaking to you 20 days from the election. You'll hear this a little afterwards. I'm saying that just in case something insane happens in the next few days, which is always possible. Just to mark that. And on the day I'm talking to you, Donald Trump is doing a town hall with Univision, which is one of the two major Spanish language channels in the U.S. Kamala Harris has already done a Spanish language town hall.\n\nAnd one of the things really interesting, I was just watching it before I came on here, is well, a few things. One, we've seen that, you know, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump among Latinos in both exit polling and as far as we can tell from like the actual returns by an enormous margin. That margin shrank in 2020. Donald Trump made gains among both African-American voters and Latino voters, significantly among Latino voters, specifically and significantly in South Florida and the Rio Grande Valley. And in the polling we see that trend has continued. So it's moving in the same direction.\n\nYou have more and more Latino voters defecting basically from the Democratic Party to Trump. And that shows up across all sorts of polls and in all sorts of cross tabs. I think it's pretty established. Now, it's possible all this is wrong and when the election happens, this is all polling and measurement error. That is a possibility. I want to just stipulate that. We know pretty well from the actual returns that it's not measurement error in say 2020. Like we can look at South Florida and we can look at the Rio Grande Valley and we don't have to deal with polls. Like we know that those are heavily Latino places. We know what their history is. We know they swung.\n\nSo by and large, I think what the data is showing us is Donald Trump and the Donald Trump Republican Party has made significant inroads among Latino voters, also among black voters, although to a lesser degree. And that this has happened despite the fact that, you know, the Trump campaign really is, I think at this point, almost monomaniacally focused on a pretty disgusting message on immigration that, you know, people of all kinds of different perspectives can have different views on how much immigration should come to the U.S. But I think if you watch the visuals and the ads about immigration, they're very frankly racist, bigoted, demagogic attacks on immigrants, lies about them, lies about what they do, and very specifically about Latino immigrants.\n\nYou know, there was an event in Aurora, Colorado the other day with enormous blown up pictures of Latino men who were alleged migrant criminals that, you know, Stephen Miller was sort of directing a two minute hate against. You know, this is, I think, really alarming, gross stuff, but it also seems to be working with large sections of the population, including Latino voters. And I don't think there's that much of a myth. This is less confounding, I think, to me than I think it is to some people, but it has been the source of a lot of consternation, a lot of hand-grinding, a lot of analysis and into this conversation comes a fantastic new book by my colleague, Paula Ramos. She's a contributor for MSNBC and Telemundo, and she's been a reporter for years. And her book is about basically this phenomenon. It's called \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America.\" And Paula, it's great to have you in the program.\n\nPaola Ramos: Thank you, Chris. Excited to be here with you.\n\nChris Hayes: I have a lot of thoughts on this and I really enjoyed your book.\n\nPaola Ramos: I know.\n\nChris Hayes: I want to just start maybe by centering it with your story, like just where you're coming from because I think you have an interesting background, you have an interesting set of identities yourself, you write about them in the book. So you grew up in South Florida and in Spain, is that right?\n\nPaola Ramos: That's right. I was born in Miami to Mexican dad, Cuban mom, but very much in the sort of Cuban-American privileged exile community. So that's just one side of the story. The other side is then when my parents separated, I then spent 15 years in Madrid, right? So then I was sort of ping ponging between Madrid and Miami and with a sort of limited idea of what it means to be Latino in the U.S., right? In Spain, it was this very like Eurocentric identity. In Miami, it's this very sort of Cuban exile-centric identity. And so it's not until I moved to New York City, I step in Barnard College here in the Upper West Side that I really sort of insert myself in a diversity that I think was really hard to see in a place like Miami. And I think Miami makes you believe that, you know, everyone that's Latino is Cuban, that everyone has this very privileged story of immigration, a very direct pathway to citizenship like they do in Miami, only to come to New York and really understand what it means to really be part of that.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, that Miami subculture is interesting because in many ways it was always viewed as sui generis, right? There's for a bunch of reasons. One, sort of through the mechanisms of self-selection, the people fleeing Cuba tended to be the most anti-communist.\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: They particularly in the beginning tended to have the most means. They also had basically a complete part of the U.S. immigration code for them, right? Like they had the easiest time. This is not true anymore. We should be clear. In fact, it's very much not true --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- but for a long time, the easiest time coming over.\n\nPaola Ramos: Of course, yeah. I mean, to be Cuban for decades in the U.S. meant to your point that within a couple of years, you had residency and within a couple of years, you then had a very direct pathway to citizenship. And so even now, as we're watching sort of Donald Trump campaigning in Miami and in South Florida, or even the vice president going to Nevada, the way that immigration sort of resonates with those two communities is deeply different, right. In a place like Nevada, where there's so many mixed-status families, where there's people that when they think about mass deportations, that means something to them. In a place like Miami, it's just not the same. Immigration is in person on the same way. When you have people talking about family separation or the border, it's sort of more distant. And so that sort of explains some of the inroads that someone like Donald Trump is able to make in a place like Miami-Dade County.\n\nChris Hayes: Well, and part of it too, right, is that the Cuban exile community and Cuban Americans have been pretty right-wing for a long time. They've been pretty Republican. So, I mean, when you go back to read about the --\n\nPaola Ramos: The Red Scare.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah. When you read about the '60s, it's like all those folks like all that weirdness of the Bay of Pigs folks and the kind of people floating around Nixon, it's like a wild world.\n\nPaola Ramos: I mean, to this day, I mean, it feels like you're still in the '60s, '70s, right? I mean, literally the word Kamala Harris right now is comunista. The word Obamacare is socialismo. Now there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps saying comrade Kamala, right? Because it's that same Red Scare that has been injected in the atmosphere for decades. It's still very much present. But I think, you know, there was this debate maybe two months ago of whether or not that sort of paranoia about communism was really sticking. And there was a lot of experts from FIU that were saying, you know what, it just doesn't stick anymore. But I think the differences, and you talk about this all the time, is that that paranoia of communism has now become the basis for other conspiracy theories to feed off from. So whether it's the big lie, whether it's the migrant crime wave, whether it's your children are being indoctrinated, that foundation that has been the groundwork for so many years is just fueling all of these other conspiracy theories and that makes it even more complicated in a place like Miami.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, the reason that I think starting with your upbringing in Miami and the Cuban community there is important is that it's just an obvious point, but it's like Latinos can be right-wing, obviously. And when you come out of the U.S. context, it's like there's been right-wing regimes up and down the hemisphere.\n\nPaola Ramos: Exactly.\n\nChris Hayes: And those right-wing regimes were supported by, run by Latinos because it's not like there's like hegemonic left-wing or liberal politics through the Western hemisphere, obviously.\n\nPaola Ramos: Exactly. And like even the idea that the U.S. government also sort of conditioned us to believe that in the name of curing the West from communism in certain instances, sort of strongman rule, right? And these military juntas were necessary.\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: Right? And so I think that's kind of where it gets really complicated, where there's a lot of people trying to make sense of why there aren't more Latinos that see Donald Trump as a really threatening dictator, no? And why they're not really scared about that image. Well, I always say the same thing. We have a very complicated relationship with authoritarianism, particularly because of the way that we've been conditioned to believe that if we see the word communism, you know what? Sometimes the idea of authoritarianism seems kind of appealing.\n\nChris Hayes: Yes, because of the history of the Cold War in South America. And you write about that extensively in the book. Let's talk about how you found your way. So, where did your politics come from, though? So like, how did you develop your own sort of views on this stuff?\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, I mean, look, I was before being crazy enough like you and getting into the world of journalism, like I was in democratic politics for many years. I was in the Obama world and the Obama 2012 re-election campaign, worked for Hillary Clinton. And I think so much of what I was trained to believe and so much of what I believed was based on the idea that, you know, a year like 2024, imagine, and come a Republican candidate like Donald Trump that is promising all these things, that is talking about immigrants and the way that he is, that is promising mass deportations, that if we were ever to sort of step into that scenario as a country, that it would be Latino voters that would sort of drive this country away from that reality. And that is what we were trained to believe in Obama world. And so I think what drove me to write this book is kind of taking a step back and challenging some of those stereotypes and biases that I believed. No, I still do believe that we will continue to see the Democrats overwhelmingly winning Latino voters. Like that is --\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- a hundred percent of what will happen. But I do think that we need to question why we're being fractured.\n\nChris Hayes: Well, and the key point there, right, is that post 2012, when they did the kind of, you know, RNC post mortem on the Romney campaign, there's this whole thing of like, there's this Obama coalition, young multicultural, we're turning these people off and we need to do comprehensive immigration reform, we need to get right with that. That Lindsey Graham was saying that. The Senate tried to pass it. John Boehner never brought it up to a vote in the House.\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: And then Trump comes along as like, how about the opposite? And at first it had the effect you would expect because like Latino voters went way against him in 2016. But now it's like, wait a second, what if using anti-immigrant populism and demagoguery, you could bring Latinos into a multiracial, coalition of people who are worked up about the foreigners coming on our shores.\n\nPaola Ramos: Right, which is a tactic that, to your point, as you were saying, it shouldn't be surprising, right? There's a reason why xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments, like it's not a new political strategy. Like it works for a reason. And I say this all the time, no one's immune to that, right?\n\nChris Hayes: Correct.\n\nPaola Ramos: Just because we're the descendants of immigrants or Latinos does not make us immune to that.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah. Stephen Miller is a descendant of immigrants --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- you know.\n\nPaola Ramos: Exactly, but then even when you think about specifically for Latinos, right, there's scholars that write about this extensively around this idea of the Latino immigrant resentment theory. That this idea that it is immigrants that in a way sort of tarnish or diminish the social value of Latinos.\n\nChris Hayes: Oh, interesting.\n\nPaola Ramos: This fear that as Latinos, sort of mainstream America and white America, if they see us lumped into the world of immigrants, will then discriminate us. So I think there's so many factors going on there that have nothing to do with politics and more to do, I think, with this very complicated sort of racial dynamic that we have as a community.\n\nChris Hayes: That's very interesting because part of the Occam's razor theory I use here, and you trouble this, I think, usefully in the book, so I'm going to say it and then you futz with it.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: But it's basically like, if you go anywhere in the world, okay, like in Pakistan, right, there's been a big backlash against all the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. In fact, they did this crazy thing where they basically like had a mass deportation. If you look at Colombian politics right now, a huge strain in Colombian politics is anger at Venezuelan refugees because --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- as many Venezuelan refugees come to the U.S. there's like a million, you know, order magnitude more in Colombia. And like, if you look at Brexit, people were ticked off about the Lithuanians and the Polish who were living there. Now in all those cases, there's not really a racial issue. Like they're ostensibly, you know, Poles and Brits are white, Venezuelans and Colombians are the same race. But like people do have xenophobia or feelings about strangers, foreigners, that can be detached from the racial categories that we in America create. So in that sense, it's not that surprising, right?\n\nPaola Ramos: It's not, but I think we make a mistake by not talking about race when we talk about Latinos. I think one of the things that is happening is that as a community, even if you ask us, what is your race?\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: How do you identify? We're all going to give you very different answers. And that's because as a community, we collectively haven't really understood the weight that, and this is abstract and people are like, it's too historic, but truly like the weight of colonialism and how that really distorted our own understanding of race. Like, I think we're seeing that being manifested here. If you go to the Bronx, I've talked to many, many Afro-Dominicans that are now sort of in the Trump train that see their blackness built against African-Americans or see their blackness built against Haitians. And so that's all stuff that we're sort of carrying here. So that when Donald Trump says things like, well, Black Lives Matter, like they're criminals, that sort of resonates in very different ways, right?\n\nEven when it comes to sort of the racial dynamics between Venezuelans and Cubans, like the polls also do show, you know, that we discriminate against each other as a community. And of course, the color of your skin has a lot to do with it. And so I do think, obviously, you can't explain everything through that. But I think that's the problem that in politics, we never talk about how complicated that racial dynamic is.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, even when you get into the categorization, right? Like even the U.S. census and the official statistics have this, can't quite get their head around what the category is, right? There's white, non-Hispanic. Like Hispanic is not a race. It's a category that sort of overlays race, right?\n\nPaola Ramos: Totally, but even think about that, right? I think as Hispanics, as Latinos, even the idea of reclassifying race has been something that we can do with a lot more liberty than, of course, like black people in this country, right?\n\nChris Hayes: Oh, 100 percent, yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: Exactly, but that, I believe that does manifest in politics, right? Like even the way that the Spaniards allowed for these permission structures to literally allow like racially mixed individuals to pay the Spanish kingdom a tax to literally change their race, right? Like that is something that happened in Puerto Rico.\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: And so that racial dance that we're accustomed to in Latin America, in the U.S., in this framing of racial binaries, it gets really complicated.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, so what you're saying here is, even if I have the impulse to say, look, you don't need race to explain people having right-wing politics of any background, because people have right-wing politics, and you don't need race to explain xenophobia as a feeling people have distinct from what we call racism, right? Xenophobia towards people that are ostensibly in the same racial category. What you're saying is, yes, but you also can't detach the complexity of race --\n\nPaola Ramos: One hundred percent.\n\nChris Hayes: -- and the hundreds and hundreds of years of colonial and post-colonial obsession with it, the boundaries it creates, its construction and deconstruction from whatever politics we're having here.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, I think race and I think our history with race and with colonialism sort of influences our identity in the United States and that helps explain why Trump's language among certain folks and why Trump's strategies resonate in certain ways, right. And I think even the very intentional image that he's trying to put out there in the country, right, there's a reason why we're talking about Haitian migrants eating pets. Now there's something about that image that really merges immigrants and black people and the image of disgust, which are at the end, these like powerful tools in politics, right?\n\nChris Hayes: Yes.\n\nPaola Ramos: It's fear, it's anger, and it's disgust.\n\nChris Hayes: Disgust, yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: And I think it's thinking about what type of effect that has. And if you're a Latino, again, you're not immune to that for many reasons. Yes, the xenophobia, but I think also the racial dynamics have a lot to do with it.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, that's a great point. The other thing, I was talking about this yesterday in a call, we were just going through an editorial call. It's like, you know, for all this sort of head scratching of like, how could Latinos support this guy who's, we see his rhetoric, which just is so gross to me, obviously. But then if I think about myself, it's like, if you looked at my income, it's pretty high in the bell curve of America. And someone could be like, but Democrats are always railing against the rich. They're always saying they're going to raise taxes on the rich and how the rich are getting not paying their fair share. And it's like, yeah, right, but I just don't identify that way. I don't care. So it's like --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- at a certain level, we also just have different identities that can be front and center and different in how we choose to think of ourselves.\n\nPaola Ramos: Completely. But I think where the delusion lies is in the belief among some Latinos that are now sort of, you know, infatuated by Trumpism, the delusion that they believe that they fit into Trump's America.\n\nChris Hayes: That's the question, right.\n\nPaola Ramos: Or that they will be safe in Trump's America.\n\nChris Hayes: That's the question.\n\nPaola Ramos: Or that they would not be victims of the racial profiling that would happen under Trump's America. And I think that's sort of where we have to do the work to ground us in that.\n\nChris Hayes: So this is where this idea because I was just watching the town hall and like the scariest thing to me is when he or the campaign appear to be attempting to do the following, put together a multiracial coalition of like immigrant haters basically like --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: Or like literally trying to be like, we're going to have a rainbow coalition of bigots, a rainbow coalition of haters --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- a rainbow coalition of people who get really worked up on the train's menace --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- a rainbow coalition of reactionaries. And you can be in our coalition if you're a Bronx Afro-Dominican, you could be in our coalition if you're a sort of white-presenting Cuban from Miami, you could be in our coalition if you're a sixth generation Chicano on the border, or just a black dude in Detroit. Like all of you can join --\n\nPaola Ramos: Exactly.\n\nChris Hayes: -- our rainbow coalition of haters, which is a phrase Adam Serwer wrote. And like, that scares the hell out of me.\n\nPaola Ramos: Well, it's the perfect shield for them, right? I mean, this is what they did with Enrique Tarrio, right --\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- the former chairman of the Proud Boys.\n\nChris Hayes: I was going to, right, go to him, yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: He became the perfect shield, no, that would sort of shield the Proud Boys and white supremacists from being called white supremacists. I mean, when I would talk to them, they would literally be like, well, we're not racist. Like, Enrique Tarrio is our boss, right? Like, there's no way we can be racist. But then what happens, right? And I say this all the time. When Donald Trump loses that election in November 2020, one of the first things that the Proud Boys do once Enrique sort of doesn't deliver in that Trump victory in 2020, they break up with Enrique, no? And they really clarify the idea that, in their own words, that the West was built by white race and white race alone and Enrique, leave us, goodbye. And I think that's the story here, no?\n\nChris Hayes: You don't think it's actually a genuine broad-minded vision of putting together a rainbow coalition of haters?\n\nPaola Ramos: I don't think so. But again, listen.\n\nChris Hayes: Who knows? I mean, I don't think so either, but --\n\nPaola Ramos: I don't think so.\n\nChris Hayes: -- you talk to Enrique Tarrio, and Enrique Tarrio to me is one of the main people I think of when I think of this. Tell us just briefly for folks who don't know who he is and what your conversations with him are like.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, so Enrique Tarrio, we know him as the former chairman of the Proud Boys. I met him for the first time in 2018. Enrique Tarrio is not the first image that comes to mind when you think of the Proud Boys. He's an Afro-Cuban, Afro-Latino and his parents are immigrants from Cuba, Cuban exiles. And so I met Enrique in 2018. And I think that's sort of the beginning of his journey towards being completely radicalized. Now, when I first met Enrique, my impression of him initially was like, all right, here's this like super tough man with his sunglasses and his sort of tattoos. But then what you really understand in conversations with him is that, you know, this is someone that as a black Cuban never really fits in the sort of Cuban exile community of Miami. And he's someone that in his own words was always considered too black to be Republican, too independent to be a Democrat and was sort of this like misfit in that Miami community.\n\nAnd here comes Trump that is then praising him. And then comes Roger Stone and he praises him and Ted Cruz is praising Enrique Tarrio. And so all of a sudden, within months. He finds this power and belonging in the Proud Boys, and he runs with that power, particularly when you have a group of, you know, white supremacists and Proud Boys that are telling you to run with that power. And so I saw this sort of transformation of Enrique really being corrupted by that power. And, you know, now we know where Enrique is, behind bars.\n\nChris Hayes: Yes, I mean, he was convicted on a bunch of different things, including, I think, sedition, right? I mean, I think he was one of the big sedition convictions.\n\nPaola Ramos: That's right. And I think what Enrique, of course, exemplifies is a very extreme version of what we're talking about. But I think he is also the culmination of a lot of things that I try and talk about in the book. You know, this idea of tribalism, which is the us versus them. You know, they talk about this all the time. The idea of traditionalism. And Enrique was obsessed with this notion that, you know, women had a role and that it was men that had to, you know, really take the country back to these traditional roles. He obsessively talked about, you know, trans people. And then the idea of the political trauma, the communism.\n\nOne of the things that Enrique said, which I also found among other Latino insurrectionists in Miami, was that part of the reason why they were driven to the Capitol on January 6th was really this idea of the paranoia of communism taking over. Now they truly believed that Joe Biden would take this country into communism. And I think, again, when you put all those elements together, it radicalized people like him.\n\nChris Hayes: More of our conversation after this quick break.\n\n(ADVERTISEMENT)\n\nChris Hayes: You just mentioned these sort of three themes you talk about in the book, tribalism, traditionalism, and trauma as sort of the three main drivers for this kind of conservative line of politics. Just talk me through that argument more broadly. In Tarrio's case, it's pretty clear, but it seems like you encountered this in a bunch of places.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, I mean, I think, look, I think when we're talking about sort of the, you know, the quote, unquote \"rightward shift,\" it's a small one, but when we're talking about that, I think the tendency is to think about it through politics, or through the MAGA effect or Trump effect. And I think what I find more interesting and telling is that there is something about the sort of history and culture and psychology of what it means to migrate from Latin America to the U.S. And I think those are the things that are harder to pinpoint, you know, and to even sort of get language around it, right. When I talk about tribalism, I'm talking about understanding how the weight of colonialism impacted our own internalized racism in the United States and then how that manifests in American politics.\n\nWhen I talk about traditionalism, same, how the weight of colonialism influences our own moral compass, right? So that when Donald Trump uses transphobic language or anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, there's something about that language that really invokes a moral panic among people, particularly some few Latino men. And then of course, trauma being the political trauma, we always often talk about the trauma of communism, but like we said at the beginning of this conversation, sort of the trauma of our complicated relationship with authoritarianism. So I think, you know, many years in my own reporting, I didn't have language to understand any of this, no? The colorism, the racism, the trauma.\n\nAnd so I think this book, the beauty of it is that, you know, as you know, like you just finished yet another book, like to be able to pause and make sense of everything and have historians and scholars and psychologists help me make sense of it all, like, that's where I really learned a lot.\n\nChris Hayes: I was thinking about the part in trauma because my wife and I went down to South Beach for a weekend, which like we do maybe once or twice a year, which is awesome and whatever, love it --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- just go by the pool and I love Miami. I love the people there. I love the culture there. It does feel appreciably more right-wing than it used to --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes.\n\nChris Hayes: -- which is pretty notable.\n\nPaola Ramos: It is.\n\nChris Hayes: But there was a Cuban woman I was talking to who had recently come over in the last few years. And she just like, we were talking and then she says something about Cuba. I asked her about her family and she just very casually, but with a lot of pathos as, oh, you know, communism is a cancer.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: And it was just sort of like, obviously we know, but there was a lot of trauma in the way she said that her parents are still there, her family struggling, like, oh, you know, communism is cancer. And it just like, it cuts to the bone.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: She said that to me as I was reading your book and I was like, yeah --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- there's a pretty good example of it.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, yeah. And like, that's the Miami I grew up around, right? Like I grew up around uncles and aunts that literally told me that Fidel Castro was the devil knowing that would I ever to read anything about in any form of socialism that like I would go to hell, right? Like that's how deeply ingrained it is. I was able to leave, but going back to the Republican strategy there, like they exploit that trauma, right? There's a reason it works.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, all the comrade Kamala stuff. I mean, it's funny, that also clicked together for me in reading your book. And this is also true, like I interviewed Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who was a congresswoman who lost her reelection in 2020, was running for Senate in Florida. And I did a sort of post-mortem with her about her race. And she was like, look, the socialism stuff really worked. Like Bernie Sanders identifying as a socialist and sort of the rise of DSA and all that stuff, whatever you think about it, anywhere else, I'm just telling you in my district, like that killed us. Like that really hurt.\n\nPaola Ramos: Well, there was a post-mortem analysis by Equis Lab. They did it in November 2020. And they found that 40 percent of Latinos believed that the Democratic Party was inching towards socialism and there were more Latinos that were scared of that than they were Republicans sort of flirting with fascism. And so again, that tells you sort of the gap in obviously the effects of misinformation. But again, all of that just is so much more powerful because of that political trauma.\n\nChris Hayes: Obviously, these trends are complicated and, you know, there's a whole bunch of things for different reasons. There's a few things though that jump out. So you talked about the gender dynamics. Like this is happening much more among men than it is among women, and we're seeing the same thing among black men. Again, it's all polling, but like, to the best that we could tell, this is real. And to me, that's not really rocket science. Like, there's a form of gender traditionalism and male supremacy that Donald Trump embodies, that the people around him push for. You know, every woman around him is, you know, accused to a certain, extremely specific mold about how women should look --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- and how they should present themselves and roles they should have. And so that's appealing to certain men, you know.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, you just laid it out perfectly. I mean, look, I think the gender gap is really widening now. I think particularly with Latino women, what you found in the midterm elections is that the issue of abortion for the first time in years became a top voting issue for the community. We're talking about Latina Catholics and evangelicals --\n\nChris Hayes: Totally.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- and conservative women that are able to humanize the issue for the first time, even if morally they're opposed to it. What you saw is that it really has mobilized the community because it's become a matter of life and death for many people. And I think that sort of survival instinct is really hitting. But then I think you're right with Latino men, yes, right. You know, I think what I'm noticing in conversation is that there's something very discomforting to them. Again, we're talking about a small group of men --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- but there's something that is really discomforting around the way that the country is changing, the gender norms that are changing --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- the sexual norms that are changing, sort of the powerful black women stepping into power. There's something about that evolution of the country that I think Trump, again, is trying to create that image of you don't need that, No, we need to go back to the days --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- when you are in power. And that of course resonates with some people, of course.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, I think it's very powerful. So you got the gender stuff. There's also, you know, and this has been a fascinating aspect of Latin-American politics. There's the religious aspect, which is the broad movement from a hemisphere, again, overgeneralizing that was just overwhelmingly Catholic --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- to one that is increasingly evangelical. And you're seeing that, you know, that has been a defining feature in politics in a whole bunch of Latin American countries, in Brazil particularly. It is one of the main drivers of the politics there, and particularly Bolsonaro's election, the first time. So that's happening here too and it seems like that's also a significant part of what's happening.\n\nPaola Ramos: It's all connected, right? You're right. There's literally been an evangelical boom in Latin America in the last decades. A place like Guatemala now has over 40 percent of the population are evangelicals. You mentioned Brazil. Well, Brazil and El Salvador, over 30 percent of the country are now evangelicals. And so in the last 20 years, a lot of the asylum seekers that were coming to the U.S. were of course carrying a lot of these evangelical beliefs. And now the country, you see that it is, Latinos are the fastest growing group of evangelicals in the country.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, the craziest thing about this is that the great replacement theory, which is that Democrats are importing these people to turn them into voters who will reliably vote for them is just not even born out.\n\nPaola Ramos: That's right.\n\nChris Hayes: I think a lot of these folks are going to like, if they get citizenship, become conservative Republicans.\n\nPaola Ramos: Well, what's interesting is that they may say that, but at the same time, as they're seeing their own levels of white Christian sort of decline, they have understood that they may say all they want to say about, you know, non-citizens voting, and we don't need them. Actually, they need them. They are seeing an opportunity in Latino evangelicals.\n\nChris Hayes: Yes.\n\nPaola Ramos: And they have understood that they need to be organizing in those churches if they want sort of the Christian right to succeed. I think that's what's interesting, the transformation of, you know, so many of these spaces that are spaces of refuge, safe spaces, places where a lot of these first and second generation immigrants have always felt sort of secured. And now all of a sudden and certain churches, you're seeing the way that they're really politicizing it in. I think a lot of 2020, a lot of his inroads had to do with that community. I mean, there's a reason why Donald Trump launches his National Evangelicals for Trump campaign in Miami-Dade County, right? Like he specifically --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- talked to the community, to Latinos, or because they see something there.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, when he did his Bronx rally, he had a very sort of notorious and infamous evangelical --\n\nPaola Ramos: That's true.\n\nChris Hayes: -- figure in the Bronx.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: And even, you know, the Bronx where I'm from, which is an overwhelming Latino burrow, I've seen it over the course of my life there. Like just the transition from the Catholic Church as sort of the main place to evangelical churches in Bronx neighborhoods, you know, popping up, growing, like --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes.\n\nChris Hayes: -- you could see it almost at the physical street level --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- in a place like the Bronx.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, and it's funny because one of the first questions I always have when I'm interviewing people from the community or immigrants, it's, you know, what is the first thing that you do when you come to the U.S.? And typically it's, I find a church, you know, I find my community in the church. And so it's been incredible to see the amount of new evangelical churches that are popping up because they saw the sort of need in the community to find a form of healing or purpose that I think a lot of members are looking for. And then it's just been incredible to see the way that these pastors have really politicized them.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, and I want to also just be very clear that like, you know, people can have a whatever faith tradition --\n\nPaola Ramos: Oh, yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- they have and have whatever politics. Like it's not like, you know, at the individual level, this is determinative. It's just --\n\nPaola Ramos: Of course.\n\nChris Hayes: -- as a broad sociological trend.\n\nPaola Ramos: Absolutely.\n\nChris Hayes: Everyone knows that, but I just want to say it. So those are two things. So the sort of gender gap, the sort of this kind of religious evangelical. And then the other thing that I just love to hear you talk about is that at one level, what we're seeing among black and brown voters, African-American, Latino is that this education polarization, which has happened among white people, people who identify as white, coming for everyone else. So like this sort of degree divide, which is just in the NBC polling is just like craziness.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, and that's true across the board.\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: I mean, we're seeing, yes.\n\nChris Hayes: Right. So I'm just curious if that's been your experience as well in talking to Latinos at like, that same like people that go to four-year schools that, you know, have like their information environment is I think a little different generally. People that subscribe to newspapers or whatever. And again, I'm making these broad sociological generalizations or people without college degrees who do that. There are people with college degrees, but as a broad matter, I wonder like, do you see that education polarization happening?\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, look, and from a surface level, yes, I think that's true across the board. I will say in the research that I focused on, I was mostly focused on these sort of historical trends and less so on that. But yes, there's certain obvious elements that I don't discuss in the book because they're so obvious, right? The economic anxiety that a lot of Latinos are feeling, like that's a big driving factor. There's a reason why --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- you know, that's working across the board. And then of course, the sort of educational gap is another external factor that definitely is also true among Latinos, of course.\n\nChris Hayes: We'll be right back after we take this quick break.\n\n(ADVERTISEMENT)\n\nChris Hayes: Well, you write about this. So, you know, there's a famous book called, \"How the Irish Became White.\" That was sort of a foundational book in what came to be known whiteness studies. And it's sort of about the fact that if you go back and you read the literature in the newspapers of the 1850s and '60s, the Irish are considered racially other, uneducated and uneducatable, possibly incompatible with self-governance in American democracy, all sorts of racist slurs directed at them. And of course, there's a Know Nothing party and all this stuff. And over time, essentially they migrate from being like any other, whose racial identity is like distinct and not white, to being white. And the same happens for Italian-Americans, for Greeks, for all kinds of different groups that come over from Europe. Is something like that happening to Latinos? Is that a process that doesn't function in the same way anymore? How do you think about it?\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of the, you know, and I've been on the road for the last two to three weeks and that question comes up all the time. And as a question mark, because I think what we're all sort of wrestling with is a question of identity. I think there's a big sort of gap between the way that the country sees us collectively as these sort of like brown people of color with immigrant stories and perhaps a perception that a lot of Latinos have of themselves. And I think in conversation, what you're realizing is that there are some people including brown people and white Latinos and Afro-Latinos that are kind of starting to see themselves more under this lens of whiteness. And again, it goes back to history, you know?\n\nThe racial caste system that the Spaniards institutionalized always created a permission structure for all of us Latinos, whether you're Black Latino, Brown Latino, Indigenous, but it created a permission structure for all of us to always draw this direct line to the Spaniards and to the colonizers and to whiteness.\n\nAnd I think in sort of Trump's America, right, where he's really creating this division between the in-group and the out-group. And in this America where it is true that we are now more Americanized and assimilated and speak English, what you are seeing is that there is a surprisingly growing group of Latinos that do see themselves more reflected in that American whiteness. Now, and I think we go back to the same question. It's a matter of perception. We're all sort of seeing each other in very different lenses, but what we do need to understand is what I was saying before, like the racial lens is so complicated among us. Now because I've talked to dark skinned Latinos that consider themselves white or more Spaniard. I've talked to Afro-Latinos that consider themselves black. I've talked to Mexican-Americans at the border that tell me that they're Spaniards. I've talked to Mexican-Americans in California that tell me they're Chicanos.\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: And so there's kind of this like --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- you know, this collective identity crisis of all of us kind of come to terms with one simple question. It is like how do we identify collectively? And like can we even come up with a common answer there? And I don't know.\n\nChris Hayes: Well, let me stay on this for a second. You know, the sort of story of assimilation that you're talking about, like in the Irish-Italian version, at least in the Northeast, right, the way it goes is like, your first or second generation, you live in the city and you're a Democrat, you know, and then you move out to the suburbs where you like become Republican basically --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right.\n\nChris Hayes: -- and become like white. Essentially --\n\nPaola Ramos: Right. Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- this is the migration pattern, right?\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: I'm oversimplifying. But the assimilation question to me is like, how important is the label itself? Like, what does it even mean tangibly? Like, blackness has a very distinct history in America because of slavery distinctly, and because of the way that it was legislated specifically as the focal point of the Republic in many ways, sidestepped and then fundamentally reckoned with. How productive is the label I guess is a weird question.\n\nPaola Ramos: I think that's the question. Look, I think it is productive because I think that there are sort of these common goals and that we're all fighting for collectively, right? I think we're trying to protect ourselves against systems that haven't always, of course, sort of taken Latinos into consideration. And so I think there's a lot of power in this collective identity. And I think the theory was always that we would have these sort of values around social justice that were different from the values that sort of white America wanted to impose on them.\n\nAnd so I think that so much of the sort of progressive theory and democratic theory of change was based on our collective identity, you know, that we would sort of push the country alongside black people and other minorities towards the sort of better version of the United States. And so I think it's important. But then I think what's interesting is that what you're seeing in assimilation or in the third and fourth generation Latinos is actually two very different stories, right?\n\nThere's a sort of part of the story, which is the one that we're talking about, around this idea of more Americanized white Latinos. But then you look at the younger generation of Latinos and some of them that are actually kind of creating this new version of us that is more diverse, that is not scared to lean into their rights, that is sort of not scared to say that they're queer and that they're indigenous and like that.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: They're doing that with a lot more freedom than the older generations, right? And so I think those two things are happening at the same time.\n\nChris Hayes: Right, like basically a more like proudly and self-declared sort of left-wing or progressive or you know, version of that identity.\n\nPaola Ramos: Perhaps young people that saw their parents being told that they had to assimilate --\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- that they had to speak English and they're actually choosing something different --\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- I think where we typically mischaracterize that is that there's a tendency to think of these younger Latino voters as people that are leaving the Democratic Party or becoming independent, but I think they're simply just challenging the party a lot more --\n\nChris Hayes: Right.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- and expecting a lot more.\n\nChris Hayes: They are not moving to the right. The reason they're leaving the party becoming independent is not because they're getting more conservative --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes.\n\nChris Hayes: -- it's actually, right, it's in the other direction.\n\nPaola Ramos: There's other demands, yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: You interviewed a bunch of people and that the story of Raul, I think, who's the border patrol agent, is just a fascinating one, just because what we've been talking about is, in line with the structural changes that we've seen between 2016 and 2020, 2020 to now in the polling, this movement. Again, it's among a relatively small group of people and we're always talking about millions of people who each one is a snowflake and an individual creature with all the, you know, contradictions and complexities that entails. But you talk to a few people, including this guy Raul, who sort of moved in the opposite direction in a really interesting way. And I wonder if you could tell us his story.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, so Raul is from Mexico, but he was a border patrol agent for over 20 years and, you know, found his purpose in the border patrols, found his community. He was a big Trump supporter. He was at the border during Zero Tolerance Policy. What's interesting about Raul is that a couple of years ago, he finds out in a sort of by mistake, but he actually finds out that he was undocumented. And he was like, yeah, plot twist. But so he finds out that he's undocumented. And so I, I focus on him because Raul then kind of emerges with this identity crisis --\n\nChris Hayes: It's so fascinating.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- where he thought that he belonged, was in the border patrol sort of community where he thought that that gave him, you know, the sort of pride and essence of his being was in the border patrol agency, only to then sort of have himself question and come to terms with this idea of like, who am I now as a Latino? Like, who am I as an undocumented person? Who am I as a very person that I was patrolling and sort of criminalizing under Trump for many years? And I think what Raul shows you is almost a lot of the through lines that I find through the book and through many people that I talk to, which is that, you know, when you actually take a second to understand if you really were welcomed in these sort of like groups, no? But when you really take a second to ask yourself, like, was that what power looked like, no? Was I really respected? Oftentimes the answer is no.\n\nAnd so Raul now the former border patrol agent is in this like very beautiful journey and to kind of discover himself. And in that he discovered that he actually isn't just from Mexico, but he's specifically from Coahuila, Mexico, which is a town where there were so many slaved people that fled from Texas and created this incredible black Mexican community and Raul finds out that he's a black Mexican man. And even when he was doing his DNA testing, like he couldn't believe it. So he had to do it a couple of times because he was like, wait a second, am I? And so again, it's like, once you put these sort of systems to a side and these ideals of what power and identity is supposed to look like, and once you kind of imagine that for yourself and you discover it on your own, it can lead you somewhere else. And I don't know if, you know, where he stands now politically, but it certainly isn't where he was 10 years ago.\n\nChris Hayes: That's really fascinating. I mean --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, just that it --\n\nPaola Ramos: You need to have him on your show, Chris.\n\nChris Hayes: That is an incredible plot twist. When I read that, I was like, oh wow, yeah, that is quite something --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- just in terms of like the paperwork and all that.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: I mean, that does get back to sort of these questions about, like right now the mass deportation question, right?\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes.\n\nChris Hayes: I thought \"The Times\" did a really good piece. Yesterday I cited it in the A block of my show of just like, basically you're viewing a bunch of people who are like, it's all B.S. Like he's not going to really do it. And I'm sympathetic to why people feel that way because he is basically the world's most famous liar and he says a lot of things. So sorting through like, you know, he say he wants IVF for everyone --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- covered by insurance. It's like, well, we --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- progressives and people who follow the news, I understand that that's B.S., that's never going to happen. He's not going to do that. He also says he wants to mass deport millions of people. And so other people are like, well, he's not going to do that. So there's always a little bit of the like, choose your own. I think they're serious about it.\n\nPaola Ramos: I do too.\n\nChris Hayes: I think Stephen Miller is very serious about it. I think they've studied the state capacity issues. I think they've actually like put some thought into it. I think they've got a plan.\n\nPaola Ramos: I agree.\n\nChris Hayes: I think they will hit the ground running on day one. I think that afternoon or the next day, you will start to see --\n\nPaola Ramos: I agree.\n\nChris Hayes: -- people in cuffs.\n\nPaola Ramos: Literally, I am getting goosebumps as you say this because I agree. And I had that same question. I was in Arizona a couple of weeks ago talking to organizers there. And the answer that I had was he will try it, no? He may not succeed, but he will try it. And I think as we're talking, there are many groups on the ground in Nevada and in Arizona that are literally having conversations with the community around the idea of going back to the days of Joe Arpaio, putting plans together, the Know Your Rights campaign, what happens if, you know, these policemen are deputized and they start knocking on your doors again. And who will take care of your kid? Who has custody?\n\nSo like these are real conversations that people are having right now. I do think they will try it. I do think that the hate is real and it's visceral. I think we need to believe it. And I think from now until the election, the hard work is that, you know, so much of this language has become so abstract and that we're so used to talking about mass deportations and this language and this insane rhetoric, and I think we need to ground people in what that means again and sort of visualize it in the same way that we were able to do four years ago with family separation. The same way that the country reacted to the clips of children crying. And I think it was very emotional and people felt it. I think we need to do the same thing.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah. There's a few things that I'm really worried about. That's like probably in the top three. I do think one of the things that I'm really wrestling with and having a hard time with right now is that the polling shows that they have the better part of the immigration argument, although that's come closer. I think that the Harris campaign has probably, in a tactically wise way, made some moves towards the center on that. I'm not sure I'd buy the substance of it, but I also understand what they're doing politically, right? But I just got to say, like, my dad was over. We were up late watching football or something. We watched the local New York evening news, okay? And I never watched the local New York evening news, but I was with my dad and he does and we do.\n\nAnd so it's all campaign ads in the commercial breaks. And there's a bunch of contested races around New York. Now these are things like in the Hudson Valley, in Upper Westchester, like far from the city, Long Island, every ad, Democrat and Republican, is about the border.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: And I'm sorry, it's mass hysteria. It's like, there is a genuine policy problem, a genuine one --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- and it's not racist or hysteria to talk about that, which it genuinely is an issue. But the way that it has been covered, talked about on the campaign, it's just frankly mass hysteria. And I'm like, the idea that in New York's 19th district, which is a district I know well in the Hudson Valley, that the border is the number one issue --\n\nPaola Ramos: It's crazy.\n\nChris Hayes: -- is nuts. It's nuts. It's not true. It's crazy that anyone has been led to believe it is.\n\nPaola Ramos: I know. And, I mean, you've done an incredible work and your show of really debunking the migrant crime wave theory and the migrant crime with rhetoric and you've done it time and time again. And so it comes down to that, but you're right. I mean, since Joe Biden won the election, they have been trying to reenact the 2016 moment. And they understood that to do that, the only thing they have left is to weaponize the fear mongering and to weaponize the issue of immigration and to go back to a more powerful, visceral, angrier, disgusting --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: -- version of build the wall and it's send them back.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: And if they can make someone here in New York City from where you and I are talking, if they can make us believe that that existential threat is in our door, then that's success for them.\n\nChris Hayes: But I mean, the crazy thing is like, okay, in New York City, which is a place that saw tens of thousands of asylum seeking migrants come and actually like had to deal with a whole bunch of like genuine policy problem trade-offs, there's a law in New York that requires housing them, there was not enough space, I mean, there were real issues. I've been trying to navigate this for people that I know, but the idea in these other districts. There are real issues, for instance, just housing prices. You could be a Republican running on housing prices against the Democratic --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- incumbent and be like, why the hell can't my kids afford to buy. There's real issues. It's not like there's no real issues, but the idea that this issue is so nuts to me. It's nuts. And I just feel like something has gone terribly wrong that this is the terrain that this campaign is on three weeks from election.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, because at the end of the day, people vote out of fear or out of inspiration. Trumpism doesn't have inspiration so it's just voting out of fear and that's all they have. But to your point, it's more a question for the vice president. And I understand at the national level what they have to do.\n\nChris Hayes: It's hard. It's not easy, yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: I understand. But that's the hard work.\n\nChris Hayes: It is the hard work and I wonder, I think there's ways. I do think, we cover her big border speech down in Arizona and there were parts I really liked, there were parts I didn't love, but again, it's not for me. You know, Barack Obama, like there are ways to talk about this that fight back against this just disgusting dehumanizing. I mean, they're all but calling human beings cockroaches.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes.\n\nChris Hayes: They're a millimeter away from that.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah. And I think it comes back to the basics again, no? Obviously you have, you have the Harris-Walz campaign that has to be more moderate on this at the national level. The question is, will that work with the Arizona voters that delivered that 1 percent victory for Joe Biden, that will be the question. But I think to your point, it's a matter of language, you know, and really instilling in people again that we are talking about human beings. And I think that's where I worry, Chris, about, you know, in the long-term, will it be worth it, no? I remember when you had that conversation, when the vice president was doing the speech in Arizona and Mariano Hossa (ph) --\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: I saw you guys going back and forth and Mariano Hossa (ph) kept being like, well, I wish you would flip the script.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah.\n\nPaola Ramos: And I think there's this larger question among Democrats. Like, you know, I think in the short term, it makes sense to sort of have this tougher stance on immigration. But in the long term, I think there's a question of like, how much are we compromising our values? And in the long term, will it be worth it? And I think it's fair one.\n\nChris Hayes: Well, and I think, you know, to me, again, I basically think that the tactical choices they've made on this are informed by the data and responsive to public opinion and defensible. I really do think that and I think not even defensible, probably necessary. Okay.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, I agree.\n\nChris Hayes: The bigger thing I have is just like, this is an issue across the world. We have, because of a combination of, essentially what colonialism has wrought hundreds of years later between the developed world and the developing world, right? Between places of relative stability and prosperity and places where people have a harder time living in peace and security. There is demand to move from --\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: -- one place to another. There are the means to do it, and climate change is going to exacerbate that. And like every sort of developed democracy is wrestling with this question and no one's doing a great job.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: And I'm just worried about what it portends for the future because, okay, you can make these tactical choices, but someone's got to sort of lay out a vision that's both orderly and lawful and humane that can get people on board because there is a powder keg here. There is an explosiveness to this politics that is very dangerous if it's allowed to go off.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah, and I always say the same thing. Like when you're reporting at the border, when I've been in the Darién jungle, like you really understand the basics of migration, which is that desperation knows no deterrence and knows no walls and knows no policies. And so I think any mother and father, aunts and uncle can understand that at the end, that human feeling.\n\nChris Hayes: Well, say more, because I think, you know, that point about desperation to me is really key because I think there's two things about it. One, I think people have a very hard time of thinking themselves as having come out on another roll of the dice in the natural lottery.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah.\n\nChris Hayes: Like, could have been you.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yes, and I think that's why Joe Biden's closing argument in 2020 was so powerful because it was literally along the lines of distancing Democrats from Trump's cruelty at the border. And it worked really well because he was able to tap into something that moms in the Midwest understood and fathers in Nebraska understood, which is the feeling of children being separated.\n\nChris Hayes: We're better than that.\n\nPaola Ramos: Yeah. And that we're better than this, right. And I think that humanity, that message, which was really simple, you know, we are better than that, I do think that had a lot to do with the last few weeks of Joe Biden's campaign with Trump. And so I think going back to that and not to humanizing, these beings that have been criminalized to the point that we're now thinking of them as animals and as threats. Like we have to bring people back to reality. And after four years of Trumpism, that's a really hard thing to do.\n\nChris Hayes: Yeah, that is the challenge.

She touted the creation of millions of jobs and low unemployment, including among Hispanics.\n\n\"The numbers tell us that the economy is stronger than it has been in a very long time ... it takes time for those accomplishments to be felt,\" she said in a phone interview Wednesday.\n\nHarris touted Biden administration policies that she said have benefited Latino families, including a cap on prescription drug s on seniors and a cap on insulin prices, which has had a direct impact on Latinos, who are 70% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than non-Hispanic whites.\n\nShe noted that the administration's m o re than $1 billion student loan debt forgiveness has helped many first-generation students, including Latinos , and its investment in community banks has boosted lending to Latino small businesses .\n\nHarris said \"our challenge is we just need to let people know who brought it to them.\"\n\nBut the campaign faces an uphill climb to reassure Latino voters that they are seeing better economic times. In recent years, many Latino and Black households h ave spent bigger shares of their household budgets on goods where inflation was highest, such as food and rent. That followed a couple of years of job and income losses when the Covid pandemic forced businesses to close.\n\nAn NBC News poll conducted in late January showed Biden's approval rating at just 35% among Latino registered voters. Biden and former President Donald Trump were tied among Latino voters (Trump 42% and Biden 41%) who were asked whom they would vote for in a rematch.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won 65% of Latino votes, compared to 32% for Trump.\n\nThe economy and jobs were ranked as their top concerns in a December survey of more than 3,000 Latinos eligible to vote by UnidosUS, an advocacy group.\n\nArturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said that the \"economy is top of mind\" in this election cycle, and that it's not just what polls are showing, \"but what I'm seeing and I'm hearing and people are reacting to.\"\n\nIn 2024, about 22% of Latinos will be voting in their first presidential election. Almost a quarter (24%) of Latino voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for the first time in 2022, according to the Brookings Institution , a liberal think tank.\n\nA 2024 UnidosUS survey of 1,500 Latino parents or caregivers of children ages 5 and under, reported that 30% said they were doing better than last year, a third said their situation was the same and 37% said they were doing worse. The survey had a 2.5% margin of error.\n\nHarris said that \"there's still more work to be done\" in a second presidential term, naming homeownership and rent reduction, as well as lower child care and home health care costs, as priorities.\n\nThe current levels of migration at the border and its repercussions on U.S. cities ha ve become top voter concern s in the 2024 election cycle and one of Trump's top point of attacks against Biden.\n\nHarris said that immigration is one issue on the November ballot where the choice between candidates is \"binary.\"\n\nTrump has said immigrants poison the blood of America,  he has \"killed\" the bipartisan border bill and has said that he would carry out a mass deportation operation , she said.\n\nIn contrast, Harris said, soon after Biden's inauguration, he proposed a bill that included a pathway to citizenship for eligible immigrants that Republicans would not take up.\n\n\"The reality is they would prefer to run on the problem, which is a broken immigration system, instead of fixing it,\" she said. \"We have people who have 10, 20 years living a very productive life, paying taxes, contributing to the economy who have no pathway to citizenship because the pathway is so broken.\"\n\nA recent Pew Research survey found that about three-quarters of Hispanics view the growing migration across the U.S.-Mexico border as a major problem or crisis and roughly the same share believe the federal government is doing a bad job of handling it.\n\nLatinos, however, are less likely than other Americans to see more deportations and more border wall as effective responses, according to the survey.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News a day before visiting an abortion clinic in Minnesota - a first for a president or vice president, Harris said reproductive rights is an issue on which she believes she and Biden have a majority of Latino voter support, citing that 40% of Latinas live in a state with an abortion ban.\n\nA Pew Research survey found t hat a majority of Latinos (57%) say abortion should be legal in at least some cases, including 69% of Democrats or those leaning Democrat and 39% of Hispanic Republicans or those leaning Republican.\n\nI am a San Antonio-based national reporter covering politics, immigration, race, demographics, culture, Latin America and major breaking news.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Tim Walz, breaking with its past practice of not formally supporting any political candidates.\n\nThe historic endorsement of the Democratic presidential ticket is the first for the civil rights group, which formed in 1929 to protect the rights of Americans of Mexican descent. LULAC leaders announced the endorsement first to NBC News and plan to join Harris and Walz at a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nThe endorsement was made through its political action committee, the LULAC Adelante PAC. LULAC is a nonprofit with a social welfare arm, and under federal tax law it cannot make political endorsements.\n\n\"We are proud to endorse Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because of the real issues facing Latino communities and all Americans across the nation; we can trust them to do what is right for our community and the country,\" Domingo Garcia, chairman of LULAC Adelante PAC and LULAC's immediate past president, said in a statement.\n\nNot all members of LULAC have been or are Democrats, but the group's objectives have mostly aligned with Democrats in modern history. LULAC had been considering creating a PAC for a few years, the organization said. But the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency created an urgency to do it now, said LULAC CEO Juan Proaño.\n\n\"The politics of hate mongering and scapegoating Latinos and immigrants must be stopped,\" Garcia said in the statement.\n\n\"Latinos understand how much is at stake in this election, for not only our community but our democracy,\" he stated.\n\nLULAC said its councils, essentially chapters based at the local  level, will step up support for the Democratic ticket in key battleground states. LULAC has 535 councils and 140,000 members, 86% of whom are registered voters, LULAC said. The organization has not previously done national get out the vote work.\n\nIn a statement, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris-Walz 2024 campaign manager, said the campaign was honored to earn LULAC's endorsement.\n\n\"They've never backed away from the fight for the communities they represent, and Vice President Harris has never stopped fighting to create opportunities for Latino families,\" she said. She listed lowering health care costs, increasing funding for Latino students and small business owners and addressing \"the plague of gun violence.\"\n\nWith the threat to Latinos of Trump and Project 2025 , a conservative coalitions' blueprint for a second Trump presidency, \"the stakes of this election require Latinos to unify and organize together like our lives depend on it,\" said Chavez Rodriguez, who is the granddaughter of civil rights leader Cesar Chavez.\n\nProaño said LULAC invited President Joe Biden and Trump to its annual conference in July this year. The Trump campaign never replied. Biden, who was then the presumptive Democratic nominee, was unable to attend, but Harris sent a videotaped message.\n\n\"Outreach communication and engagement with Harris since she became the nominee has been impressive. I got three phone calls in a week [from the campaign] on the Latino community,\" Proaño said.\n\nBiden won the majority of Latino voters in 2020, but polls were showing a decline in support this year.\n\nWhile historically LULAC has not endorsed candidates, its members have at times weighed in on political races.\n\nIn 1956, LULAC President Felix Tijerina personally endorsed the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket. LULAC members were active in Viva Kennedy clubs in 1960 and members have supported local Mexican American candidates, such as El Paso Mayor Raymond Telles.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nI am a San Antonio-based national reporter covering politics, immigration, race, demographics, culture, Latin America and major breaking news.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Similarly, In Arizona, she trails Trump by 12 points with Latino men ages 18-34 and by a whopping 20 points with those 35-49. \" Hombres con Harris \" is a last-minute attempt to stop that gap from growing by a party that has historically failed to engage and invest in Latino men.\n\n'Hombres con Harris' is a last-minute attempt by a party that has historically failed to engage and invest in Latino men.\n\nFocused solely on Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, the \" Hombres con Harris \" tour will feature vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and multiple Latino men, including Rep. Ruben Gallego , who's running for the Senate from Arizona, and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus . The tour will also feature digital creators and celebrities. In a statement, Harris' campaign said , \"At Latino-owned small businesses, sports bars, carnes asadas, union halls, and other community centered venues, the travel blitz will be focused on meeting Latino men where they are, in environments to discuss the issues that matter most to them and mobilize them to reach out to other Latino men, encouraging them to vote for Kamala Harris.\"\n\nGallego, who's leading in the polls as he seeks to become the first Latino U.S. senator from Arizona, made reaching out to Latino men in their own spaces a key campaign strategy. That strategy, which was seen as unique and effective, revealed a truth most Democrats do not want to admit: In states like Arizona and Nevada, where Latinos represent 25% and 20% of voters respectively , Democrats have historically done little to meet those voters where they are.\n\n\" It's about investing in young Latinos ,\" Cristina Tzintzún Ramírez, president of NextGen America, said on MSNBC last month when discussing some of the trends the Harris campaign is facing with Latinos. According to that September NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll, 59% of Latinos identified with the Democratic Party in 2016, but only 49% do in 2024.\n\nAs for Latino men, nationally, Harris still holds an advantage, as a Pew Research poll in late September shows her leading Trump with that demographic by 14 points. That's a significant improvement from a previous Pew poll that had President Joe Biden tied at 38% with Trump with such voters. But Harris' 14-point advantage with Latino men nationally is still less than the 17-point advantage Pew says Biden had over Trump with this demographic in 2020.\n\nPart of the problem is that Democrats are struggling to excite new Latino voters, a point confirmed by a UnidosUS poll from earlier this year . According to a UnidosUS briefing about that poll, \"younger voters are SIGNIFICANTLY more independent and less Democratic or Republican than more established voters.\" In the specific case of Latino men, there is enough data out there to conclude that Democrats are underperforming with those men who aren't college-educated .\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump campaign is tapping into a notion of masculinity and \"bro\" appeal that may highlight some voters' unwillingness to vote for a woman.\n\nHowever, placing the blame solely on Latino men is shortsighted. Democrats should have already been reaching out to them with more purpose. The \"Hombres con Harris\" effort is a start and might move some Latino men back toward Democrats before Election Day, but it's not a viable long-term solution. Such a solution would involve deeper investments in Latino outreach efforts, and that takes time, more consistent commitment and a desire to listen to key concerns such as the cost of living and the economy\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign should do its best with Latino men in the next month, but its better option may be to run up the score with Latina women.\n\nThe story about the USA Today/Suffolk University poll says that \" Latina women of all ages prefer Harris to Trump. For example, 62% of Latinas ages 18-24 said they support Harris compared to 33% who said they support Trump.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign should do its best with Latino men, but its better option may be to run up the score with Latina women.\n\nWhen it comes to Latina women, Harris has a chance to dominate that vote. Voter registrations are up for Latinas in 2024. For example, advocacy group Voto Latino, which has formally endorsed Harris, said last month that its registration work has increased by 200% since Harris announced her candidacy. In 10 days at the end of July, the organization, which works to increase turnout among Latino voters, noted that 70% of its 50,000 registrations were women , with the most registrations happening in states like Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida.\n\n\"If you go to college, you're much more likely to be a Democrat, and if you don't, you're more likely to be a Republican,\" Latino political strategist Mike Madrid told the Miami Herald last month. \"It's this new voter under 30, our men have not gone to college, and our women have, and it has manifested itself in our politics now.\"\n\n\"Hombres con Harris\" won't hurt, but more get-out-the-vote initiatives hyperfocused on Latinas is the smarter play for now.\n\nMaybe \"Hombres con Harris\" will help win some Latino men back in states like Arizona and Nevada. But it should have never gotten to the place where so many hombres feel left out and ignored.\n\nJulio Ricardo Varela is an award-winning journalist and the founder of The Latino Newsletter.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Activate your online access\n\nEvery September 15, a flurry of independence days across Central America-in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras-kicks off National Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration of Latin culture that lasts through mid-October. For Latin Americans and their descendants, the month is a time to celebrate shared cultures and customs across nationalities. For others in the United States, it provides an opportunity to educate Americans about a growing demographic that, like most minorities, has long been relegated to the margins of US history and, over the past half-century, has worn many hats-\"Latin American,\" \"Hispanic,\" \"Latino,\" and most recently, \"Latinx.\" Now, however, a growing number of writers, activists, and academics are questioning the very underpinnings of this common identity, an idea known as Latinidad (loosely translated as \"Latino-ness\"). Historically, the forging of this ethnic identity has been understood as a necessity in the face of white supremacy and anti-Mexican Juan Crow laws. In response to recent events, it's been useful for raising awareness of migrant family separations, Washington's insistence on militarizing borders in Mexico and Central America, and mass shooters warning of a \"Hispanic invasion\" of the United States. Even so, its most vocal critics, who are often young and black or indigenous, have not minced words in their critique of what they see as an exclusionary identity fabricated by-and for the benefit of-white and mestizo elites and the American political class. I spoke about the recent rejection of Latinidad with the journalists, organizers, and thinkers at the forefront of this conversation. We talked about what determines who is allowed to claim the term, what purpose it serves, and whether the identity is useful as a category anymore. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. - Miguel Salazar Amanda Alcántara is a Dominican journalist and digital media editor at Futuro Media Group. Daniel Alvarenga is a Salvadoran journalist and a video producer at AJ+ . Rosa Clemente is a black Puerto Rican journalist, organizer, and founder of Puerto Rico on the Map. Kristian Hernandez is a Mexican-American organizer in Texas with the Democratic Socialists of America. Janel Martinez is a Bronx-born Garifuna journalist and founder of Ain't I Latina? Alan Pelaez Lopez is a Zapotec cultural critic, artist, and academic. Miguel Salazar: What has been fueling the growing rejection of Latinidad in recent months? Do you identify as Latinx? Alan Pelaez Lopez: I think that the rejection has been pretty alive in indigenous communities who migrate from Latin America and the Caribbean to the US. I think, in the last five years especially, we're seeing a critique from Latin Americans on the single narrative of Latinidad. The rejection of Latinidad embraces nuance by inviting people who have traditionally been silenced in the US and also in their countries of birth. And I don't have any desire to be Latinx because I don't think that my end goal is to reclaim a community that has never accepted me. Rosa Clemente: \"Latinidad\" is an academic term that failed because it erases away race. For those of us who are black Puerto Ricans or maybe identify as indigenous, what it really does is it just waters down who we are and it erases blackness. The whole term is flawed. Amanda Alcántara: The word I've been using to identify is \"Afro-Caribbean\" because it is regional and specific to places that are often excluded in our perception of who Latin America represents. I still use the word \"Latina,\" but because it's used in the US. As a journalist, I cover Latino issues, specifically Afro-Latinx issues and Dominican issues, so I still rely on the term even if I don't want to identify with it. What happens when you subscribe to the idea of a single Latinidad narrative is you create a monolith-culturally and politically-of an entire continent when every single country and every single community has their own history. Daniel Alvarenga: Latinidad in general doesn't make room to talk about US imperialism, either. It doesn't make room to talk about conflict. [As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box. MS: Should there be a common Latin identity? What purpose should it serve? APL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white? APL: In the US, when people see my body, they identify me as black. I've traveled outside the US, and in South Africa, I was seen as a colored person. In West Africa, I was seen as white. We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nHistorically, the forging of this ethnic identity has been understood as a necessity in the face of white supremacy and anti-Mexican Juan Crow laws.

DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white? APL: In the US, when people see my body, they identify me as black. I've traveled outside the US, and in South Africa, I was seen as a colored person. In West Africa, I was seen as white. We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. - Miguel Salazar Amanda Alcántara is a Dominican journalist and digital media editor at Futuro Media Group. Daniel Alvarenga is a Salvadoran journalist and a video producer at AJ+ . Rosa Clemente is a black Puerto Rican journalist, organizer, and founder of Puerto Rico on the Map. Kristian Hernandez is a Mexican-American organizer in Texas with the Democratic Socialists of America. Janel Martinez is a Bronx-born Garifuna journalist and founder of Ain't I Latina? Alan Pelaez Lopez is a Zapotec cultural critic, artist, and academic. Miguel Salazar: What has been fueling the growing rejection of Latinidad in recent months? Do you identify as Latinx? Alan Pelaez Lopez: I think that the rejection has been pretty alive in indigenous communities who migrate from Latin America and the Caribbean to the US. I think, in the last five years especially, we're seeing a critique from Latin Americans on the single narrative of Latinidad. The rejection of Latinidad embraces nuance by inviting people who have traditionally been silenced in the US and also in their countries of birth. And I don't have any desire to be Latinx because I don't think that my end goal is to reclaim a community that has never accepted me. Rosa Clemente: \"Latinidad\" is an academic term that failed because it erases away race. For those of us who are black Puerto Ricans or maybe identify as indigenous, what it really does is it just waters down who we are and it erases blackness. The whole term is flawed. Amanda Alcántara: The word I've been using to identify is \"Afro-Caribbean\" because it is regional and specific to places that are often excluded in our perception of who Latin America represents. I still use the word \"Latina,\" but because it's used in the US. As a journalist, I cover Latino issues, specifically Afro-Latinx issues and Dominican issues, so I still rely on the term even if I don't want to identify with it. What happens when you subscribe to the idea of a single Latinidad narrative is you create a monolith-culturally and politically-of an entire continent when every single country and every single community has their own history. Daniel Alvarenga: Latinidad in general doesn't make room to talk about US imperialism, either. It doesn't make room to talk about conflict. [As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box. MS: Should there be a common Latin identity? What purpose should it serve? APL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity.

RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nDaniel Alvarenga is a Salvadoran journalist and a video producer at AJ+ . Rosa Clemente is a black Puerto Rican journalist, organizer, and founder of Puerto Rico on the Map. Kristian Hernandez is a Mexican-American organizer in Texas with the Democratic Socialists of America. Janel Martinez is a Bronx-born Garifuna journalist and founder of Ain't I Latina? Alan Pelaez Lopez is a Zapotec cultural critic, artist, and academic. Miguel Salazar: What has been fueling the growing rejection of Latinidad in recent months? Do you identify as Latinx? Alan Pelaez Lopez: I think that the rejection has been pretty alive in indigenous communities who migrate from Latin America and the Caribbean to the US. I think, in the last five years especially, we're seeing a critique from Latin Americans on the single narrative of Latinidad. The rejection of Latinidad embraces nuance by inviting people who have traditionally been silenced in the US and also in their countries of birth. And I don't have any desire to be Latinx because I don't think that my end goal is to reclaim a community that has never accepted me. Rosa Clemente: \"Latinidad\" is an academic term that failed because it erases away race. For those of us who are black Puerto Ricans or maybe identify as indigenous, what it really does is it just waters down who we are and it erases blackness. The whole term is flawed. Amanda Alcántara: The word I've been using to identify is \"Afro-Caribbean\" because it is regional and specific to places that are often excluded in our perception of who Latin America represents. I still use the word \"Latina,\" but because it's used in the US. As a journalist, I cover Latino issues, specifically Afro-Latinx issues and Dominican issues, so I still rely on the term even if I don't want to identify with it. What happens when you subscribe to the idea of a single Latinidad narrative is you create a monolith-culturally and politically-of an entire continent when every single country and every single community has their own history. Daniel Alvarenga: Latinidad in general doesn't make room to talk about US imperialism, either. It doesn't make room to talk about conflict. [As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box. MS: Should there be a common Latin identity? What purpose should it serve? APL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white? APL: In the US, when people see my body, they identify me as black. I've traveled outside the US, and in South Africa, I was seen as a colored person. In West Africa, I was seen as white. We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people.

[As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box. MS: Should there be a common Latin identity? What purpose should it serve? APL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white? APL: In the US, when people see my body, they identify me as black. I've traveled outside the US, and in South Africa, I was seen as a colored person. In West Africa, I was seen as white. We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nAlan Pelaez Lopez is a Zapotec cultural critic, artist, and academic. Miguel Salazar: What has been fueling the growing rejection of Latinidad in recent months? Do you identify as Latinx? Alan Pelaez Lopez: I think that the rejection has been pretty alive in indigenous communities who migrate from Latin America and the Caribbean to the US. I think, in the last five years especially, we're seeing a critique from Latin Americans on the single narrative of Latinidad. The rejection of Latinidad embraces nuance by inviting people who have traditionally been silenced in the US and also in their countries of birth. And I don't have any desire to be Latinx because I don't think that my end goal is to reclaim a community that has never accepted me. Rosa Clemente: \"Latinidad\" is an academic term that failed because it erases away race. For those of us who are black Puerto Ricans or maybe identify as indigenous, what it really does is it just waters down who we are and it erases blackness. The whole term is flawed. Amanda Alcántara: The word I've been using to identify is \"Afro-Caribbean\" because it is regional and specific to places that are often excluded in our perception of who Latin America represents. I still use the word \"Latina,\" but because it's used in the US. As a journalist, I cover Latino issues, specifically Afro-Latinx issues and Dominican issues, so I still rely on the term even if I don't want to identify with it. What happens when you subscribe to the idea of a single Latinidad narrative is you create a monolith-culturally and politically-of an entire continent when every single country and every single community has their own history. Daniel Alvarenga: Latinidad in general doesn't make room to talk about US imperialism, either. It doesn't make room to talk about conflict. [As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box.

We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nRosa Clemente: \"Latinidad\" is an academic term that failed because it erases away race. For those of us who are black Puerto Ricans or maybe identify as indigenous, what it really does is it just waters down who we are and it erases blackness. The whole term is flawed. Amanda Alcántara: The word I've been using to identify is \"Afro-Caribbean\" because it is regional and specific to places that are often excluded in our perception of who Latin America represents. I still use the word \"Latina,\" but because it's used in the US. As a journalist, I cover Latino issues, specifically Afro-Latinx issues and Dominican issues, so I still rely on the term even if I don't want to identify with it. What happens when you subscribe to the idea of a single Latinidad narrative is you create a monolith-culturally and politically-of an entire continent when every single country and every single community has their own history. Daniel Alvarenga: Latinidad in general doesn't make room to talk about US imperialism, either. It doesn't make room to talk about conflict. [As a Salvadoran,] I might have a stronger bond with people from countries that have undergone conflicts, but I can't make those connections so easily, because I'm stuck in this Latinx box. MS: Should there be a common Latin identity? What purpose should it serve? APL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white?

But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nAPL: I don't know that there should be a common Latinx identity. This identity is rooted in land and geography when it should be rooted in understanding settler colonialism in the Americas. I would be invested in a political Latinidad that first and foremost fought for indigenous sovereignty and black liberation. If it doesn't do that, I don't see the purpose. AA: Part of me thinks there is a use to the term because we still don't have a better alternative at the moment. I think that hyperlocal is the way to go in terms of identifying in the future. Then you don't have to add something like \"Latin,\" which adds a whole other layer of meaning. RC: When elections start to happen, you have more and more people who have visibility, usually white-passing Latino, Latina, Latinx people who also want us to encompass this 60 million people demographic, assuming that we're all going to vote Democrat. That's what they're really trying to do, because they know that we're essentially the swing vote. Janel Martinez: A lot of these terms come from the emergence of marketing and advertising agencies and are also used for political purposes and data [collection] in the US. Despite that being the case, whether we use \"Hispanic,\" whether we use \"Latinx,\" whether people go with their racial identity, whether they go with their nationality, lived experiences still are at play. There are still overlapping experiences, no matter the term, and there are still experiences to be acknowledged, whether they are using the term or not. MS: What role should nationality play in constructing a larger sense of Latin identity? APL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island. DA: There are things we share across the board. I think everyone consumes Goya products, we consume certain staple foods like rice and beans, but is that Latinidad? At the end of the day, Latinidad doesn't get to the core of this, which is that some of the things that we consider Latinx are actually indigenous or African traditions that have a very painful history. We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white?

We don't think, \"Oh, we all eat plátanos , and plátanos come from Africa.\" We think, \"This is Latino food.\" What does that mean? We think of tamales as a Latino food, but it's an indigenous food. Latinidad kind of glosses over how Latinidad came to be, which has a very ugly history that doesn't really get acknowledged. APL: Living in California has made me really critical of Latinidad. Mexican folks here are very nationalistic, but the Central American community, because of Mexico's nationalism, has pushed back so much that they've actually become anti-indigenous in their narrative. It has created a binary opposition where Central American identity depends on borders. But I know Zapotec people living in Guatemala. There are Maya in the Yucatán peninsula, there are Maya in El Salvador, in Guatemala, in Belize. I think that Central American Twitter, because of Mexican nationalism, has tried to retaliate, but has accidentally perpetuated indigenous erasure. MS: Latin America is racialized differently from in the US. How do we grapple with that in a country where conversations on race can be so black and white? APL: In the US, when people see my body, they identify me as black. I've traveled outside the US, and in South Africa, I was seen as a colored person. In West Africa, I was seen as white. We have to know that race changes-not just country by country but even state by state. In Oaxaca, my body is not questioned because there are so many people that look like me. But when I enter Mexico City, I'm always in question. We are racialized. We don't get to claim a race. People tell us what we are dependent on the geography that they're in. JM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably. There are people who are white or white-passing and comfortable with being called a person of color. You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nAPL: I don't even think it's nationality. Those who can identify with Hispanic or Latinx are those who benefit from power because of language, race and religion. Latinidad offers them a whole community, and then they become the ones at the top of it because they speak proper Spanish and they know their culture and they come from a Christian or Catholic background, whereas people who are practitioners of curanderismo or Santeria, who speak a bastard Spanish, who speak indigenous languages, or who come from other colonies in the Americas are erased from that identity. There is a privilege to being able to identify as Latinx and never be questioned about it, while those who are questioned are informed that they have less power. DA: There are groups that have the most population, so they also get to shape Latinidad. I grew up outside LA, and Latinidad to me was Mexican culture and Salvadoran culture. You have tacos, people were blasting rancheras . I've talked to my friends who grew up in DC, where I live now, and Salvadorans are the majority immigrant group, so Latinidad here looks different. My Salvadoran friends who grew up in New York know more bachata songs than I do and probably know how to dance bachata better because of their proximity to folks who are Spanish-speaking Caribbeans. AA: As someone who is Dominican and someone who is black, why should I be identifying with a term that is inclusive of folks in the region of Latin America but doesn't necessarily include Jamaicans, who are right next to the Dominican Republic? It doesn't include Trinidad and Tobago or other islands that have a lot in common with the Dominican Republic by virtue of also being a black Caribbean island.

You have one foot in, one foot out, because there are situations in which you are identifying as a person of color but you take any opportunity you have to separate yourself from black and indigenous people. RC: In America, everyone has a black and white discussion about race, but when they say \"black,\" which group of black people are they talking about? They're not talking about Haitians, they're not talking about Nigerians, they're not talking about Ethiopians. With President [Jair] Bolsonaro, Afro-Brazilians are being killed every day by the state. In Colombia, Afro-indigenous people and Afro-Colombians face the same violence. It's hard to have these discussions when \"black\" in the US automatically means African American and leaves out other black people, especially people from the African continent and the Caribbean. AA: When you look at the history of the US-at Chicanos, at the southern border-these people were an intrinsic part of the United States, and it's kind of insane that Latinxs are not considered in the conception of what America is. But at the same time, neither are black people. I think that black folks are still also very much oppressed by the US and oppressed by white supremacy and there is a camaraderie there that has been historic and that also doesn't get a lot of attention. I think the reason why is, by bringing all people of color together, then you create the conditions to question the national identity and, honestly, also for protest and revolution. MS: How has this identity informed your politics? Kristian Hernandez: It's important that those of us who are still connected to other countries should continue to forge and strengthen those connections. For a lot of us who consider ourselves socialists, we know it's going to require an international movement and international solidarity. Are we having those relationships forged? The trust that often comes with a shared home or a shared group makes it a lot easier to navigate political struggle and to be in touch with the communities that are impacted in other parts of the world, and that better informs where we can support other movements on the left in other countries. DA: If you're not interrogating Latinidad in smart ways, you're celebrating colonialism in a way. And those independence days [kicking off Hispanic Heritage Month] in most of those countries are fake. We don't have a whole lot of sovereignty. In El Salvador, we don't have our own money, we are not independent from global capital and American interests. It gives you cultural pride to have that month, but at some point, are we just celebrating that we were colonized?\n\nJM: Some people still don't understand that Latinx is an ethnic group, not a racial category, and a lot of people to this day use it interchangeably.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Exhibit A: Trump's stronger than expected showing in heavily Latino parts of Texas, which quickly became an article of faith among journalists and operatives alike. Last week's results in the Texas primary elections, however, shattered that conventional wisdom, as Latino voters flocked to unapologetically progressive candidates. It turns out that Latinos aren't turned off by progressive politics after all. In July, data analyst David Shor, one of the most prominent proponents of the idea that left politics repelled Latinos in 2020, spoke to NPR in an interview titled, \" Latino Voters Are Leaving The Democratic Party .\" Others piled on, with Eric Levitz writing in New York magazine, \"No political development worries blue America's operatives more than Hispanic voters' rightward drift.\" A central data point they cite is the declining Democratic margin in places like Hidalgo County, on the Mexican border, where Barack Obama won by 42 percent in 2012, but Biden bested Trump by only 1.9 percent. The shrinking margins, they say, reflect an exodus of Latinos out of the Democratic Party and over to the Republican ranks, spelling potential doom for the party's prospects. Shor assigns blame for the smaller margin to \"the increased salience of socialism in 2020-with the rise of AOC and the prominence of anti-socialist messaging from the GOP.\" But then a funny thing happened on the way to the a for progressive Latino politics. In last week's Texas primary elections, unapologetically progressive Latino candidates performed exceedingly well across the state. The population of the state's 35th Congressional District, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio, is 60 percent Latino. Voters there delivered an overwhelming victory to democratic socialist Greg Casar, an Austin city councilor backed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and running against a much more moderate opponent, Eddie Rodriquez. In the statewide primary for attorney general, progressive former ACLU attorney Rochelle Garza bested both of her opponents by a more than 2 to 1 margin. And in the congressional race on the border-the region Shor and others point to as most indicative of the Latino shift to the right-progressive Jessica Cisneros battled one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, long-time incumbent Henry Cuellar, to a near-tie, sending the race to a runoff in May. So what gives? How are Latinos both fleeing the perceived left politics of the Democratic Party and also electing candidates from the party's left wing?

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The first answer is that the pundits are misreading the data. Democratic margins have in fact shrunk in South Texas-but not because Latino Democrats are switching their allegiances to the Republicans. In Hidalgo County, for example, Biden got 22,000 more votes than Obama did. Vote totals doesn't go up if voters are defecting. What requires careful inspection is that Republicans, and Trump in particular, have been doing a better job of mobilizing conservative infrequent voters, while Democrats have neglected the importance of boosting voter turnout. Though Democrats did see an increase in Hidalgo County in 2020, the Republican increase was much larger, with Trump getting 75,000 more votes than Romney received against Obama. That's what explains the shrinking margin. As Equis Labs outlined in its report on the 2020 election, Trump's \"gains happened among voters usually on the sidelines of politics.\" Therein lies the challenge for Democrats-how to generate greater enthusiasm among Latino infrequent voters. The answer is the opposite of current conventional wisdom: The Democrats' enthusiasm gap stems from being too timid and moderate, not from being too left and radical. Two overarching realities predispose people of color, including Latinos, to progressive politics-that is, far-reaching political and economic change. The first reality is economics, in general, and the racial wealth gap , in particular. The average Latino family in America has just $36,000 in assets, while the average white family's net worth is $188,000. The Latino poverty rate of 15.7 percent is twice as high as that of whites (7.3 percent). It only makes logical sense that prioritizing economic equality would be well-received in a community wrestling with major economic challenges. Current Issue View our current issue The second reality is the unrelenting and escalating promotion of white supremacy. The most extreme and tragic expression of the hostility toward Latinos came in 2019, when a young white man drove 10 hours to El Paso, Tex., headed to a Wal-Mart whose customers were mainly Latino, and proceeded to murder 22 people with an assault weapon. A manifesto that police linked to the killer states that he acted out of fear that \"the United States will soon become a one-party state run by Democrats because of the growing Hispanic population.\" While that was the most extreme recent example, it is not the only one. Hate crimes against Latinos reached an 11-year high in 2019, according to a 2020 FBI report . In Texas, anti-Latino hostility gets expressed in myriad ways, from defending monuments, to white supremacist Confederates, to the anti-\"critical race theory\" bill that stripped out the words \"Chicano movement,\" \"Cesar Chavez,\" and \"Dolores Huerta\" from the education code's directives about what should be taught in Texas schools. The everyday reality of relentless racism creates the conditions for those most affected by racism to be more receptive to anti-racist politics. Greg Casar comes from, understands, and speaks to those underlying realities of the Latino lived experience. The second sentence of his website says, \"The proud son of Mexican immigrants, Greg has passed policies to protect families from being separated, raised wages for thousands of workers, and has successfully fought to expand civil rights protections.\" Proud Mexican-American. Economic equality and civil rights. Followed by a dominating victory. It's really not that complicated. The reason Democrats don't inspire the level of excitement that they could among Latinos is that the first principle of party politics is to not do anything that insecure and anxious white voters might disapprove of. As a result, Democrats keep their distance, muting their support for justice and equality for people of color. Insufficient policy commitments and invisible cultural and symbolic cultural connections to the community make for lukewarm enthusiasm. If Democrats really want to increase support among Latinos, they should deploy the full arsenal of tools at their disposal. The prominence and prestige of the Bully Pulpit should be used to elevate the prominence and profile of Latino leaders. Biden should invite Harris County's top executive, Lina Hidalgo, to the White House for a high-profile conversation about innovative public policy solutions to intractable problems. The Democratic National Committee, which has raised $161 million in this cycle, should direct its biggest donors to invest tens of millions of dollars in Latino-led civic engagement organizations such as the Texas Organizing Project. And the White House should use its executive authority to cancel student debt, a move that is supported by 72 percent of Latinos . (A step that makes even more sense given that Latinos have the youngest median age , 30, of all racial groups.) None of this is rocket science. Stacey Abrams and Lauren Groh-Wargo wrote a 4,101 word essay for The New York Times titled, \" How to Turn Your Red State Blue .\" The secret? \"Organizing was and is the soul of how we operate every day. Our organizing centers, always, on everyday people dealing with deep wealth and income inequality and structural racism, with xenophobia and bigotry.\" Last week's results show that Latinos are ready for leadership that promises change. And when your day-to-day life is defined by economic challenges and racist obstacles, progressive change is the order of the day.\n\nIn July, data analyst David Shor, one of the most prominent proponents of the idea that left politics repelled Latinos in 2020, spoke to NPR in an interview titled, \" Latino Voters Are Leaving The Democratic Party .\" Others piled on, with Eric Levitz writing in New York magazine, \"No political development worries blue America's operatives more than Hispanic voters' rightward drift.\" A central data point they cite is the declining Democratic margin in places like Hidalgo County, on the Mexican border, where Barack Obama won by 42 percent in 2012, but Biden bested Trump by only 1.9 percent.

The answer is the opposite of current conventional wisdom: The Democrats' enthusiasm gap stems from being too timid and moderate, not from being too left and radical. Two overarching realities predispose people of color, including Latinos, to progressive politics-that is, far-reaching political and economic change. The first reality is economics, in general, and the racial wealth gap , in particular. The average Latino family in America has just $36,000 in assets, while the average white family's net worth is $188,000. The Latino poverty rate of 15.7 percent is twice as high as that of whites (7.3 percent). It only makes logical sense that prioritizing economic equality would be well-received in a community wrestling with major economic challenges. Current Issue View our current issue The second reality is the unrelenting and escalating promotion of white supremacy. The most extreme and tragic expression of the hostility toward Latinos came in 2019, when a young white man drove 10 hours to El Paso, Tex., headed to a Wal-Mart whose customers were mainly Latino, and proceeded to murder 22 people with an assault weapon. A manifesto that police linked to the killer states that he acted out of fear that \"the United States will soon become a one-party state run by Democrats because of the growing Hispanic population.\" While that was the most extreme recent example, it is not the only one. Hate crimes against Latinos reached an 11-year high in 2019, according to a 2020 FBI report . In Texas, anti-Latino hostility gets expressed in myriad ways, from defending monuments, to white supremacist Confederates, to the anti-\"critical race theory\" bill that stripped out the words \"Chicano movement,\" \"Cesar Chavez,\" and \"Dolores Huerta\" from the education code's directives about what should be taught in Texas schools. The everyday reality of relentless racism creates the conditions for those most affected by racism to be more receptive to anti-racist politics. Greg Casar comes from, understands, and speaks to those underlying realities of the Latino lived experience. The second sentence of his website says, \"The proud son of Mexican immigrants, Greg has passed policies to protect families from being separated, raised wages for thousands of workers, and has successfully fought to expand civil rights protections.\" Proud Mexican-American. Economic equality and civil rights. Followed by a dominating victory. It's really not that complicated. The reason Democrats don't inspire the level of excitement that they could among Latinos is that the first principle of party politics is to not do anything that insecure and anxious white voters might disapprove of. As a result, Democrats keep their distance, muting their support for justice and equality for people of color. Insufficient policy commitments and invisible cultural and symbolic cultural connections to the community make for lukewarm enthusiasm. If Democrats really want to increase support among Latinos, they should deploy the full arsenal of tools at their disposal. The prominence and prestige of the Bully Pulpit should be used to elevate the prominence and profile of Latino leaders. Biden should invite Harris County's top executive, Lina Hidalgo, to the White House for a high-profile conversation about innovative public policy solutions to intractable problems. The Democratic National Committee, which has raised $161 million in this cycle, should direct its biggest donors to invest tens of millions of dollars in Latino-led civic engagement organizations such as the Texas Organizing Project. And the White House should use its executive authority to cancel student debt, a move that is supported by 72 percent of Latinos . (A step that makes even more sense given that Latinos have the youngest median age , 30, of all racial groups.) None of this is rocket science. Stacey Abrams and Lauren Groh-Wargo wrote a 4,101 word essay for The New York Times titled, \" How to Turn Your Red State Blue .\" The secret? \"Organizing was and is the soul of how we operate every day. Our organizing centers, always, on everyday people dealing with deep wealth and income inequality and structural racism, with xenophobia and bigotry.\" Last week's results show that Latinos are ready for leadership that promises change. And when your day-to-day life is defined by economic challenges and racist obstacles, progressive change is the order of the day.\n\nSo what gives? How are Latinos both fleeing the perceived left politics of the Democratic Party and also electing candidates from the party's left wing?

Democratic margins have in fact shrunk in South Texas-but not because Latino Democrats are switching their allegiances to the Republicans. In Hidalgo County, for example, Biden got 22,000 more votes than Obama did. Vote totals doesn't go up if voters are defecting. What requires careful inspection is that Republicans, and Trump in particular, have been doing a better job of mobilizing conservative infrequent voters, while Democrats have neglected the importance of boosting voter turnout. Though Democrats did see an increase in Hidalgo County in 2020, the Republican increase was much larger, with Trump getting 75,000 more votes than Romney received against Obama.

Nor is one likely to emerge until later in the week, when the votes are fully tabulated in slow-counting swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Still, it is clear that the race will not be, as some had predicted, a blow-out for Joe Biden. Biden has already lost the crucial swing state of Florida. He has also underperformed in Georgia and North Carolina. It looks like if Biden wins, the path is through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, with possible help from Arizona and Nebraska's 2nd district. The race is much closer in large part because Biden is performing worse than Hillary Clinton did among people of color, especially Latinos. Explaining Trump's Florida victory, New York Times polling analyst Nate Cohn notes that \"Trump is doing way, way better than 2016 in Hispanic and Cuban areas. He's also doing better in majority black precincts. Biden *is* doing better in older and relatively white areas.... But not by much-and that doesn't cut it in diverse FL.\" There has been a consistent pattern in polling for most of 2020 of Biden doing better with white voters than Hillary Clinton, while doing worse than she did among people of color. Clinton herself did worse than Barack Obama with people of color. So the current election follows a pattern, going back nearly a decade, of Democrats losing their edge with people of color. Even if Biden should win, this pattern should give the party pause, especially since it is doing so against a notorious bigot like Donald Trump. If Trump is doing better with people of color, it's for the same reason he has improved the Republican Party's edge among non-college-educated white voters: class. Trump talks the language of bread-and-butter economics, promising jobs. Democrats, with the exception of the progressive wing of the party, have abandoned class language and instead focus on national unity. The problem with Trump, to hear Biden tell it, is that he's a divisive figure. Biden, to be sure, bluntly criticizes Trump's bigotry. But Biden, like Clinton, is also eager to pursue erstwhile Republicans, many of whom are suburban whites. In tailoring their message to these voters, Biden and Clinton have softened the economic populism Democrat need to win working-class voters. As HuffPost writer Zach Carter observes , \"the big shift so far is Democrats losing ground with Black and Latino voters. If that holds, then Democrats have to do some soul-searching, and then some resigning.\" The travesty of this election is that Biden's problems with Latino voters were well-known. Biden did worse among them than Bernie Sanders did. The Biden campaign could have turned to Sanders for advice on how to solve this problem. Instead, it did nothing. As Politico reported in May: Current Issue View our current issue Joe Biden won the primary in spite of, not because of, his efforts to turn out Latinos. Two months later, Hispanic leaders are waiting on his campaign to deliver on its promises to do more. In interviews, more than 20 Latino political operatives, lawmakers, and activists said they don't see a game plan from Biden to marshal Hispanic voters effectively in the fall. They said there's little evidence the campaign is devoting the resources or hiring the staff that task will require-all the more crucial during a pandemic, when reaching and mobilizing Latino voters through in-person canvassing is nearly impossible. Even if Biden wins, there needs to be soul-searching on the part of both Democrats and progressives. As Yale law professor Samuel Moyn asks , \"How can the progressive outlook not require a major overhaul if it succeeds thanks to well-off suburbs, with some evidence of softening minority support?\"\n\nThe race is much closer in large part because Biden is performing worse than Hillary Clinton did among people of color, especially Latinos.

It's a small town in south Texas, a land where most census tracts are over 90 percent Tejano, or US-born Texans of Mexican descent. \"The first time I shot them, I felt a lot of empathy. My heart still goes out to these guys because they're unarmed.\" Related Article America's Changing Racial Makeup Won't Magically Save the Democratic Party Julianne Hing Despite his reservations, Dominguez, a 34-year-old Tejano who is a newspaper delivery coordinator from San Antonio, marched with his fellow shooters alongside the troop of white men, helped line the men up, and then shot them. Most of the hundreds of spectators gathered to see the mock execution are white, with some Tejanos mixed in. Several in the audience cry; and still others yell, \"Nooooo!\" and boo loudly. Dominguez acknowledges their feelings, but holds his political ground in his role as a cazadero-a scout and sharpshooter in the Mexican army that fought in the March 1863 Battle of Coleto Creek. He is one of hundreds of volunteers who pay thousands of dollars for the uniforms, guns, tents, and other paraphernalia they use during this annual reenactment of the \"Massacre at Goliad.\" Now in its 31st year, the reenactment of the battle, and the executions Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ordered after the battle, recalls the fighting and settlement that led to Texas's independence from Mexico. \"It was common practice to execute people,\" says Dominguez. \"The Americans were deemed pirates, which meant they were bearing arms against a government and not fighting with official flag, kind of like what we call terrorists today.\" Dominguez's comments inspire his colleague, William Bennett, a 67-year-old native of the Houston suburb Katy, to lead the conversation into the political battles raging in the Texas present. \"If Donald Trump were alive at the time of the Goliad massacre, he'd have been on the Mexican side,\" says Bennett, referring to how mixed both sides were in terms of nationality and ethnic and racial identity. Speaking for the Mexican army of 1836, he explains, \"We were protecting our country, our borders from foreigners. These foreigners want the same equal rights as Mexican citizens, but they don't pay taxes, they don't learn our language-Spanish-they don't become Catholics. They came here to steal land. So, to be historically accurate, Trump would have to be on the Mexican side.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Bennett, in his real life role as Texas voter, says he likes Trump because \"he's against the establishment.\" Dominguez, who prefers Texas Senator Ted Cruz, says he will vote Trump if he wins the nomination. Neither man would, in Dominguez's terms, \"ever vote for Hillary Clinton.\" Like most of their peers in the reenactment, both Bennett and Dominguez have studied Texas history closely. Both believe early-19th-century culture and politics made Texas very dynamic, a place where the shifting sands of political identity rendered attempts to institute political and physical borders here futile, something the insurgent campaigns of Trump, Cruz, and Bernie Sanders indicate is happening again. Deep-rooted dynamics among and between whites and Latinos in Texas, a state with a whopping 38 electoral votes, continue playing a critical role in the future of Texas and presidential elections. And things will only keep being unpredictable, even zany as Texas inches towards becoming, like the other western Latino behemoth of California, another Latino-majority state. This is the context for the state's conflicts, and conflicting developments: This week's unanimous Supreme Court decision sustaining a Texas-based challenge to the one-person-one-vote principle dealt a setback to anti-Latino forces who hoped to redraw legislative districts based on eligible voters instead of total population (79 percent of Texas's whites are eligible to vote, but only 46 percent of Latinos); polls showing that immigration and border security are, respectively, the number-one and -two issues for Texas voters, but with Latinos and whites having very clear divisions on these issues. Texas has 2.2 million registered Latino voters and another 2.6 million who are eligible, but not registered, and they will eventually turn over the political tortilla in Texas. But, then, Texas being Texas, 48 percent of these Latinos gave their vote to Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2014, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino voters. * * * Taking tickets in front of the defensive stone walls at the entrance to Presidio de la Bahia (the former Spanish and Mexican fort that became Fort Goliad), Kenneth Buelter described the new political walls here and across the country. \"The new voters that you're seeing in all these primaries are part of the 80 percent that has felt like everything revolves around minorities-whether LGBT, whether immigrants, whatever portion is smallest-everything revolves around them. A lot of these voters that Trump is bringing out are people who don't feel like they've had a voice until now.\" As county chair of the Republican Party, Buelter's job is to find that voice and amplify what it's saying. Until the year 2000, it was often the voice of Democrats working in cattle, oil, and tourism industries. The resentment that followed the decline of these industries opened spaces for Republicans like Buetler, the former chapter president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, to snatch all of the countywide seats and half of the local seats. As of the Republican primary last march, Goliad and Texas became \"Cruz country,\" says Buetler, who sees the potential for \"rebellion\" at the Texas convention, whose 9,000 delegates make the event the \"the biggest convention of Republicans in the world.\" It will also be possibly the biggest Republican slugfest in the world, says Buetler. \"The Texas state convention is going to have a large Trump faction and a large Cruz faction,\" says Buetler. The high-profile personal attacks of both candidates, Buetler admits, have damaged the party overall, but he adds, \"The only chance the party has of electing someone is that either Trump or Cruz is that nominee.\" Buelter doesn't \"know what to expect\" at the either the Texas or national Republican conventions. \"As long as the Republican establishment doesn't try to impose its will outside what voters want, things will be OK,\" he says. But if, for example, Trump wins the popular vote and is denied the nomination, \"there's no doubt there will be rebellion, because Republicans don't want another moderate like McCain or Romney. I don't know if the Republican Party will continue to exist in the form that they are now.\" Key to mobilizing white voters is the issue of immigration, an issue Cruz and, especially, Trump have used to great effect among Republicans in Goliad and beyond. \"Trump's message on immigration was received really well here,\" says the former Minuteman Buetler. \"A lot of the [immigration] enforcement around here is local enforcement from citizens in the area calling the sheriff's department. So, the idea of a wall appeals to people, even though the idea of a wall is not feasible on a good portion of the Rio Grande River.\" Trump's wall idea, as well as his overall candidacy, is also not very feasible for a Texas and national Republican Party that will need Latino votes to be viable in 2016 and beyond, says Lydia Camarillo, vice president of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), the largest nonprofit Latino voter-registration organization. \"We will see a 'Trump effect' among Latinos everywhere, if he is the candidate,\" says Camarillo. Trump, she adds, appeals to the siege mentality taking hold in white South Texas, a South Texas where the conditions for an electoral Alamo are already in place. \"In El Paso, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, throughout the Valley, most of the competition is primarily between Latino and Latino.\" The attempts to water down and suppress the Latino vote-challenging one person, one vote; instituting voter ID laws; etc.-are the political walls of the new Goliad, the new Alamo, walls that will crumble, according to Camarillo. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email \"When Latinos reach over 30 percent of the vote, Texas will turn Democrat. It's only a matter of time,\" insists Camarillo, a native of El Paso. The question is, she says, \"when and how will we get there?\" Camarillo and other students of the Latino vote in Texas often compare Latino electoral dynamics in Texas, home to the second-largest Latino electorate, to those of California, the largest. Latino voting power is transforming politics in California, thanks, in no small part, to the \"Pete Wilson effect.\" Named for former California Governor Pete Wilson, who, like Trump, used fear of Latinos and Latino immigration in his presidential bid, the Pete Wilson effect energized Latinos who wield enormous influence in the state legislature and are a central part of the political mix that may make it impossible for Republicans to hold statewide office there in the foreseeable future. But the Texas-California comparison has its limits. Unlike California, where labor unions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, and other institutions invested heavily in the Latino vote, says Camarillo, the Democratic Party and its allied institutions \"do not really invest in Texas because of the myth that Latinos don't vote.\" Several factors-mobility, youth (the median Latino age is 22), high poverty rates-require investment in registering and then mobilizing voters, as happened in California. The lack of a similar investment in Texas was clear in the 2014 gubernatorial race, says Camarillo. \"Wendy Davis [the Democratic gubernatorial candidate] had a confused Latino message and lost by over a million votes. People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010. These results also give credence to the idea that Texas has been a kind of Republican Latino vote laboratory, ever since Leonel Sosa, advertising executive and former consultant on Latino issues to Ronald Reagan, and Karl Rove developed strategies to drive Latino support for George W. Bush up to somewhere between 40 to 44 percent (the exact number is still debated). But, says Camarillo, the combination of the Trump effect and major investments in mobilizing the Latino electorate will turn Texas blue. \"Just look at Arizona,\" she says. \"Investments in Latino voters and the [anti-immigrant Sheriff] Arpaio effect increased Latino voters from 250,000 to 750,000, in less than 4 years.\" Lacking this kind of investment, the Latino vote in Texas will continue orbiting around the 2.5 million it has in previous presidential cycles, despite continued increases in Latino voter registration, says Camarillo. \"At the current rate of investment, it will take 20 years to turn Texas blue\" she says. \"But if the Democrats and their allies invest even $25-30 million, Texas will turn blue in five years. It's really astonishing what the Democrats don't invest.\" Lacking this investment, the politics fueling the siege mentality surrounding the walls of Goliad will continue to carry the day.\n\n\"I've done it so many times, I sometimes get numb,\" says Dominguez, while standing under a large cotton tent with other men cleaning their guns, on a large field in Goliad. It's a small town in south Texas, a land where most census tracts are over 90 percent Tejano, or US-born Texans of Mexican descent. \"The first time I shot them, I felt a lot of empathy. My heart still goes out to these guys because they're unarmed.\" Related Article America's Changing Racial Makeup Won't Magically Save the Democratic Party Julianne Hing Despite his reservations, Dominguez, a 34-year-old Tejano who is a newspaper delivery coordinator from San Antonio, marched with his fellow shooters alongside the troop of white men, helped line the men up, and then shot them. Most of the hundreds of spectators gathered to see the mock execution are white, with some Tejanos mixed in. Several in the audience cry; and still others yell, \"Nooooo!\" and boo loudly. Dominguez acknowledges their feelings, but holds his political ground in his role as a cazadero-a scout and sharpshooter in the Mexican army that fought in the March 1863 Battle of Coleto Creek. He is one of hundreds of volunteers who pay thousands of dollars for the uniforms, guns, tents, and other paraphernalia they use during this annual reenactment of the \"Massacre at Goliad.\" Now in its 31st year, the reenactment of the battle, and the executions Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ordered after the battle, recalls the fighting and settlement that led to Texas's independence from Mexico. \"It was common practice to execute people,\" says Dominguez. \"The Americans were deemed pirates, which meant they were bearing arms against a government and not fighting with official flag, kind of like what we call terrorists today.\" Dominguez's comments inspire his colleague, William Bennett, a 67-year-old native of the Houston suburb Katy, to lead the conversation into the political battles raging in the Texas present. \"If Donald Trump were alive at the time of the Goliad massacre, he'd have been on the Mexican side,\" says Bennett, referring to how mixed both sides were in terms of nationality and ethnic and racial identity. Speaking for the Mexican army of 1836, he explains, \"We were protecting our country, our borders from foreigners. These foreigners want the same equal rights as Mexican citizens, but they don't pay taxes, they don't learn our language-Spanish-they don't become Catholics. They came here to steal land.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Bennett, in his real life role as Texas voter, says he likes Trump because \"he's against the establishment.\" Dominguez, who prefers Texas Senator Ted Cruz, says he will vote Trump if he wins the nomination. Neither man would, in Dominguez's terms, \"ever vote for Hillary Clinton.\" Like most of their peers in the reenactment, both Bennett and Dominguez have studied Texas history closely. Both believe early-19th-century culture and politics made Texas very dynamic, a place where the shifting sands of political identity rendered attempts to institute political and physical borders here futile, something the insurgent campaigns of Trump, Cruz, and Bernie Sanders indicate is happening again. Deep-rooted dynamics among and between whites and Latinos in Texas, a state with a whopping 38 electoral votes, continue playing a critical role in the future of Texas and presidential elections. And things will only keep being unpredictable, even zany as Texas inches towards becoming, like the other western Latino behemoth of California, another Latino-majority state. This is the context for the state's conflicts, and conflicting developments: This week's unanimous Supreme Court decision sustaining a Texas-based challenge to the one-person-one-vote principle dealt a setback to anti-Latino forces who hoped to redraw legislative districts based on eligible voters instead of total population (79 percent of Texas's whites are eligible to vote, but only 46 percent of Latinos); polls showing that immigration and border security are, respectively, the number-one and -two issues for Texas voters, but with Latinos and whites having very clear divisions on these issues. Texas has 2.2 million registered Latino voters and another 2.6 million who are eligible, but not registered, and they will eventually turn over the political tortilla in Texas. But, then, Texas being Texas, 48 percent of these Latinos gave their vote to Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2014, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino voters. * * * Taking tickets in front of the defensive stone walls at the entrance to Presidio de la Bahia (the former Spanish and Mexican fort that became Fort Goliad), Kenneth Buelter described the new political walls here and across the country. \"The new voters that you're seeing in all these primaries are part of the 80 percent that has felt like everything revolves around minorities-whether LGBT, whether immigrants, whatever portion is smallest-everything revolves around them. A lot of these voters that Trump is bringing out are people who don't feel like they've had a voice until now.\" As county chair of the Republican Party, Buelter's job is to find that voice and amplify what it's saying. Until the year 2000, it was often the voice of Democrats working in cattle, oil, and tourism industries. The resentment that followed the decline of these industries opened spaces for Republicans like Buetler, the former chapter president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, to snatch all of the countywide seats and half of the local seats. As of the Republican primary last march, Goliad and Texas became \"Cruz country,\" says Buetler, who sees the potential for \"rebellion\" at the Texas convention, whose 9,000 delegates make the event the \"the biggest convention of Republicans in the world.\" It will also be possibly the biggest Republican slugfest in the world, says Buetler. \"The Texas state convention is going to have a large Trump faction and a large Cruz faction,\" says Buetler. The high-profile personal attacks of both candidates, Buetler admits, have damaged the party overall, but he adds, \"The only chance the party has of electing someone is that either Trump or Cruz is that nominee.\" Buelter doesn't \"know what to expect\" at the either the Texas or national Republican conventions. \"As long as the Republican establishment doesn't try to impose its will outside what voters want, things will be OK,\" he says. But if, for example, Trump wins the popular vote and is denied the nomination, \"there's no doubt there will be rebellion, because Republicans don't want another moderate like McCain or Romney. I don't know if the Republican Party will continue to exist in the form that they are now.\" Key to mobilizing white voters is the issue of immigration, an issue Cruz and, especially, Trump have used to great effect among Republicans in Goliad and beyond. \"Trump's message on immigration was received really well here,\" says the former Minuteman Buetler. \"A lot of the [immigration] enforcement around here is local enforcement from citizens in the area calling the sheriff's department. So, the idea of a wall appeals to people, even though the idea of a wall is not feasible on a good portion of the Rio Grande River.\" Trump's wall idea, as well as his overall candidacy, is also not very feasible for a Texas and national Republican Party that will need Latino votes to be viable in 2016 and beyond, says Lydia Camarillo, vice president of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), the largest nonprofit Latino voter-registration organization. \"We will see a 'Trump effect' among Latinos everywhere, if he is the candidate,\" says Camarillo. Trump, she adds, appeals to the siege mentality taking hold in white South Texas, a South Texas where the conditions for an electoral Alamo are already in place. \"In El Paso, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, throughout the Valley, most of the competition is primarily between Latino and Latino.\" The attempts to water down and suppress the Latino vote-challenging one person, one vote; instituting voter ID laws; etc.-are the political walls of the new Goliad, the new Alamo, walls that will crumble, according to Camarillo.

It's only a matter of time,\" insists Camarillo, a native of El Paso. The question is, she says, \"when and how will we get there?\" Camarillo and other students of the Latino vote in Texas often compare Latino electoral dynamics in Texas, home to the second-largest Latino electorate, to those of California, the largest. Latino voting power is transforming politics in California, thanks, in no small part, to the \"Pete Wilson effect.\" Named for former California Governor Pete Wilson, who, like Trump, used fear of Latinos and Latino immigration in his presidential bid, the Pete Wilson effect energized Latinos who wield enormous influence in the state legislature and are a central part of the political mix that may make it impossible for Republicans to hold statewide office there in the foreseeable future. But the Texas-California comparison has its limits. Unlike California, where labor unions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, and other institutions invested heavily in the Latino vote, says Camarillo, the Democratic Party and its allied institutions \"do not really invest in Texas because of the myth that Latinos don't vote.\" Several factors-mobility, youth (the median Latino age is 22), high poverty rates-require investment in registering and then mobilizing voters, as happened in California. The lack of a similar investment in Texas was clear in the 2014 gubernatorial race, says Camarillo. \"Wendy Davis [the Democratic gubernatorial candidate] had a confused Latino message and lost by over a million votes. People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010.

But, says Camarillo, the combination of the Trump effect and major investments in mobilizing the Latino electorate will turn Texas blue. \"Just look at Arizona,\" she says. \"Investments in Latino voters and the [anti-immigrant Sheriff] Arpaio effect increased Latino voters from 250,000 to 750,000, in less than 4 years.\" Lacking this kind of investment, the Latino vote in Texas will continue orbiting around the 2.5 million it has in previous presidential cycles, despite continued increases in Latino voter registration, says Camarillo. \"At the current rate of investment, it will take 20 years to turn Texas blue\" she says. \"But if the Democrats and their allies invest even $25-30 million, Texas will turn blue in five years. It's really astonishing what the Democrats don't invest.\" Lacking this investment, the politics fueling the siege mentality surrounding the walls of Goliad will continue to carry the day.\n\nDominguez acknowledges their feelings, but holds his political ground in his role as a cazadero-a scout and sharpshooter in the Mexican army that fought in the March 1863 Battle of Coleto Creek. He is one of hundreds of volunteers who pay thousands of dollars for the uniforms, guns, tents, and other paraphernalia they use during this annual reenactment of the \"Massacre at Goliad.\" Now in its 31st year, the reenactment of the battle, and the executions Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ordered after the battle, recalls the fighting and settlement that led to Texas's independence from Mexico. \"It was common practice to execute people,\" says Dominguez. \"The Americans were deemed pirates, which meant they were bearing arms against a government and not fighting with official flag, kind of like what we call terrorists today.\" Dominguez's comments inspire his colleague, William Bennett, a 67-year-old native of the Houston suburb Katy, to lead the conversation into the political battles raging in the Texas present. \"If Donald Trump were alive at the time of the Goliad massacre, he'd have been on the Mexican side,\" says Bennett, referring to how mixed both sides were in terms of nationality and ethnic and racial identity. Speaking for the Mexican army of 1836, he explains, \"We were protecting our country, our borders from foreigners. These foreigners want the same equal rights as Mexican citizens, but they don't pay taxes, they don't learn our language-Spanish-they don't become Catholics. They came here to steal land.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Bennett, in his real life role as Texas voter, says he likes Trump because \"he's against the establishment.\" Dominguez, who prefers Texas Senator Ted Cruz, says he will vote Trump if he wins the nomination. Neither man would, in Dominguez's terms, \"ever vote for Hillary Clinton.\" Like most of their peers in the reenactment, both Bennett and Dominguez have studied Texas history closely. Both believe early-19th-century culture and politics made Texas very dynamic, a place where the shifting sands of political identity rendered attempts to institute political and physical borders here futile, something the insurgent campaigns of Trump, Cruz, and Bernie Sanders indicate is happening again. Deep-rooted dynamics among and between whites and Latinos in Texas, a state with a whopping 38 electoral votes, continue playing a critical role in the future of Texas and presidential elections. And things will only keep being unpredictable, even zany as Texas inches towards becoming, like the other western Latino behemoth of California, another Latino-majority state. This is the context for the state's conflicts, and conflicting developments: This week's unanimous Supreme Court decision sustaining a Texas-based challenge to the one-person-one-vote principle dealt a setback to anti-Latino forces who hoped to redraw legislative districts based on eligible voters instead of total population (79 percent of Texas's whites are eligible to vote, but only 46 percent of Latinos); polls showing that immigration and border security are, respectively, the number-one and -two issues for Texas voters, but with Latinos and whites having very clear divisions on these issues. Texas has 2.2 million registered Latino voters and another 2.6 million who are eligible, but not registered, and they will eventually turn over the political tortilla in Texas. But, then, Texas being Texas, 48 percent of these Latinos gave their vote to Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2014, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino voters. * * * Taking tickets in front of the defensive stone walls at the entrance to Presidio de la Bahia (the former Spanish and Mexican fort that became Fort Goliad), Kenneth Buelter described the new political walls here and across the country. \"The new voters that you're seeing in all these primaries are part of the 80 percent that has felt like everything revolves around minorities-whether LGBT, whether immigrants, whatever portion is smallest-everything revolves around them. A lot of these voters that Trump is bringing out are people who don't feel like they've had a voice until now.\" As county chair of the Republican Party, Buelter's job is to find that voice and amplify what it's saying. Until the year 2000, it was often the voice of Democrats working in cattle, oil, and tourism industries. The resentment that followed the decline of these industries opened spaces for Republicans like Buetler, the former chapter president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, to snatch all of the countywide seats and half of the local seats. As of the Republican primary last march, Goliad and Texas became \"Cruz country,\" says Buetler, who sees the potential for \"rebellion\" at the Texas convention, whose 9,000 delegates make the event the \"the biggest convention of Republicans in the world.\" It will also be possibly the biggest Republican slugfest in the world, says Buetler. \"The Texas state convention is going to have a large Trump faction and a large Cruz faction,\" says Buetler. The high-profile personal attacks of both candidates, Buetler admits, have damaged the party overall, but he adds, \"The only chance the party has of electing someone is that either Trump or Cruz is that nominee.\" Buelter doesn't \"know what to expect\" at the either the Texas or national Republican conventions. \"As long as the Republican establishment doesn't try to impose its will outside what voters want, things will be OK,\" he says. But if, for example, Trump wins the popular vote and is denied the nomination, \"there's no doubt there will be rebellion, because Republicans don't want another moderate like McCain or Romney. I don't know if the Republican Party will continue to exist in the form that they are now.\" Key to mobilizing white voters is the issue of immigration, an issue Cruz and, especially, Trump have used to great effect among Republicans in Goliad and beyond. \"Trump's message on immigration was received really well here,\" says the former Minuteman Buetler. \"A lot of the [immigration] enforcement around here is local enforcement from citizens in the area calling the sheriff's department. So, the idea of a wall appeals to people, even though the idea of a wall is not feasible on a good portion of the Rio Grande River.\" Trump's wall idea, as well as his overall candidacy, is also not very feasible for a Texas and national Republican Party that will need Latino votes to be viable in 2016 and beyond, says Lydia Camarillo, vice president of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), the largest nonprofit Latino voter-registration organization. \"We will see a 'Trump effect' among Latinos everywhere, if he is the candidate,\" says Camarillo. Trump, she adds, appeals to the siege mentality taking hold in white South Texas, a South Texas where the conditions for an electoral Alamo are already in place. \"In El Paso, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, throughout the Valley, most of the competition is primarily between Latino and Latino.\" The attempts to water down and suppress the Latino vote-challenging one person, one vote; instituting voter ID laws; etc.-are the political walls of the new Goliad, the new Alamo, walls that will crumble, according to Camarillo.

It's only a matter of time,\" insists Camarillo, a native of El Paso. The question is, she says, \"when and how will we get there?\" Camarillo and other students of the Latino vote in Texas often compare Latino electoral dynamics in Texas, home to the second-largest Latino electorate, to those of California, the largest. Latino voting power is transforming politics in California, thanks, in no small part, to the \"Pete Wilson effect.\" Named for former California Governor Pete Wilson, who, like Trump, used fear of Latinos and Latino immigration in his presidential bid, the Pete Wilson effect energized Latinos who wield enormous influence in the state legislature and are a central part of the political mix that may make it impossible for Republicans to hold statewide office there in the foreseeable future. But the Texas-California comparison has its limits. Unlike California, where labor unions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, and other institutions invested heavily in the Latino vote, says Camarillo, the Democratic Party and its allied institutions \"do not really invest in Texas because of the myth that Latinos don't vote.\" Several factors-mobility, youth (the median Latino age is 22), high poverty rates-require investment in registering and then mobilizing voters, as happened in California. The lack of a similar investment in Texas was clear in the 2014 gubernatorial race, says Camarillo. \"Wendy Davis [the Democratic gubernatorial candidate] had a confused Latino message and lost by over a million votes. People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010.

But, then, Texas being Texas, 48 percent of these Latinos gave their vote to Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2014, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino voters. * * * Taking tickets in front of the defensive stone walls at the entrance to Presidio de la Bahia (the former Spanish and Mexican fort that became Fort Goliad), Kenneth Buelter described the new political walls here and across the country. \"The new voters that you're seeing in all these primaries are part of the 80 percent that has felt like everything revolves around minorities-whether LGBT, whether immigrants, whatever portion is smallest-everything revolves around them. A lot of these voters that Trump is bringing out are people who don't feel like they've had a voice until now.\" As county chair of the Republican Party, Buelter's job is to find that voice and amplify what it's saying. Until the year 2000, it was often the voice of Democrats working in cattle, oil, and tourism industries. The resentment that followed the decline of these industries opened spaces for Republicans like Buetler, the former chapter president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, to snatch all of the countywide seats and half of the local seats. As of the Republican primary last march, Goliad and Texas became \"Cruz country,\" says Buetler, who sees the potential for \"rebellion\" at the Texas convention, whose 9,000 delegates make the event the \"the biggest convention of Republicans in the world.\" It will also be possibly the biggest Republican slugfest in the world, says Buetler. \"The Texas state convention is going to have a large Trump faction and a large Cruz faction,\" says Buetler. The high-profile personal attacks of both candidates, Buetler admits, have damaged the party overall, but he adds, \"The only chance the party has of electing someone is that either Trump or Cruz is that nominee.\" Buelter doesn't \"know what to expect\" at the either the Texas or national Republican conventions. \"As long as the Republican establishment doesn't try to impose its will outside what voters want, things will be OK,\" he says. But if, for example, Trump wins the popular vote and is denied the nomination, \"there's no doubt there will be rebellion, because Republicans don't want another moderate like McCain or Romney. I don't know if the Republican Party will continue to exist in the form that they are now.\" Key to mobilizing white voters is the issue of immigration, an issue Cruz and, especially, Trump have used to great effect among Republicans in Goliad and beyond. \"Trump's message on immigration was received really well here,\" says the former Minuteman Buetler. \"A lot of the [immigration] enforcement around here is local enforcement from citizens in the area calling the sheriff's department. So, the idea of a wall appeals to people, even though the idea of a wall is not feasible on a good portion of the Rio Grande River.\" Trump's wall idea, as well as his overall candidacy, is also not very feasible for a Texas and national Republican Party that will need Latino votes to be viable in 2016 and beyond, says Lydia Camarillo, vice president of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), the largest nonprofit Latino voter-registration organization. \"We will see a 'Trump effect' among Latinos everywhere, if he is the candidate,\" says Camarillo. Trump, she adds, appeals to the siege mentality taking hold in white South Texas, a South Texas where the conditions for an electoral Alamo are already in place. \"In El Paso, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, throughout the Valley, most of the competition is primarily between Latino and Latino.\" The attempts to water down and suppress the Latino vote-challenging one person, one vote; instituting voter ID laws; etc.-are the political walls of the new Goliad, the new Alamo, walls that will crumble, according to Camarillo.

It's only a matter of time,\" insists Camarillo, a native of El Paso. The question is, she says, \"when and how will we get there?\" Camarillo and other students of the Latino vote in Texas often compare Latino electoral dynamics in Texas, home to the second-largest Latino electorate, to those of California, the largest. Latino voting power is transforming politics in California, thanks, in no small part, to the \"Pete Wilson effect.\" Named for former California Governor Pete Wilson, who, like Trump, used fear of Latinos and Latino immigration in his presidential bid, the Pete Wilson effect energized Latinos who wield enormous influence in the state legislature and are a central part of the political mix that may make it impossible for Republicans to hold statewide office there in the foreseeable future. But the Texas-California comparison has its limits. Unlike California, where labor unions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, and other institutions invested heavily in the Latino vote, says Camarillo, the Democratic Party and its allied institutions \"do not really invest in Texas because of the myth that Latinos don't vote.\" Several factors-mobility, youth (the median Latino age is 22), high poverty rates-require investment in registering and then mobilizing voters, as happened in California. The lack of a similar investment in Texas was clear in the 2014 gubernatorial race, says Camarillo. \"Wendy Davis [the Democratic gubernatorial candidate] had a confused Latino message and lost by over a million votes. People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010. These results also give credence to the idea that Texas has been a kind of Republican Latino vote laboratory, ever since Leonel Sosa, advertising executive and former consultant on Latino issues to Ronald Reagan, and Karl Rove developed strategies to drive Latino support for George W. Bush up to somewhere between 40 to 44 percent (the exact number is still debated). But, says Camarillo, the combination of the Trump effect and major investments in mobilizing the Latino electorate will turn Texas blue. \"Just look at Arizona,\" she says. \"Investments in Latino voters and the [anti-immigrant Sheriff] Arpaio effect increased Latino voters from 250,000 to 750,000, in less than 4 years.\" Lacking this kind of investment, the Latino vote in Texas will continue orbiting around the 2.5 million it has in previous presidential cycles, despite continued increases in Latino voter registration, says Camarillo. \"At the current rate of investment, it will take 20 years to turn Texas blue\" she says. \"But if the Democrats and their allies invest even $25-30 million, Texas will turn blue in five years. It's really astonishing what the Democrats don't invest.\" Lacking this investment, the politics fueling the siege mentality surrounding the walls of Goliad will continue to carry the day.\n\nLike most of their peers in the reenactment, both Bennett and Dominguez have studied Texas history closely. Both believe early-19th-century culture and politics made Texas very dynamic, a place where the shifting sands of political identity rendered attempts to institute political and physical borders here futile, something the insurgent campaigns of Trump, Cruz, and Bernie Sanders indicate is happening again. Deep-rooted dynamics among and between whites and Latinos in Texas, a state with a whopping 38 electoral votes, continue playing a critical role in the future of Texas and presidential elections. And things will only keep being unpredictable, even zany as Texas inches towards becoming, like the other western Latino behemoth of California, another Latino-majority state.

But, says Camarillo, the combination of the Trump effect and major investments in mobilizing the Latino electorate will turn Texas blue. \"Just look at Arizona,\" she says. \"Investments in Latino voters and the [anti-immigrant Sheriff] Arpaio effect increased Latino voters from 250,000 to 750,000, in less than 4 years.\" Lacking this kind of investment, the Latino vote in Texas will continue orbiting around the 2.5 million it has in previous presidential cycles, despite continued increases in Latino voter registration, says Camarillo. \"At the current rate of investment, it will take 20 years to turn Texas blue\" she says. \"But if the Democrats and their allies invest even $25-30 million, Texas will turn blue in five years. It's really astonishing what the Democrats don't invest.\" Lacking this investment, the politics fueling the siege mentality surrounding the walls of Goliad will continue to carry the day.\n\nAs county chair of the Republican Party, Buelter's job is to find that voice and amplify what it's saying. Until the year 2000, it was often the voice of Democrats working in cattle, oil, and tourism industries. The resentment that followed the decline of these industries opened spaces for Republicans like Buetler, the former chapter president of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, to snatch all of the countywide seats and half of the local seats. As of the Republican primary last march, Goliad and Texas became \"Cruz country,\" says Buetler, who sees the potential for \"rebellion\" at the Texas convention, whose 9,000 delegates make the event the \"the biggest convention of Republicans in the world.\" It will also be possibly the biggest Republican slugfest in the world, says Buetler. \"The Texas state convention is going to have a large Trump faction and a large Cruz faction,\" says Buetler. The high-profile personal attacks of both candidates, Buetler admits, have damaged the party overall, but he adds, \"The only chance the party has of electing someone is that either Trump or Cruz is that nominee.\" Buelter doesn't \"know what to expect\" at the either the Texas or national Republican conventions. \"As long as the Republican establishment doesn't try to impose its will outside what voters want, things will be OK,\" he says. But if, for example, Trump wins the popular vote and is denied the nomination, \"there's no doubt there will be rebellion, because Republicans don't want another moderate like McCain or Romney. I don't know if the Republican Party will continue to exist in the form that they are now.\" Key to mobilizing white voters is the issue of immigration, an issue Cruz and, especially, Trump have used to great effect among Republicans in Goliad and beyond. \"Trump's message on immigration was received really well here,\" says the former Minuteman Buetler. \"A lot of the [immigration] enforcement around here is local enforcement from citizens in the area calling the sheriff's department. So, the idea of a wall appeals to people, even though the idea of a wall is not feasible on a good portion of the Rio Grande River.\" Trump's wall idea, as well as his overall candidacy, is also not very feasible for a Texas and national Republican Party that will need Latino votes to be viable in 2016 and beyond, says Lydia Camarillo, vice president of Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), the largest nonprofit Latino voter-registration organization. \"We will see a 'Trump effect' among Latinos everywhere, if he is the candidate,\" says Camarillo. Trump, she adds, appeals to the siege mentality taking hold in white South Texas, a South Texas where the conditions for an electoral Alamo are already in place. \"In El Paso, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, throughout the Valley, most of the competition is primarily between Latino and Latino.\" The attempts to water down and suppress the Latino vote-challenging one person, one vote; instituting voter ID laws; etc.-are the political walls of the new Goliad, the new Alamo, walls that will crumble, according to Camarillo.

It's only a matter of time,\" insists Camarillo, a native of El Paso. The question is, she says, \"when and how will we get there?\" Camarillo and other students of the Latino vote in Texas often compare Latino electoral dynamics in Texas, home to the second-largest Latino electorate, to those of California, the largest. Latino voting power is transforming politics in California, thanks, in no small part, to the \"Pete Wilson effect.\" Named for former California Governor Pete Wilson, who, like Trump, used fear of Latinos and Latino immigration in his presidential bid, the Pete Wilson effect energized Latinos who wield enormous influence in the state legislature and are a central part of the political mix that may make it impossible for Republicans to hold statewide office there in the foreseeable future. But the Texas-California comparison has its limits. Unlike California, where labor unions, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits, and other institutions invested heavily in the Latino vote, says Camarillo, the Democratic Party and its allied institutions \"do not really invest in Texas because of the myth that Latinos don't vote.\" Several factors-mobility, youth (the median Latino age is 22), high poverty rates-require investment in registering and then mobilizing voters, as happened in California. The lack of a similar investment in Texas was clear in the 2014 gubernatorial race, says Camarillo. \"Wendy Davis [the Democratic gubernatorial candidate] had a confused Latino message and lost by over a million votes. People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010. These results also give credence to the idea that Texas has been a kind of Republican Latino vote laboratory, ever since Leonel Sosa, advertising executive and former consultant on Latino issues to Ronald Reagan, and Karl Rove developed strategies to drive Latino support for George W.

People weren't excited by her candidacy.\" Her opponent, Abbott, boosted the Republican share of the Latino vote by 6 percent over what Rick Perry won in 2010. These results also give credence to the idea that Texas has been a kind of Republican Latino vote laboratory, ever since Leonel Sosa, advertising executive and former consultant on Latino issues to Ronald Reagan, and Karl Rove developed strategies to drive Latino support for George W. Bush up to somewhere between 40 to 44 percent (the exact number is still debated). But, says Camarillo, the combination of the Trump effect and major investments in mobilizing the Latino electorate will turn Texas blue. \"Just look at Arizona,\" she says. \"Investments in Latino voters and the [anti-immigrant Sheriff] Arpaio effect increased Latino voters from 250,000 to 750,000, in less than 4 years.\" Lacking this kind of investment, the Latino vote in Texas will continue orbiting around the 2.5 million it has in previous presidential cycles, despite continued increases in Latino voter registration, says Camarillo. \"At the current rate of investment, it will take 20 years to turn Texas blue\" she says. \"But if the Democrats and their allies invest even $25-30 million, Texas will turn blue in five years. It's really astonishing what the Democrats don't invest.\" Lacking this investment, the politics fueling the siege mentality surrounding the walls of Goliad will continue to carry the day.\n\nThese results also give credence to the idea that Texas has been a kind of Republican Latino vote laboratory, ever since Leonel Sosa, advertising executive and former consultant on Latino issues to Ronald Reagan, and Karl Rove developed strategies to drive Latino support for George W.

But while comprehensive immigration reform is a continual concern for many in the Latino community, Obama will have to go beyond that issue to also focus on improving schools and creating jobs if he wants to attract a wide spectrum of Latino voters.

By picking California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to fill Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, Governor Gavin Newsom met both goals. Padilla, the working-class son of Mexican immigrants, will become the first Latino senator from California, a state that is roughly 40 percent Latino. Watch this , and then try to argue Newsom made a bad pick. It's tough. Still, it's also tough to see the Senate lose one of only 17 female Democratic senators-and its only Black woman. Californians have been represented by two women in the Senate for nearly 30 years, and with Senator Dianne Feinstein's increasing challenges, politically and otherwise, it's hard not to wish Newsom had been able to keep it that way. He had an almost impossible job. A Latina Democrat would have been a perfect choice, but as evidence of the barriers they face, there are none in statewide roles and few in Congress in California. A coalition of 100-plus women connected with Black Women United urged the governor to pick either Representative Barbara Lee of Oakland or Representative Karen Bass of Los Angeles, two choices that would have pleased progressives too. Some progressives also pushed for Orange County Representative Katie Porter, who is white. But Newsom probably had to worry about removing another member of Nancy Pelosi's shrinking House majority, at least until special elections, and Porter's seat is purplish, not necessarily solid blue.

She later amplified: \"I am both disappointed having no Black women in the US Senate and happy for Alex Padilla who will no doubt serve my home state of California well. There is also a larger issue of structural, cultural and political barriers that create fewer opportunities for leaders of color to move up.\" Higher Heights cofounder Glynda Carr, who worked with Finney and others to push Harris last summer, shared her disappointment. \"We made a major step forward with the election of Kamala Harris. This appointment is a giant step backward,\" she told me. \"So today we double down and accelerate the work to expand the number of women and elect Black women to the US Senate.\" Indeed.

(AP / Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nA group of young soccer players loaded into two vans on a sunny fall day in 2018, and made their way from their hotel to a nearby sports complex in Ontario, California. The preparations to welcome the 36 potential stars were in place: a trailer for staff and volunteers; tents for coaches, scouts, and club representatives; and designated sections for medical staff and family members. On the sidelines, a camera was ready to record the exhibition game, where the players would compete to gain the attention of scouts. There was even a balloon arch for them to walk under as they stepped onto the pitch. This story was reported in partnership with Type Investigations , where Isma'il Kushkush is an Ida B. Wells Fellow. The players were mostly US-born Latinos in their late teens, and they traveled-all expenses paid-from nearly a dozen US states. They began to stretch and warm up: jogging, passing to each other, and taking shots on goal. When they were done, Rafa Calderon, a staff member with Alianza de Futbol, the group organizing the five-day soccer showcase, called them together. \"This is your time, enjoy it!\" he told them. \"You are here because you belong here. You earned it.\" The players stepped off the field. Then, along with their opponents from the youth development academy Real So Cal, they walked in parallel lines under the balloons back to the center of the field, where they shook hands with the referees and kicked off the match. Among those watching were representatives from 13 clubs in the Liga MX, Mexico's professional soccer league, and two from the Mexican Football Federation (FMF), the sport's governing body in Mexico. \"Within the first day, I've already identified three players [who] are really interesting,\" said José Luis Real, the sports development and youth academy director of the Mexican soccer club Toluca and a former Mexican national team coach. \"As of yesterday, I could have booked a flight back home and considered my job done.\" Related Article Soccer and Domestic Violence: When the Beautiful Game Turns Ugly Miguel Salazar Mexican clubs and even the Mexican men's national team have routinely recruited players promoted by Alianza de Futbol, a San Francisco Bay Area-based organization dedicated to the development of Hispanic amateur soccer. They include Edwin Lara, a US-born player who played for Mexico's under-17 Mexican national team (before later making a nationality switch to the US team), and Jonathan Gonzalez, another Mexican-American player who was recruited by the Liga MX club Monterrey and played for the US men's U-15 team. US Soccer Hall of Famer Hugo Pérez watched the players intently from the sidelines. He was impressed. There players \"have good qualities and potential to play at a higher level,\" Pérez told me. \"Alianza is the best organization in the country for helping all the soccer communities, especially the Latinos.\" Current Issue View our current issue And for the second time in the national showcase's six-year history, the US Soccer Federation-known simply as US Soccer, the country's official governing body-sent scouts, according to Alianza. \"The history was that there's been very little communication. I would call once or twice a year just to remind them that we're out here,\" said Brad Rothenberg, an Alianza de Futbol cofounder.

Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players.

According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed.

One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nThis story was reported in partnership with Type Investigations , where Isma'il Kushkush is an Ida B. Wells Fellow.\n\nThe players were mostly US-born Latinos in their late teens, and they traveled-all expenses paid-from nearly a dozen US states. They began to stretch and warm up: jogging, passing to each other, and taking shots on goal. When they were done, Rafa Calderon, a staff member with Alianza de Futbol, the group organizing the five-day soccer showcase, called them together. \"This is your time, enjoy it!\" he told them. \"You are here because you belong here. You earned it.\" The players stepped off the field. Then, along with their opponents from the youth development academy Real So Cal, they walked in parallel lines under the balloons back to the center of the field, where they shook hands with the referees and kicked off the match. Among those watching were representatives from 13 clubs in the Liga MX, Mexico's professional soccer league, and two from the Mexican Football Federation (FMF), the sport's governing body in Mexico. \"Within the first day, I've already identified three players [who] are really interesting,\" said José Luis Real, the sports development and youth academy director of the Mexican soccer club Toluca and a former Mexican national team coach. \"As of yesterday, I could have booked a flight back home and considered my job done.\" Related Article Soccer and Domestic Violence: When the Beautiful Game Turns Ugly Miguel Salazar Mexican clubs and even the Mexican men's national team have routinely recruited players promoted by Alianza de Futbol, a San Francisco Bay Area-based organization dedicated to the development of Hispanic amateur soccer. They include Edwin Lara, a US-born player who played for Mexico's under-17 Mexican national team (before later making a nationality switch to the US team), and Jonathan Gonzalez, another Mexican-American player who was recruited by the Liga MX club Monterrey and played for the US men's U-15 team. US Soccer Hall of Famer Hugo Pérez watched the players intently from the sidelines. He was impressed.

This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nThe players stepped off the field. Then, along with their opponents from the youth development academy Real So Cal, they walked in parallel lines under the balloons back to the center of the field, where they shook hands with the referees and kicked off the match. Among those watching were representatives from 13 clubs in the Liga MX, Mexico's professional soccer league, and two from the Mexican Football Federation (FMF), the sport's governing body in Mexico. \"Within the first day, I've already identified three players [who] are really interesting,\" said José Luis Real, the sports development and youth academy director of the Mexican soccer club Toluca and a former Mexican national team coach. \"As of yesterday, I could have booked a flight back home and considered my job done.\" Related Article Soccer and Domestic Violence: When the Beautiful Game Turns Ugly Miguel Salazar Mexican clubs and even the Mexican men's national team have routinely recruited players promoted by Alianza de Futbol, a San Francisco Bay Area-based organization dedicated to the development of Hispanic amateur soccer. They include Edwin Lara, a US-born player who played for Mexico's under-17 Mexican national team (before later making a nationality switch to the US team), and Jonathan Gonzalez, another Mexican-American player who was recruited by the Liga MX club Monterrey and played for the US men's U-15 team. US Soccer Hall of Famer Hugo Pérez watched the players intently from the sidelines. He was impressed. There players \"have good qualities and potential to play at a higher level,\" Pérez told me. \"Alianza is the best organization in the country for helping all the soccer communities, especially the Latinos.\" Current Issue View our current issue And for the second time in the national showcase's six-year history, the US Soccer Federation-known simply as US Soccer, the country's official governing body-sent scouts, according to Alianza. \"The history was that there's been very little communication.

US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg.

US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg. But until last year it had never sent anyone in an official capacity to the marquee showcase. \"There's never been a real concerted interest,\" he said. Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me.

US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg. But until last year it had never sent anyone in an official capacity to the marquee showcase. \"There's never been a real concerted interest,\" he said. Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported.

Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players.

According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said.

One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nMiguel Salazar\n\nMexican clubs and even the Mexican men's national team have routinely recruited players promoted by Alianza de Futbol, a San Francisco Bay Area-based organization dedicated to the development of Hispanic amateur soccer. They include Edwin Lara, a US-born player who played for Mexico's under-17 Mexican national team (before later making a nationality switch to the US team), and Jonathan Gonzalez, another Mexican-American player who was recruited by the Liga MX club Monterrey and played for the US men's U-15 team. US Soccer Hall of Famer Hugo Pérez watched the players intently from the sidelines. He was impressed. There players \"have good qualities and potential to play at a higher level,\" Pérez told me. \"Alianza is the best organization in the country for helping all the soccer communities, especially the Latinos.\" Current Issue View our current issue And for the second time in the national showcase's six-year history, the US Soccer Federation-known simply as US Soccer, the country's official governing body-sent scouts, according to Alianza. \"The history was that there's been very little communication.

Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nUS Soccer Hall of Famer Hugo Pérez watched the players intently from the sidelines. He was impressed. There players \"have good qualities and potential to play at a higher level,\" Pérez told me. \"Alianza is the best organization in the country for helping all the soccer communities, especially the Latinos.\" Current Issue View our current issue And for the second time in the national showcase's six-year history, the US Soccer Federation-known simply as US Soccer, the country's official governing body-sent scouts, according to Alianza. \"The history was that there's been very little communication. I would call once or twice a year just to remind them that we're out here,\" said Brad Rothenberg, an Alianza de Futbol cofounder. US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg.

US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg. But until last year it had never sent anyone in an official capacity to the marquee showcase. \"There's never been a real concerted interest,\" he said. Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play.

Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nAnd for the second time in the national showcase's six-year history, the US Soccer Federation-known simply as US Soccer, the country's official governing body-sent scouts, according to Alianza. \"The history was that there's been very little communication.

Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said.

After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nUS Soccer disputes Alianza's characterization that it has been ignoring the organization, and says they have sent personnel to various events over the years. \"The history was that there's been very little communication. I would call once or twice a year just to remind them that we're out here,\" said Brad Rothenberg, an Alianza de Futbol cofounder. US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg. But until last year it had never sent anyone in an official capacity to the marquee showcase. \"There's never been a real concerted interest,\" he said. Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed.

He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\n\"The history was that there's been very little communication. I would call once or twice a year just to remind them that we're out here,\" said Brad Rothenberg, an Alianza de Futbol cofounder. US Soccer had sent scouts to some of Alianza's local tryout events, said Rothenberg. But until last year it had never sent anyone in an official capacity to the marquee showcase. \"There's never been a real concerted interest,\" he said. Rothenberg-the son of Alan Rothenberg, who headed US Soccer in the 1990s-told me that US Soccer has ignored Hispanic players, coaches, and scouts for years, creating a diversity problem that's entrenched in the highest echelons of the sport. A 2014 study of USMNT players by journalist Roger Bennett and University of Chicago economics professor Greg Kaplan showed that US men's national team (USMNT) players from the previous two decades were more likely to come from higher-income, white families than top American basketball and football players during the same period. The study was never published, though Bennett discussed some of the findings on a podcast. The 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face.

At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nThe 2019 USMNT Gold Cup roster of 23 players included four Latino and seven black players, making the roster almost half-minority, whereas the 1994 World Cup roster of 22 players included five Latino and only two black players, according to data provided by US Soccer. While, on the surface, this signals an improvement, major talent pools from which USMNT recruits remain disproportionately white when it comes to homegrown talent. Data obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round.

It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States.

It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nData obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations from Alianza de Futbol shows that for the 2018 season only 7 percent of players in Major League Soccer are US-born Latinos and 11 percent are US-born black players. There i s a higher percentage of international players of color in the MLS, but they aren't eligible to play on the USMNT. In 2017, about 38 percent of the league's players were eligible to play for the USMNT, according to ESPN FC . \"It's an excellent exercise of improving but not getting any better,\" said Paul Gardner, a columnist at Soccer America . \"One of the reasons is that we are not using the full repertoire of talent that's available to us.\" I interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing....

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nI interviewed more than two dozen people connected with soccer in the United States, including former US Soccer officials, former USMNT players, Mexican national team coaches, US youth club coaches and staff, teenage players, and sports writers. Nearly everyone agreed: A big part of the reason the USMNT doesn't benefit from \"the full repertoire of talent,\" especially top black and Latino players, is that American soccer scouts, coaches, and officials neglect youth clubs and leagues that are not affiliated with US Soccer. Instead, USMNT recruiters focus their efforts on exclusive development academies and pay-to-play youth soccer clubs and leagues, which are more likely to have white, higher-income players. Related Article A Soccer Game Becomes an Anti-Fascist Demonstration in Portland Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff Scouts scouring the United States for talent have a difficult job: They are limited in number, and work in a continent-sized country. According to US Soccer, there are 90 part-time scouts distributed throughout the US working with boys. They report to three full-time scouts. Neil Buethe, US Soccer's chief communications officer, wrote in an e-mail that one of the full-time scouts was a native Spanish speaker of Argentine descent, and 20 of the 90 part-time scouts spoke Spanish, though he couldn't say how many were Latino. \"We typically have at least one Spanish-speaking scout in each of the major markets,\" said Buethe. He added that there were three part-time Spanish-speaking scouts each in southern California, Texas, New York/New Jersey, and Florida. Buethe did not break down the ethnicities of the on-the-ground scouts further. Critics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nCritics insist this is not enough to reach beyond the familiar networks of wealthier teams and leagues. By not hiring enough scouts from immigrant and minority communities, they say, US Soccer officials have failed to find and develop more talent from working-class communities of color. \"My feeling about the future prospects of the United States in world soccer is that it ought to be better than anybody,\" said Gardner, who has written on the neglect of Latino talent in American soccer for more than 30 years. In addition to financial resources and a large population, he explained, the United States has millions of youth who play soccer, especially in immigrant communities of color. \"The only country that comes close to us is Brazil...and the Brazilians have managed to come up with some sort of soccer that allows a place for everybody,\" he said. I n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw. One publication dubbed the match \"the worst loss in the history of US men's soccer.\" \"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said.

After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nI n October 2017, when the men's national team, ranked 28 in the world, lost to Trinidad and Tobago, ranked 99, American soccer fans were crushed. For the first time since 1986, the United States had failed to qualify for the World Cup-and all they needed was a draw.

In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\n\"In other countries, when that happens, it's [time to] clean house,\" Pérez said. After the loss to Trinidad and Tobago, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati decided he would not run for reelection. But in the first contested US Soccer presidential election in nearly two decades, US Soccer membership elected Carlos Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Gulati's vice president. US Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me.

Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nUS Soccer officials say they have long-term plans in place. Buethe wrote in an e-mail that they're \"increasing the number of scouts in our Talent Identification Department, finding more touchpoints at the grassroots levels with youth clubs, restructuring our coaching license pathway, [and] working more closely with our Member Organizations.\" Still many critics fear that US Soccer hasn't reformed. The USMNT U23 failed to qualify for two consecutive Olympic Games, in 2012 and 2016. After a loss to Mexico in this year's Gold Cup final, and with the United States cohosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the calls to transform how American soccer is managed have grown louder. Then, on October 15, the US lost 2-0 to Canada, the first time Canada had defeated the USMNT in 34 years. \"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany.

The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\n\"Failing to qualify for the World Cup is a symptom rather than the problem itself,\" said former USMNT midfielder Kyle Martino, now an NBC Sports analyst who ran against Cordeiro. \"The failure is the byproduct of a top-down strategy; it's trickle-down soccer.\" C ontrary to those that dismiss the game as un-American, soccer isn't a recent import. Working-class English, Scottish, and Irish immigrants brought the game to New England in the 1880s, and a successful professional league operated between 1921 and 1932. The United States even finished third in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The Great Depression and World War II, however, put a halt to the game's growth, and it nearly disappeared in this country outside of urban, ethnic, and immigrant communities. There was a brief revival after the 1950 World Cup, when the US national team shocked everyone by beating the favorite, England, in the first round. At this time, like in much of the rest of the world, people from all socioeconomic backgrounds mostly played soccer informally, Gregory Reck, co-author of American Soccer: History, Culture, Class , explained to me. This, he said, began to change in the late 1950s and 1960s with the rise of collegiate soccer and in the 1970s with the proliferation of expensive youth soccer programs. This is when the game became largely a middle- and upper-class sport among white Americans. \"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams.

The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

Buethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\n\"So the view that soccer is 'recent' is due to the fact that it is recent for the socioeconomic class that occupies the bulk of the [organized] soccer landscape today,\" Reck said. It also explains how most players made it to the USMNT. \"The national teams were recruited through the development pipeline: pay-to-play youth soccer, university soccer, and then pro and national team,\" Reck said. \"It limited access to those players coming from families with financial and cultural capital.\" Add to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nAdd to this that coaches from Northern Europe, especially England and Scotland, have had a tremendous influence on soccer in the United States. Traditionally, English soccer focused less on the technical skills, creativity, and imaginative play associated with Latin American soccer and more on physical strength. For decades, England-trained coaches dominated the ranks of American youth soccer, with a later influx of coaches from Germany and the Netherlands. Because Latin American players, coaches, and staff played a different style of game, the US soccer establishment never invested in developing these individuals, explained Mike Woitalla, the executive director of Soccer Americ a: \"They almost had a disdain for it.\" A s chair of US Soccer's now dormant Diversity Task Force from 2008 until 2015, Doug Andreassen saw another problem: Soccer officials, particularly those with state youth associations, failed to even recognize that anything was wrong. \"They thought if the Latinos wanted to play, if the kids that were from Nigeria wanted to play, they could play. Well, that was far from the case,\" he said. The inability to acknowledge the barriers faced by many young players of color, according to Andreassen, applies to many at the highest levels of US Soccer: \"I'm not sure anybody in US Soccer understood there was a problem either. That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

That's not to say their intentions were not good, but the intentions and understanding the issue are two different things.\" Related Article The Problem With Latinidad Miguel Salazar One hurdle, Andreassen said, is access. By the 1960s, USMNT players typically came from university soccer powerhouses like Saint Louis University and, later, the University of Virginia. More recently, most players either climbed the ladder of USMNT youth teams or were recruited from Major League Soccer or a foreign league. According to US Soccer, currently 90 percent of its youth national teams come from the US Soccer Development Academy, a league composed of youth academies and clubs from various organizations. And about 70-80 percent of those players come from the MLS academies. Most of the rest are based internationally. When asked about the demographic breakdown of male US Soccer-affiliated youth clubs, US Soccer didn't have an answer. \"For the most part, our members do not track demographics, and we do not have that information,\" wrote Buethe. The families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer.

Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nThe families of youths who play for competitive soccer clubs, explained Andreassen, pay fees that can range as high as $5,000 to $17,000 per season. At IMG Academy, whose alumni include former USMNT player Landon Donovan, it can cost nearly $80,000 a year if you're boarding. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income for Hispanics in 2018 was $51,450, well below the overall median of $63,179 and the $70,642 median for whites. That same year, the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported that only 28 percent of families involved in soccer had incomes below $50,000. More than a third of soccer families had household incomes above $100,000. There have been some remedies; for example, most MLS development academies are free, which has likely led to improvement in Latino and black player representation in USMNT youth teams. Still, the number of kids in these academies is limited. \"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\n\"They still only represent a small percentage of placement options for the huge number of youth players,\" said Rothenberg. \"At the lowest age groups, black and Latino kids are not being developed for elite competition.\" According to US Soccer's media kit, there are 3.7 million kids playing soccer today in these registered leagues. But Andreassen estimates that there are an additional 10 to 14 million kids playing in unaffiliated leagues, often denigrated as \"pirate leagues.\" (US Soccer could not speak to the accuracy of Andreassen's estimate. Buethe said US Soccer scouts have contacts in unaffiliated leagues, and that anyone can send videos to scouts through email. ) These range from teams run by a local YMCA to the numerous immigrant leagues. \"There are whole sections of our country that have leagues that are just Latino,\" Andreassen said. One problem, he said, is that US Soccer largely works through volunteers and underpaid staff. Even Andreassen's old position as chair of the Diversity Task Force was unpaid. He said that before the Diversity Task Force was put on what now appears to be a permanent hiatus, he told US Soccer leadership to \"take this out of the hands of volunteers\" and hire a permanent diversity officer like other major sports organizations. In an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nIn an e-mail, Buethe said that US Soccer hired Tonya Wallach as its \"first Chief Talent & Inclusion Officer in August 2017 to lead our Diversity & Inclusion efforts.\" Despite repeated requests, US Soccer did not make Wallach available for an interview. When asked about the Diversity Task Force, Buethe said the original Task Force, which Andreassen headed, had \"met its strategic goal.\" He also pointed to a new diversity and inclusion working group that is part of the Youth Soccer Task Force. \"They are charged with recommending and implementing practical ways to provide more opportunities for inclusion and to encourage more diversity among players, coaches, referees, and administrators,\" he explained.

US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate.

Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nBuethe said US Soccer \"acknowledged that we should have included more Latinos as part of the Youth Task Force working groups,\" adding that they are \"actively working to add additional individuals to rectify the situation.\" \"It is really stunning that this happened,\" Woitalla said. \"It also shows me how unattached the leadership is.\" A nother issue is the lack of enough Latino US Soccer-licensed coaches with the cultural competence and skills to recruit talented players of color. US Soccer did not have an answer about the backgrounds of licensed coaches. \"There is a ceiling for Latino coaches,\" Woitalla said. One obstacle, he explained, is that the required licenses to coach higher-level teams or national teams are costly and can take a long time to get. Right now, former USMNT star Tab Ramos is the only Latino coach for a USMNT youth team. A similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session.

Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nA similar problem exists in the MLS. A study by Alianza de Futbol obtained by The Nation found that for the 2018 season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams had a white head coach, with just four teams headed by Latino coaches. Looking more broadly at the technical staffs, the picture is even more stark: According to Alianza's analysis, there were only three US-born Latino and three US-born black technical staff members in the entire league. That's less than 5 percent of all MLS technical staff, which includes assistant coaches, trainers, and other coaching staff. Pérez said he believes that there are not enough decision-makers in US Soccer who are \"prepared and equipped\" to reach out to Latinos. Scouts, Pérez argues, should be familiar with the communities they target and their issues of concern. For many Latinos, that might be citizenship and residency status, as the cases of Lizandro Claros Saravia and his brother Diego illustrate. Promising teenage players from Germantown, Maryland, the Claros Saravia brothers came to the United States from El Salvador as undocumented children. One of Lizandro's former coaches at Bethesda Soccer Club, a top youth club, described him as \"one of the best [center-backs] in the country.\" In 2017 Lizandro won a soccer scholarship to play and attend Louisburg College in North Carolina. But Lizandro and Diego arrived in the country in 2009-two years too late to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), the Obama-era immigration policy that would've allowed them to receive work permits and deferments from deportation. Lizandro was originally granted a stay of removal in 2013, but it lasted only a year, and subsequent applications were denied. Though Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew he and his brother were in the country illegally, they were considered low-priority by the Obama administration because of their clean records. When Lizandro informed the authorities that he was leaving for North Carolina during a routine check in, ICE detained both Lizandro and Diego. Five days later, they were deported. It is stories like these that make many families with undocumented members hesitant to enroll their children in formal soccer programs. Former US Soccer president Alan Rothenberg said, \"When people ask me, 'When will the US win the World Cup?' I tell them, 'When we have comprehensive immigration reform.'\" P érez understands firsthand the challenges that young, talented players from immigrant communities face. He migrated to the United States from El Salvador with his family when he was 11, and got his start in the early 1980s playing in the North American Soccer League, the now defunct professional soccer league that predated Major League Soccer. He went on to play for the USMNT, and participated in the 1984 Olympics and 1994 World Cup. Pérez was a technical adviser and scout for US Soccer from 2008 to 2015, and he coached US men's youth teams from 2012 to 2014.

Dave Zirin Israel Canceled the FIFA Palestine Cup for No Apparent Reason Dave Zirin The Soccer Fans That Toppled a Government Mickaël Correia During his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end. Speaking for the first time publicly on the topic, he said he was told more than once not to speak Spanish to Latino players, and that his continued use of Spanish on the field may have contributed to him being let go. \"I did it a couple of times when I saw coaches from the opposite team so they wouldn't understand me,\" he explained. \"I felt I had the advantage if the other team didn't understand the directions I was giving.\" Pérez said the order came from the top of US Soccer. Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session.

Two sources, who asked not to be named out of fear retaliation, confirmed that Pérez spoke to them at the time about the request from US Soccer officials to not speak Spanish with players during matches or training. Pérez said he ignored the requests and that no one explained to him why there was an objection other than, \"This was a US national team.\" In fact, he said he had heard former coach Jürgen Klinsmann speak German to German-born American players during a senior USMNT training session. He said he never made an official complaint because he didn't think US Soccer \"would change their stance.\" \"Of everything that happened, that was the saddest thing.... It made me feel unappreciated.\" In an e-mailed response, Buethe denied that Pérez's usage of Spanish contributed to his termination: \"There were other factors that contributed to the decision,\" adding later, \"This was a collaborative decision within US Soccer.\" He stated that there is no policy against speaking Spanish or any other language, writing, \"at times, Youth National Team and even senior National Team coaches, will speak to players in other languages one-on-one, but the key is making sure that coaches are getting messages across to all their players in the most effective and efficient manner.\" I n 2017, when neither the USMNT U-20 nor the senior team invited Gonzalez to their camps, even though he was playing professionally, he felt snubbed. \"US Soccer was not taking me seriously,\" he told me. A year later, he made the switch and played for Mexico, utilizing the FIFA rule that allows a dual-national player to change nationality just once. \"Here we are sitting on all this talent and not using it,\" Gardner said, adding explicit language. \"That's worse than a scandal; it's an outrage.\" Some soccer analysts in America have suggested looking into the experiences of countries like France and Germany. Both national teams rebuilt their squads after episodes of failure by restructuring their scouting and youth programs to reach young talent in working-class and immigrant areas. The results have been resoundingly successful, with Germany winning the World Cup in 2014, and France in 2018. \"This should have been done 20 years ago,\" Gardner said in frustration. In the meantime, more US-born Latino players are finding their way to other countries. Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Angel Avalos-two of the most promising players who participated in Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2018-have been recruited by Mexican national youth teams. In September 2019, Pérez accepted a position as a scout for Mexico's youth teams. Pérez insisted that he holds no grudges toward US Soccer, but said it must do a better job at reaching out to underserved communities of color. The USMNT, Pérez said, can't wait for the next stars from immigrant communities to just pop up: \"US Soccer needs to go to them.\" UPDATE: The piece has been updated to reflect additional comments from US Soccer and to correct an error; in addition to 2018, US Soccer sent a scout to the Alianza showcase in 2013, according to Alianza.\n\nDave Zirin\n\nDave Zirin\n\nMickaël Correia\n\nDuring his tenure, Pérez said he presented a plan to US Soccer that sought to move away from what he described as a \"tentative style\" to a more attacking style of play. He wanted US Soccer to bring in young players from outside of the academy system and recruit talented players from immigrant leagues. To do this, every month for three years, he established free training centers to scout talent. Pérez said that when he met with players and coaches from unaffiliated leagues, \"People would say, 'Wow, we're glad you came because for years nobody has come.'\" While recognizing that there are not enough scouts, Pérez said that US Soccer has a responsibility to look outside of affiliated leagues. He also said his work as a scout was boosted by the fact that he spoke Spanish and was familiar with Latino culture. It helped him ease the concerns, answer questions, and persuade the parents of potential players to consider a future in American soccer. Among the promising players Pérez discovered was Jonathan Gonzalez of Santa Rosa, California. A local coach recommended Gonzalez, and Pérez invited the young player to one of his training sessions. \"His IQ of soccer was advanced for his age, very technical, excellent character, has excellent manners, very coachable, could play different positions,\" Pérez said. Gonzalez was born in the United States to Mexican immigrants. When he was 14, his performance at Alianza de Futbol's showcase in 2013 landed him offers to join the youth teams of 13 Liga MX teams. He would also start for a number of USMNT's youth teams coached by Pérez. In 2014, however, Pérez's work coaching the US U-15 team came to an end.

The exceptions are the \"perp walk\" images featured in local TV news outlets, usually showing \"suspected gang members\" being taken in by the police. But let's also not forget the persistent images in US films and television of Latinos as drug dealers/drug lords, or other types of criminals-on the few occasions we are able to crash the industry. The most recent research shows that Latinos make up about 4 percent of those represented in US films, TV, and commercials. It is a remarkable feat of magic to make the 62 million Latinos in this country invisible. Latinos are nearly 19 percent of the US population, accounting for 51.1 percent of the country's growth, according to the 2020 US Census. By 2060, the Latino population is projected to nearly double in size to 111.2 million people, accounting for 28 percent of the US population. The three largest US Latino population groups are Chicanos/Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans (not including those on the island), and Central Americans. These are all overwhelmingly working-class populations, and they share a tortured history with the US government: Puerto Ricans, direct US colonialism; Chicanos, US annexation of Mexico's northern territories; and Central Americans, displacement by US-supported wars or coups in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua. Other larger Latino populations from Cuba and Latin America (Venezuelans, Argentines, Chilenos) tend to be more middle- and upper-class. In an evil bit of irony, Mexicans did make the front pages of US newspapers and were often the lead in TV news shows in 2015-when Donald Trump kicked off his presidential campaign by characterizing Mexicans as \"rapists and criminals,\" and pledging to build a 2,000-mile wall along the US-Mexico border to prevent any further incursion by Mexican immigrants. Trump capped that despicable pledge by also promising to deport the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States-the overwhelming majority of whom are Latino. While the mainstream media carefully avoided the term \"ethnic cleansing,\" that is exactly what Trump was promising-to the hysterical cheers of his MAGA base, and the fired-up testosterone of the armed racist militias waving their guns at Mexicanos on the other side of the border. But other than the examples I have cited, the Latino population in this country is most often out of sight and out of mind, even in the media of the US left, which mostly continues to frame US politics within a strictly \"Black-white \"framework.

Steve Phillips Democratic Insiders Keep Bashing Progressives, but Progressives Keep Winning Key Elections John Nichols There is, however, a new exception to the ghosting of Latinos in the broader US society. And that has to do with the growing numbers and potential power of the Latino electorate. When important elections roll around, lo and behold, we are suddenly found! Since the 2020 elections, there has been a veritable deluge of articles about Latino voters. Misconceptions about Latino voters These articles fall roughly into two categories. The one that has received the most attention is the notion that Latinos are essentially a conservative population, moving toward support for the Republican Party. The rationale for this assertion is that the GOP has been able to successfully appeal to the Latino values of family, church, and patriotism. This is not a new phenomenon, but one whose history extends as far back as the Nixon administration, which undertook a lukewarm effort to seduce Latino voters with these same threadbare arguments. One unspoken assumption of this argument is that there are other communities in the US that do not value family, faith, and country-a reflection of dominant thinking about African Americans within the Republican Party, and a cheap effort to divide Latinos and African Americans.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Another set of political articles argues that \"there is nothing to worry about,\" that Latinos continue to be strong supporters of the Democratic Party and are not going anywhere. In fact, an analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute of the 2020 elections strongly supports this assertion. Most of the articles warning about a Latino defection to the Republicans rely on exit polls for their analysis. The UCLA study, however, analyzed the record of ballots cast, thereby avoiding the errors that often emerge from the small and not necessarily representative sample provided by exit polls. Exit polls also fail to take into account the impact of early and absentee voters, or possibilities of language bias. Current Issue View our current issue The UCLA study analyzed Latino voting results for the US Senate in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas. The data strongly debunks the \"Latinos are going Republican\" myth. It turns out that Latinos in those states voted overwhelmingly for Democratic Senate candidates, with no data indicating a decline in Democratic support for the Senate. Latino voters went 3-1 for the Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia, and by a 2-1 margin in New Mexico, and Texas. What may be of interest, however, is that, except for Texas, Latino voters gave more votes to the Democratic candidates than to Joe Biden. Donald Trump received 2 to 3 percent more votes in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico than did the Democratic Senate candidates. The Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia received 10 percent more Latino votes than did Biden. Only in Texas was there no significant difference among Latinos in their votes for the Democratic Senate candidate and their votes for Joseph Biden. Although not a component of the UCLA study, Latino voters in the important swing of state Nevada also voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And, of course, Latino voters provided a significant part of Biden's huge electoral victory in California. As a Colorado homeboy, I was particularly interested in how the Chicanada had voted there is 2020. There are about 323,000 Latino registered voters in Colorado, accounting for 10.4 percent of the state's registered voters. According to the UCLA study, 315,000 cast their ballots in the 2020 election, shattering the myth that Latinos never show up at the polls. Latinos in Colorado voted for Biden and the Democratic Senate candidate, John Hickenlooper, by a 3-1 margin over the Republicans, or, put another way, 73 percent voted for Biden, and 76 percent for Hickenlooper. This demonstrates a level of voter loyalty that any serious political party would die for. By the way, less than half the white voters in my home state supported either Democratic candidate. Let's also look at Georgia, with its fast-growing Latino population. Most of us know that the victories in Georgia US Senate races by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were key to the Democrats' gaining a 50-50 split in the US Senate, enabling Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes. But most people don't realize how important the Latino vote was to those victories. An estimated 178,000 Latinos in Georgia voted in the 2020 election, representing 3.6 percent of the state's electorate. But-and this is a major \"but\"-the Georgia Senate elections were decided by fewer than 12,000 votes. Latino voters voted for the Democrat senatorial candidates by a greater than 3-1 margin (75 percent and 80 percent), clearly contributing to their margin of victory; they voted 67 percent for Biden. By contrast, less than 20 percent of white voters in Georgia supported any of the three Democratic candidates. A similar picture is advanced by the UCLA study for the other states, which demonstrates that the Latino electorate remains strongly in the Democratic column. Texas, again, presents a very interesting and somewhat different picture. There are more than 5 million eligible Latino voters in Texas, representing 28.4 percent of the state's electorate. In the 2020 elections, nearly 3 million cast their ballots, supporting the Democratic US Senate (M.J. Hegar) and presidential candidates by a more than 2-1 margin; in other words 70 percent of Texas Latinos voted for the Hegar and Biden, compared to less than 20 percent of that state's white voters. More From Bill Gallegos Why We Should Honor the Chicano Moratorium Against the War August 29, 2024 Mexico Takes on the the United States' Gun Goliaths March 29, 2022 The UCLA precinct-level data confirms that Latinos continue to be a reliable electorate for the Democrats. However-and this is an important \"however\"-Donald Trump did increase his support among Latino voters, despite his outrageous racism, the Border Wall, and his promise to deport undocumented immigrants. But the study also warns that a significant number of Latino voters are \"persuadable swing voters.\" Texas also continues to be a state where Latinos have been unable to counter gerrymandering-which is designed to dilute the power of the Latino vote. Latinos Are Key to Progressive Change The bottom line is that Latinos are highly visible at election time. But our invisibility the rest of the time hides the hideous reality of our racial and national oppression: a massive wealth gap compared to whites, poor and under-resourced schools, police and migra repression, poor housing, super-exploitation in many workplaces, over-representation in the criminal justice system, and underrepresentation in higher education, suppression of our voting rights, oppression of our language and cultures, environmental and climate racism, and the continued loss of the our little remaining farmland. The electoral arena is one important arena for addressing these issues, and for building Latino power as a major progressive force in US politics. After all, polls continue to demonstrate strong Latino support for unions, for women's reproductive rights, for an expansion of voting rights for all oppressed communities, for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, for strong polices to address climate change, for universal medical care, expanded access to higher education, etc. Currently, the greatest threat to Latino voting power-and to democracy in general-comes from the Republican right. Common sense and an understanding of our community's interests should warn us to resist the siren song of the Republican Party, trying to reap the voting power we have worked so hard to grow and harvest. But we should also call out the Democratic Party for too often taking us for granted (Are you listening Joe Biden?), for failing once again to give sufficient priority to our issues and investing far too few resources into helping build our electoral power-not only as voters but also as candidates for office at the local, state, and national level. Without such support, the Democrats will indeed face grave danger-not from millions of our voters running to the Republicans, but from our people staying home at voting time, based on the feeling that we too often remain invisible and ignored.\n\nThe three largest US Latino population groups are Chicanos/Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans (not including those on the island), and Central Americans. These are all overwhelmingly working-class populations, and they share a tortured history with the US government: Puerto Ricans, direct US colonialism; Chicanos, US annexation of Mexico's northern territories; and Central Americans, displacement by US-supported wars or coups in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua. Other larger Latino populations from Cuba and Latin America (Venezuelans, Argentines, Chilenos) tend to be more middle- and upper-class. In an evil bit of irony, Mexicans did make the front pages of US newspapers and were often the lead in TV news shows in 2015-when Donald Trump kicked off his presidential campaign by characterizing Mexicans as \"rapists and criminals,\" and pledging to build a 2,000-mile wall along the US-Mexico border to prevent any further incursion by Mexican immigrants. Trump capped that despicable pledge by also promising to deport the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States-the overwhelming majority of whom are Latino. While the mainstream media carefully avoided the term \"ethnic cleansing,\" that is exactly what Trump was promising-to the hysterical cheers of his MAGA base, and the fired-up testosterone of the armed racist militias waving their guns at Mexicanos on the other side of the border. But other than the examples I have cited, the Latino population in this country is most often out of sight and out of mind, even in the media of the US left, which mostly continues to frame US politics within a strictly \"Black-white \"framework.

And that has to do with the growing numbers and potential power of the Latino electorate. When important elections roll around, lo and behold, we are suddenly found! Since the 2020 elections, there has been a veritable deluge of articles about Latino voters. Misconceptions about Latino voters These articles fall roughly into two categories. The one that has received the most attention is the notion that Latinos are essentially a conservative population, moving toward support for the Republican Party. The rationale for this assertion is that the GOP has been able to successfully appeal to the Latino values of family, church, and patriotism. This is not a new phenomenon, but one whose history extends as far back as the Nixon administration, which undertook a lukewarm effort to seduce Latino voters with these same threadbare arguments. One unspoken assumption of this argument is that there are other communities in the US that do not value family, faith, and country-a reflection of dominant thinking about African Americans within the Republican Party, and a cheap effort to divide Latinos and African Americans.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Another set of political articles argues that \"there is nothing to worry about,\" that Latinos continue to be strong supporters of the Democratic Party and are not going anywhere. In fact, an analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute of the 2020 elections strongly supports this assertion. Most of the articles warning about a Latino defection to the Republicans rely on exit polls for their analysis. The UCLA study, however, analyzed the record of ballots cast, thereby avoiding the errors that often emerge from the small and not necessarily representative sample provided by exit polls. Exit polls also fail to take into account the impact of early and absentee voters, or possibilities of language bias. Current Issue View our current issue The UCLA study analyzed Latino voting results for the US Senate in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas. The data strongly debunks the \"Latinos are going Republican\" myth. It turns out that Latinos in those states voted overwhelmingly for Democratic Senate candidates, with no data indicating a decline in Democratic support for the Senate. Latino voters went 3-1 for the Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia, and by a 2-1 margin in New Mexico, and Texas. What may be of interest, however, is that, except for Texas, Latino voters gave more votes to the Democratic candidates than to Joe Biden. Donald Trump received 2 to 3 percent more votes in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico than did the Democratic Senate candidates. The Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia received 10 percent more Latino votes than did Biden. Only in Texas was there no significant difference among Latinos in their votes for the Democratic Senate candidate and their votes for Joseph Biden. Although not a component of the UCLA study, Latino voters in the important swing of state Nevada also voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And, of course, Latino voters provided a significant part of Biden's huge electoral victory in California. As a Colorado homeboy, I was particularly interested in how the Chicanada had voted there is 2020. There are about 323,000 Latino registered voters in Colorado, accounting for 10.4 percent of the state's registered voters. According to the UCLA study, 315,000 cast their ballots in the 2020 election, shattering the myth that Latinos never show up at the polls. Latinos in Colorado voted for Biden and the Democratic Senate candidate, John Hickenlooper, by a 3-1 margin over the Republicans, or, put another way, 73 percent voted for Biden, and 76 percent for Hickenlooper. This demonstrates a level of voter loyalty that any serious political party would die for. By the way, less than half the white voters in my home state supported either Democratic candidate. Let's also look at Georgia, with its fast-growing Latino population. Most of us know that the victories in Georgia US Senate races by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were key to the Democrats' gaining a 50-50 split in the US Senate, enabling Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes. But most people don't realize how important the Latino vote was to those victories. An estimated 178,000 Latinos in Georgia voted in the 2020 election, representing 3.6 percent of the state's electorate. But-and this is a major \"but\"-the Georgia Senate elections were decided by fewer than 12,000 votes. Latino voters voted for the Democrat senatorial candidates by a greater than 3-1 margin (75 percent and 80 percent), clearly contributing to their margin of victory; they voted 67 percent for Biden. By contrast, less than 20 percent of white voters in Georgia supported any of the three Democratic candidates. A similar picture is advanced by the UCLA study for the other states, which demonstrates that the Latino electorate remains strongly in the Democratic column. Texas, again, presents a very interesting and somewhat different picture. There are more than 5 million eligible Latino voters in Texas, representing 28.4 percent of the state's electorate. In the 2020 elections, nearly 3 million cast their ballots, supporting the Democratic US Senate (M.J. Hegar) and presidential candidates by a more than 2-1 margin; in other words 70 percent of Texas Latinos voted for the Hegar and Biden, compared to less than 20 percent of that state's white voters. More From Bill Gallegos Why We Should Honor the Chicano Moratorium Against the War August 29, 2024 Mexico Takes on the the United States' Gun Goliaths March 29, 2022 The UCLA precinct-level data confirms that Latinos continue to be a reliable electorate for the Democrats. However-and this is an important \"however\"-Donald Trump did increase his support among Latino voters, despite his outrageous racism, the Border Wall, and his promise to deport undocumented immigrants. But the study also warns that a significant number of Latino voters are \"persuadable swing voters.\" Texas also continues to be a state where Latinos have been unable to counter gerrymandering-which is designed to dilute the power of the Latino vote. Latinos Are Key to Progressive Change The bottom line is that Latinos are highly visible at election time. But our invisibility the rest of the time hides the hideous reality of our racial and national oppression: a massive wealth gap compared to whites, poor and under-resourced schools, police and migra repression, poor housing, super-exploitation in many workplaces, over-representation in the criminal justice system, and underrepresentation in higher education, suppression of our voting rights, oppression of our language and cultures, environmental and climate racism, and the continued loss of the our little remaining farmland.

Although not a component of the UCLA study, Latino voters in the important swing of state Nevada also voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And, of course, Latino voters provided a significant part of Biden's huge electoral victory in California. As a Colorado homeboy, I was particularly interested in how the Chicanada had voted there is 2020. There are about 323,000 Latino registered voters in Colorado, accounting for 10.4 percent of the state's registered voters. According to the UCLA study, 315,000 cast their ballots in the 2020 election, shattering the myth that Latinos never show up at the polls. Latinos in Colorado voted for Biden and the Democratic Senate candidate, John Hickenlooper, by a 3-1 margin over the Republicans, or, put another way, 73 percent voted for Biden, and 76 percent for Hickenlooper. This demonstrates a level of voter loyalty that any serious political party would die for. By the way, less than half the white voters in my home state supported either Democratic candidate. Let's also look at Georgia, with its fast-growing Latino population. Most of us know that the victories in Georgia US Senate races by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were key to the Democrats' gaining a 50-50 split in the US Senate, enabling Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes. But most people don't realize how important the Latino vote was to those victories. An estimated 178,000 Latinos in Georgia voted in the 2020 election, representing 3.6 percent of the state's electorate. But-and this is a major \"but\"-the Georgia Senate elections were decided by fewer than 12,000 votes. Latino voters voted for the Democrat senatorial candidates by a greater than 3-1 margin (75 percent and 80 percent), clearly contributing to their margin of victory; they voted 67 percent for Biden. By contrast, less than 20 percent of white voters in Georgia supported any of the three Democratic candidates. A similar picture is advanced by the UCLA study for the other states, which demonstrates that the Latino electorate remains strongly in the Democratic column. Texas, again, presents a very interesting and somewhat different picture. There are more than 5 million eligible Latino voters in Texas, representing 28.4 percent of the state's electorate. In the 2020 elections, nearly 3 million cast their ballots, supporting the Democratic US Senate (M.J. Hegar) and presidential candidates by a more than 2-1 margin; in other words 70 percent of Texas Latinos voted for the Hegar and Biden, compared to less than 20 percent of that state's white voters.

However-and this is an important \"however\"-Donald Trump did increase his support among Latino voters, despite his outrageous racism, the Border Wall, and his promise to deport undocumented immigrants. But the study also warns that a significant number of Latino voters are \"persuadable swing voters.\" Texas also continues to be a state where Latinos have been unable to counter gerrymandering-which is designed to dilute the power of the Latino vote. Latinos Are Key to Progressive Change The bottom line is that Latinos are highly visible at election time. But our invisibility the rest of the time hides the hideous reality of our racial and national oppression: a massive wealth gap compared to whites, poor and under-resourced schools, police and migra repression, poor housing, super-exploitation in many workplaces, over-representation in the criminal justice system, and underrepresentation in higher education, suppression of our voting rights, oppression of our language and cultures, environmental and climate racism, and the continued loss of the our little remaining farmland. The electoral arena is one important arena for addressing these issues, and for building Latino power as a major progressive force in US politics. After all, polls continue to demonstrate strong Latino support for unions, for women's reproductive rights, for an expansion of voting rights for all oppressed communities, for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, for strong polices to address climate change, for universal medical care, expanded access to higher education, etc. Currently, the greatest threat to Latino voting power-and to democracy in general-comes from the Republican right. Common sense and an understanding of our community's interests should warn us to resist the siren song of the Republican Party, trying to reap the voting power we have worked so hard to grow and harvest. But we should also call out the Democratic Party for too often taking us for granted (Are you listening Joe Biden?), for failing once again to give sufficient priority to our issues and investing far too few resources into helping build our electoral power-not only as voters but also as candidates for office at the local, state, and national level. Without such support, the Democrats will indeed face grave danger-not from millions of our voters running to the Republicans, but from our people staying home at voting time, based on the feeling that we too often remain invisible and ignored.\n\nThese articles fall roughly into two categories. The one that has received the most attention is the notion that Latinos are essentially a conservative population, moving toward support for the Republican Party. The rationale for this assertion is that the GOP has been able to successfully appeal to the Latino values of family, church, and patriotism. This is not a new phenomenon, but one whose history extends as far back as the Nixon administration, which undertook a lukewarm effort to seduce Latino voters with these same threadbare arguments. One unspoken assumption of this argument is that there are other communities in the US that do not value family, faith, and country-a reflection of dominant thinking about African Americans within the Republican Party, and a cheap effort to divide Latinos and African Americans.

In fact, an analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute of the 2020 elections strongly supports this assertion. Most of the articles warning about a Latino defection to the Republicans rely on exit polls for their analysis. The UCLA study, however, analyzed the record of ballots cast, thereby avoiding the errors that often emerge from the small and not necessarily representative sample provided by exit polls. Exit polls also fail to take into account the impact of early and absentee voters, or possibilities of language bias. Current Issue View our current issue The UCLA study analyzed Latino voting results for the US Senate in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas. The data strongly debunks the \"Latinos are going Republican\" myth. It turns out that Latinos in those states voted overwhelmingly for Democratic Senate candidates, with no data indicating a decline in Democratic support for the Senate. Latino voters went 3-1 for the Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia, and by a 2-1 margin in New Mexico, and Texas. What may be of interest, however, is that, except for Texas, Latino voters gave more votes to the Democratic candidates than to Joe Biden. Donald Trump received 2 to 3 percent more votes in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico than did the Democratic Senate candidates. The Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia received 10 percent more Latino votes than did Biden.

But our invisibility the rest of the time hides the hideous reality of our racial and national oppression: a massive wealth gap compared to whites, poor and under-resourced schools, police and migra repression, poor housing, super-exploitation in many workplaces, over-representation in the criminal justice system, and underrepresentation in higher education, suppression of our voting rights, oppression of our language and cultures, environmental and climate racism, and the continued loss of the our little remaining farmland. The electoral arena is one important arena for addressing these issues, and for building Latino power as a major progressive force in US politics. After all, polls continue to demonstrate strong Latino support for unions, for women's reproductive rights, for an expansion of voting rights for all oppressed communities, for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, for strong polices to address climate change, for universal medical care, expanded access to higher education, etc. Currently, the greatest threat to Latino voting power-and to democracy in general-comes from the Republican right. Common sense and an understanding of our community's interests should warn us to resist the siren song of the Republican Party, trying to reap the voting power we have worked so hard to grow and harvest. But we should also call out the Democratic Party for too often taking us for granted (Are you listening Joe Biden?), for failing once again to give sufficient priority to our issues and investing far too few resources into helping build our electoral power-not only as voters but also as candidates for office at the local, state, and national level. Without such support, the Democrats will indeed face grave danger-not from millions of our voters running to the Republicans, but from our people staying home at voting time, based on the feeling that we too often remain invisible and ignored.\n\nLet's also look at Georgia, with its fast-growing Latino population. Most of us know that the victories in Georgia US Senate races by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were key to the Democrats' gaining a 50-50 split in the US Senate, enabling Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes. But most people don't realize how important the Latino vote was to those victories. An estimated 178,000 Latinos in Georgia voted in the 2020 election, representing 3.6 percent of the state's electorate. But-and this is a major \"but\"-the Georgia Senate elections were decided by fewer than 12,000 votes. Latino voters voted for the Democrat senatorial candidates by a greater than 3-1 margin (75 percent and 80 percent), clearly contributing to their margin of victory; they voted 67 percent for Biden. By contrast, less than 20 percent of white voters in Georgia supported any of the three Democratic candidates. A similar picture is advanced by the UCLA study for the other states, which demonstrates that the Latino electorate remains strongly in the Democratic column. Texas, again, presents a very interesting and somewhat different picture. There are more than 5 million eligible Latino voters in Texas, representing 28.4 percent of the state's electorate. In the 2020 elections, nearly 3 million cast their ballots, supporting the Democratic US Senate (M.J. Hegar) and presidential candidates by a more than 2-1 margin; in other words 70 percent of Texas Latinos voted for the Hegar and Biden, compared to less than 20 percent of that state's white voters. More From Bill Gallegos Why We Should Honor the Chicano Moratorium Against the War August 29, 2024 Mexico Takes on the the United States' Gun Goliaths March 29, 2022 The UCLA precinct-level data confirms that Latinos continue to be a reliable electorate for the Democrats. However-and this is an important \"however\"-Donald Trump did increase his support among Latino voters, despite his outrageous racism, the Border Wall, and his promise to deport undocumented immigrants.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nLacquer-haired presidential candidate Donald Trump, surrounded by Trump steaks, Trump water, and Trump's unique brand of flatulent self-satisfaction, had one more product to roll out as he preened at one of his exclusive golf courses following primary victories in Mississippi and Michigan. That product was retired New York Yankee great Paul O' Neill. Amid ramblings that caused MSNBC's Laurence O'Donnell to liken him to \"an incoherent ignoramus,\" Trump pointed the five-time World Series champion out in the crowd, gushed about how much he loved the 53-year-old ex-player, and asked in front of all the cameras if O'Neill endorsed him . O'Neill shouted, \"I'm here,\" followed by Trump blushing like a teenybopper, saying, \"I love you! Thank you!\" Then referencing the fact that O'Neill is from a certain critical upcoming primary state, Trump said, \"Now that I have Paul O'Neill's endorsement, I know I'm going to win Ohio.\" On the one hand, we can chalk this up as irrelevant theater. O'Neill joins such sports misfits as the proudly bigoted John Rocker, the proudly bigoted Mike Ditka, and two icons-Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman-who would endorse American Pharoah for president if it meant getting on camera. Yet Paul O'Neill is not a reality show contestant, like most of Trump's other athlete endorsers. O'Neill is more than an ex-Yankee. He's a broadcaster on Steinbrenner Soviet State Television, otherwise known the YES Network. He has become yet another example of Trump leveraging the sports world-and by extension a toothless sports media-to attain favorable coverage. Sure enough, O'Neill's endorsement has been all over the Web this morning, but the articles read more like Trump product placement than critical coverage. The articles mention O'Neill's lifetime batting average, his World Series heroics, and his Ohio roots. They don't mention some other salient facts: Baseball would not exist without Latino talent, particularly from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email In 2014, 26 percent of MLB players were born outside of the United States . Of those 26 percent, almost two-thirds are from Venezuela and the DR (roughly 17 percent of all Major League Baseball players). Donald Trump has of course made the attack on Latino immigrants the centerpiece of his campaign. Whether it's lies about the influx \"Mexican rapists,\" or lies that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border, or lies about the number of immigrants crossing into this country, or lies in his commercials claiming to show a run at the southern border, when the footage is actually from Morocco , Trump is playing a dangerous and racist game. He is thus far reaping the rewards, with support from white nationalist groups that traffic in the very violence he so casually provokes at his rallies. Trump has also enlisted the notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to assist him in his efforts. These are people who proudly endorse the idea of giving the police the right to check the papers of anyone they suspect of being \"illegals,\" codifying racial profiling and criminalizing anyone with brown skin. This brings us back to Paul O'Neill. He's not a circus sideshow like John Rocker or Dennis Rodman. He's not even someone like \"friend of the Trump campaign\" Tom Brady, whose sporting life does not put him in touch with many immigrants beyond the occasional East European placekicker. He is covering a sport where a requirement of the job is interacting with Latino players. What is O'Neill saying through this endorsement of Trump to former teammates like Mariano Rivera or the players he currently has to cover, like Michael Pineda? It calls into question just what Paul O'Neill is thinking these days about the game he ostensibly loves and the people paid to play it at the highest levels. Make no mistake about it. O'Neill has every right to endorse whom he wants, and no one should tell him to just \"shut up and play\" (or \"shut up and announce,\" as the case may be), but that doesn't mean the media has to be campaign stenographer instead of examining the implications of such a move. The demography of baseball is changing. If Paul O'Neill wants to drag it backward to a time when teams openly had racial quotas, he should make that clear and deal with the repercussions. When New Yorkers pay their inflated cable bills to subsidize the YES Network, they should know both who and what they are actually paying for.\n\nOn the one hand, we can chalk this up as irrelevant theater.

Embraces New Latino Voters in Arizona\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\ntranscript\n\n\"When I was a Democrat the wall signified white supremacy. Now it signifies security. This is the first year I switched completely and became a registered Republican. After the Trump assassination attempt, I decided to drop all my classes, my fall semester classes, and focus completely for this campaign because I knew that the Republican Party had a home for me. I am a proud Latino, both American and Mexican citizen. The Democratic Party has a problem with young men, specifically men of color. After the elections, they forget us. It does not understand men's pain, the loneliness in men. It cares about everyone but men. In 2016, I registered to vote to contribute to the Bernie Sanders campaign as a Democrat. I was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. I was a Bernie Victory Captain. When he lost, I did vote for Donald Trump. I did the same thing in 2020. I'd say that I felt pushed out. In this election, there wasn't even a single primary. We didn't get our voice heard. They chose a candidate for us and they told us, 'If you don't vote for her, you're a sexist.' I felt like it had no place for a young Latino like me.\" \"We, as older Republicans, we welcome them.\" \"This Mexican American woman gave me a little pamphlet for a prayer group. Blanca, she's the wife of Gerry Navarro, who ran as a Republican in Santa Cruz. And she just was very nice treating me like a human being. And I saw this kindness.\" \"The younger Latino males want values that represent them, No. 1.\" \"I started to realize that Republicans aren't anti-immigration. They're anti-illegal immigration. And the Democratic Party, they just kept telling me, 'You are racist.'\" \"No. 2, they're looking at the economy. They want to have a house. They want to be able to afford things.\" \"I just want to have a family. How can I do that when the Democratic Party is not focusing on the economy and making sure I have the ability to take care of my family?\" \"The Democrats are seeing Latinos as: You follow me because I'm telling you to. And they're not going to fall for that anymore. There's a definite bridge that we have started, and we hope to continue that bridge.\"\n\nBy Alex Pena\n\nReporting from Nogales, Arizona\n\nJosé Castro is one of the many younger Latino men in Arizona who have shifted to the right and wholeheartedly embraced Donald J. Trump this election. Support for Mr. Trump among Hispanic male voters rose significantly nationwide.\n\nMr. Castro, 26, campaigned for Senator Bernie Sanders eight years ago. But after Hillary Clinton became the Democratic presidential nominee, Mr. Castro said, he voted for Mr. Trump, citing his anti-establishment appeal. Still, for the past decade, he has continued to vote for Democrats down the ballot.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump won Arizona, flipping the swing state back into Republican hands. And while there has long been a contingent of steadfast Latino Republican voters in the state, younger Latinos like Mr. Castro, who have been feeling shut out and left behind by Democrats, are finding their way to the Republican Party.\n\n\" The Democratic Party has a problem with young men,\" said Mr. Castro, who officially switched his registration from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party this year. \"It cares about everyone but men.\"\n\nGerry Navarro, 72, a longtime Republican, agrees. \"The younger Latino males want true values that represent them,\" he said. \"We, as older Republicans, we welcomed them.\"\n\nAlthough Vice President Kamala Harris won a majority of Latino votes nationwide, she lost several states, including Florida and Texas, with sizable Latino populations.\n\nAdvertisement"

Tim Walz of Minnesota, the first formal endorsement of a presidential ticket in the group's 95-year history.\n\nLeaders of the group, known as LULAC, acknowledged that it had previously refrained from endorsing political candidates but said that members were stirred to action by concerns over the potential negative impact on Latinos if former President Donald J.

Trump's campaign promise to carry out the largest deportation effort in the nation's history, one modeled on a 1950s initiative called \" Operation Wetback .\"\n\nRather, Mr. Gavic said he saw Mr. Trump as drawing practical parallels with that earlier operation. He dismissed concerns that the plan would target Latinos.\n\n\"I don't think he is going to start rounding up Mexicans or Venezuelans,\" said Mr. Gavic, a Republican who remodels homes in a Milwaukee suburb. \"He is just going to put in an effective plan to round up or corral or target those people who really shouldn't be here.\"\n\nRepublicans gathered in Milwaukee this week for their national convention adopted an immigration platform in line with Mr. Trump's agenda. In addition to a mass deportation plan, the platform includes pledges to finish the wall and to \"stop the migrant invasion.\" The messaging is even harsher in tone than when Mr. Trump first ran for president in 2016. But Republicans are betting it won't turn off Latino voters this election cycle.\n\nSurveys and focus groups show that Latino voters, like other Americans , have warmed to more punitive measures on illegal immigration, and that more Latinos are saying they trust Mr. Trump and Republicans over President Biden and Democrats to better handle migration at the Southern border. The trend lines are especially true for Latino Republicans and right-leaning independents, who are more likely to call the situation at the border a crisis, and to echo Mr. Trump's depictions of undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety, national security and the nation's cultural identity.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump succeeded in peeling away significant amounts of Latino support, and not just in conservative-leaning geographic areas, according to a post-mortem analysis of the election that was released on Friday.\n\nConducted by the Democratically aligned research firm Equis Labs, the report found that certain demographics within the Latino electorate had proved increasingly willing to embrace Mr. Trump as the 2020 campaign went on, including conservative Latinas and those with a relatively low level of political engagement.\n\nUsing data from Equis Labs' polls in a number of swing states, as well as focus groups, the study found that within those groups, there was a shift toward Mr. Trump across the country, not solely in areas like Miami or the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, where the growth in Mr. Trump's Latino support has been widely reported.\n\n\"In 2020, a segment of Latino voters demonstrated that they are more 'swing' than commonly assumed,\" the report stated.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Trump outperformed his 2016 showing among Latino voters , earning the support of about one in three nationwide, even as Joseph R. Biden Jr. won those voters by a roughly two-to-one margin over all, according to exit polls .\n\nAll told, close to 17 million Latino voters turned out in the general election, according to a separate analysis published in January by the U.C.L.A. Latino Policy & Politics Initiative. That represented an uptick of more than 30 percent from 2016 - and the highest level of Latino participation in history.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Credit... Andrew Cullen for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Adam Nagourney and Jennifer Medina\n\nSANTA ANA, Calif. - Vicente Sarmiento remembers when the local Republican Party here posted uniformed guards at polling stations in a closely fought State Assembly race three decades ago and they hoisted signs in English and Spanish warning that noncitizens were prohibited from voting. The guards were removed after state elections officials threatened legal action.\n\nSuch tactics would never take place today in this city 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles, where Mr. Sarmiento is now the mayor pro tem. All seven members of the City Council, including Mr. Sarmiento, are Latino, as are 78 percent of the 343,000 people who live here.\n\n(Leer en español) »\n\nThese days, Santa Ana stands as the face of a new California, a state where Latinos have more influence in everyday life - electorally, culturally and demographically - than almost anywhere else in the country.\n\nThere are limits to the transformation here, both in economics, where Latinos still lag far behind the state as a whole, and in politics, where remarkable gains in Latino power have not yet translated to the most powerful statewide offices. But the Latino progress in this state offers a glimpse of how much of the country will probably look in coming decades.\n\nImmigrants living illegally in California are entitled to driver's licenses. Their children can receive state-funded health insurance. Local law enforcement officials generally do not provide information to federal immigration authorities, as they do in many other parts of the country.

      "text": "The American Latino Experience: 20 Essential Films Since 2000\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nIn Hollywood, Hispanic stories usually mean ones from other countries. The features and documentaries on this list explore U.S. lives that deserve the spotlight, too.\n\nCredit... Illustration by Ricardo Santos; Clockwise from top left: The Orchard (\"We The Animals\"); Motto Pictures/Naked Edge Films (\"Southwest of Salem\"); Andrea Morini/Screen Gems (\"Girlfight\"); Fireworks Pictures (\"Raising Victor Vargas\"); Nicola Goode/HBO (\"Real Women Have Curves\"); Samuel Goldwyn Films (\"Tortilla Soup\")\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Carlos Aguilar\n\nHollywood still doesn't get it.\n\nLatinos are not a monolith. The context, details and nuances that go into telling the story of a family in Mexico City won't be the same for the story of a family in Los Angeles, which would in turn differ for one in Miami. American-born or -raised Latinos have unique life experiences, straddling the line between assimilation and pride in their heritage, which the big studios frequently fail to acknowledge. Such movies do exist, though often on the periphery. And they're worth seeking out to help foster conversations about the intricacies of Latinidad. That's why, as we observe National Hispanic Heritage Month , I've put together a list of must-watch films centered on American Latino protagonists.\n\nWhy is such a specific list necessary?\n\nLargely untold in mass media or classrooms, the history of Latinos in the United States is long, winding and impossible to dissect in simple terms. Shaped by arbitrary borders in the aftermath of wars, colonization and waves of migration from nearly two dozen nations across the Americas, our presence is intrinsic to this country. Yet, American Latinos remain mostly invisible in our collective narrative, a narrative that very much includes the images we consume.\n\nWe do get plenty of movies about Latino experiences, just not American ones. Every year festivals and theaters screen numerous films from Mexico and South America. Then there's the work of the Three Amigos, the gifted Mexican directors Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro , who tell lavish stories with great universality that we can all enjoy. The same can be said of Pixar's \"Coco,\" the 2017 hit set in a small Mexico town with Mexican characters. American Latinos can see themselves and their families in it because of our inherent connections, of course.\n\nBut border-crossing stories or those set in Latin America don't fill the void created by the lack of American Latino narratives. They don't reflect the lives of, say, Chicanos in California, Tejanos in rural Texas or Nuyoricans in the Bronx - specific identities that have faced oppression in the United States. Instead, the entertainment industry desperately tries to fit all Latinos under one label, devoid of nuance, often erasing Afro-Latinos and Indigenous peoples.\n\nIdeally more movies would address the breadth of Latino experience, whether immigrant or born and raised here, Spanish speaker or English only. It's not the Three Amigos' personal responsibility to tap into those narratives, but the deserved success of Cuarón, Iñárritu and del Toro hasn't translated into more access for American Latinos.\n\nNot only are roles and productions centered on American Latinos scarce, but those that do exist rarely receive proper recognition. The last American Latino star to be nominated for an Academy Award was Benicio Del Toro for \"21 Grams\" (2003). No American Latinos have ever been nominated for best director. The Criterion Collection , the curated Blu-ray/DVD archive of acclaimed films, features only one with an American Latino protagonist (\"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez\" by Robert M. Young). The sole American Latino filmmaker included, Gregory Nava, made it in for a film about Guatemalan migrants (\"El Norte\").\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Is Hispanic the Same Thing as Latina?\n\nRead more from Slate's coverage of Sonia Sotomayor's nomination .\n\nBarack Obama announced Tuesday that he would nominate 2 nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. The New York Times wrote that Sotomayor, if confirmed, would be \"the nation's first Hispanic justice.\" But Sotomayor has referred to herself in the past as \"a Latina judge.\" Do Hispanic and Latina mean the same thing?\n\nNot exactly. Hispanic is an English word that originally referred to people from Spain and eventually expanded to include the populations of its colonies in South and Central America. Latino is a Spanish word-hence the feminine form Latina -that refers to people with roots in Latin America and generally excludes the Iberian Peninsula. For many, Hispanic has negative connotations because of its Eurocentrism. Others prefer it because it's gender-neutral. Latino , meanwhile, is perceived as a more authentic-sounding, Spanish-language alternative. Generally speaking, Democrats use Latino more often than Republicans, who favor Hispanic .\n\nFor years, Spanish-speaking people in the United States were identified according to their ancestral nationality. In the 1970 U.S. census, for example, people were asked whether they were Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or \"other Spanish.\" (The question caused much confusion because many Americans from the middle or southern regions of the United States identified themselves as \"Central or South American.\") The word Hispanic was not used until the 1980 census, after the Office of Management and Budget imposed rules standardizing ethnicity statistics. (The change came after a federal committee on minority education complained about the lack of useful data.) In 1997, the OMB changed its classification to \"Hispanic or Latino,\" explaining that \"Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion.\"\n\nSome commentators have wondered whether Sotomayor would really be the first Hispanic justice. After all, Benjamin Cardozo , who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1932, had family who originated in Portugal . But most Portuguese speakers-whether from Portugal or Brazil-do not consider themselves Hispanic or Latino. Furthermore, Cardozo identified as a Sephardic Jew. That said, former Rep. Tony Coelho and Rep. Dennis Cardoza, both of whom have roots in Portugal, have been members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nUltimately, there is no strict definition of Hispanic or Latino . The College Board, which administers the SAT, leaves it up to the student to self-identify. The U.S. Census Bureau makes no distinction between the two terms. It defines Hispanics and Latinos as \"persons who trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Spanish speaking Central and South America countries, and other Spanish cultures.\" But if someone from Brazil says he's Hispanic, the census doesn't say, No, you're not .\n\nGot a question about today's news?

      "text": "The Latino Community Is Finally Coming to Grips With Its Own Racism\n\nCoexistence between black and Latino Americans hasn't always been easy. According to a 2008 study , while both communities view each other favorably, Latinos expressed skepticism about the extent to which black people face discrimination in the United States. That might be changing. For the Latino community, the outpouring of grief and outrage of the past couple of weeks has brought a reckoning.\n\nLast Monday, in a landmark Miami Herald op-ed , more than 40 organizations, activists, and journalists acknowledged the Latino community's omissions in combating racism. \"We have failed to grapple with anti-blackness that exists in our own community,\" the authors write. \"We have been raised in families who refer to blackness in the diminutive ( morenita, negrita, prietita ). We have remained silent when our tías have encouraged us to partner with people who have lighter skin than we do so we can mejorar la raza.\"\n\nOver the past few days, other voices have argued that Latinos should reflect on their own identity. In a piece for NBC News, Ana Sanz, a young Afro-Latinx protester, told reporter Nicole Acevedo that \"white-presenting Latinos should use this time to 'reconcile with the privilege' their light skin gives them in systems tainted with white supremacy.\" Jasmine Haywood, an Afro-Latina scholar who has specialized in anti-black Latino racism, told Acevedo that Latinos must begin by acknowledging the common struggle they historically share with the black community. \"What Latinos need to realize is that our oppression is bound up and intertwined with the oppression of the black community,\" she said.\n\nThere are encouraging signs of this reckoning in an unlikely place: Los Angeles.\n\nNot many cities in the United States have a history of racism and police brutality quite like Los Angeles. In 1992, the city endured five days of riots after the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the brutal beating of Rodney King. The riots, which left 63 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, exposed the severity of the city's racism and the cruel methods of its police force.\n\nAs the city's reaction to the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis has proved, outrage over police brutality has, quite justifiably, never dissipated. The city's wounds are still raw. As a Hispanic, immigrant reporter, I found one of the most remarkable aspects of the protests to be the fervent solidarity of Latinos, most of them young, with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"There is a lot of repair to be done between these two communities and I'm here with my tools to start the job,\" wrote Marlene Cordova, a California State University, Los Angeles senior, for the website EdSource. For young Latinos like Cordova, who also recognize their community's failings but seek to make a difference in their own fight against prejudice in America, the protests seem to have become a turning point in a common struggle with the black community. Their solidarity appears both permanent and proactive.\n\nFor some, the discovery of this sense of cohesion between the Latino and black American struggles against racism might be new. For others, the story is different. Within the protests, Univision's cameras found voices for whom the confluence of both identities-and their struggles-is completely familiar. In Hollywood, reporter Salvador Durán crossed paths with a young Spanish-speaking black man, Carlos Vargas. \"I want to be able to call police and know they will help me, not hurt me,\" he said . \"We have a voice. There's no skin color for us, there's only heart. We are here because of the injustice against my people, my two people: African Americans and Hispanics.\"\n\nAs a toddler, Vargas had been adopted by a Mexican family in Southern California. A couple of days after the protests, he welcomed Durán to his mother's home. \"He came to me as a 2-year-old, but in one week he was dancing quebradita ,\" said María Vargas, Carlos' mother. He then introduced one of his siblings, a young white man who had also been adopted by the Vargas family. \"I don't see race. He's my brother, and I love him,\" Vargas' brother said , with Carlos by his side.\n\nLast week, with protests on the move across Los Angeles, I spoke with Lamar Thorpe , a councilman in the city of Antioch in Northern California. I had read an honest and stirring account Thorpe had written about his experiences as a young black boy growing up in a Hispanic home during the Rodney King riots. Although Thorpe was never officially adopted by the Mexican family that welcomed him as a newborn, he grew up much like Carlos Vargas: He felt Mexican through and through. It wasn't until the riots that he realized that something was different. \"[The riots] didn't hit me as hard as it did others in school. They felt afraid. I didn't,\" he recalled. The fact that he saw the riots differently, he explained, had to do with the things he had heard growing up in a Hispanic area. While his own family never showed any prejudice against black people, his friends and neighbors did. \"I didn't like looking in the mirror because I was black,\" Thorpe told me. In college, Thorpe reconciled with his black identity. He now considers himself both Mexican and black.\n\nAs the Latino community continues to figure out its role in this historic chapter in the struggle against racism in the United States, it would be wise to listen to voices like Thorpe and Vargas. Thorpe, for one, hopes the current protests become an opportunity to address the mistrust between the two cultures and to foster a new era of solidarity. \"Just like it hurts me to hear Latinos say, 'What are black people to us?' it also hurts me to hear African Americans say, 'Why do we want these immigrants? They are here only to take our jobs,' \" Thorpe told me. \"We have similar stories. This violence has affected Latinos, African Americans, and other minorities in the country.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How Much of the New American Songbook Will Be Sung in Spanish?\n\nIs it really possible that today's Latino musicians will be remembered primarily via the dude from Matchbox Twenty? Slate's New American Songbook , a project dedicated to predicting which songs from the past 25 years will make an enduring impact and become \"the new oldies,\" reflects several of the most prominent contours of the pop cultural terrain of the past quarter-century: hip-hop's rise as our most influential form of pop music , the triumph of late '90s R&B girl groups, and even the persistence of rock more than 60 years after its birth. But what's less represented is Spanish-language music. Other than a nod to the mortifying salsa-rock kitsch of Santana and Rob Thomas' \"Smooth,\" the contributions of Latinos and Spanish-speaking communities are largely absent. At a time when Spanish-language music is thriving in the mainstream United States, and Latino artists are shaping the future of music consumption across the globe, how could it be that out of 30 songs, the list contains little more Spanish than a post-grunge frontman cooing \"My muñequita \"?\n\nThe easy answer would be to cite too-familiar and oft-repeated myths about language barriers separating Anglo audiences from appreciating Spanish-language music. But the truth is that Spanish-language music's continued segregation in the mainstream U.S. market also stems from long-standing preconceptions and marketing conventions Latino artists have had to navigate for decades. Spanish-language pop music might be having a moment, but as I've written at Remezcla, it seems Latino pop stars are only seen through the lens of crossover culture -that is, the mainstream media tends to only cover them when they make an impact on Anglo audiences, using Anglo metrics of success. No matter the decades of rich cultural and musical contributions we've given this country, our work typically only gets acknowledged when it becomes a global phenomenon or tops the Hot 100, even if it's already a favorite in Latino spaces. And even then, we're usually forced to play into clichéd representations of Latino identity-think of the stereotypes of the Latino lover or the \"spicy Latina\" (that muñequita , or little doll, is described as so hot she could \"melt everyone\"). Or we're only regarded as one-time novelty acts (take the stadium-conquering spread of the \"Macarena,\" another song that narrowly missed making this list ). Even Cardi B, J Balvin, and Bad Bunny's summer smash \" I Like It ,\" a song performed by solely Latino artists, sparked concern among fans for the hackneyed reference to Cardi as a \"spicy mami, hot tamale.\" These tropes are used to pander to Anglo listeners-a tactic that's proved successful time and again.\n\nWhile we've forged our own mechanisms of recognition (the Latin Grammys, Spanish-language radio and TV, etc.), these enterprises have also inadvertently created a pernicious segregation of markets that's shut Latinos out of many conversations about popular music. Spanish-language music revered in Latino households doesn't usually sound like Santana and Rob Thomas' \"Smooth,\" even if that megahit may be beloved by English-speaking listeners outside the culture.\n\nBut thankfully, some of that seems to be changing, due in part to demographic shifts. There's the oft-cited statistic that by 2044, non-Latino whites will be the minority demographic population in the U.S., which will certainly shape future institutions and the culture at large. Even more importantly, according to the Pew Research Center, Latinos already became the second-largest demographic group behind non-Latino whites, as well as the second-fastest growing ethnic group in the country, only two years ago. Members of the community are slowly becoming the gatekeepers that will determine what's programmed on radio and playlists, what acts get major-label backing, and what gets booked at national festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza, which could shape national attitudes about Latino identity across the mainstream. Of course, inclusion doesn't necessarily lead to transformation in the upper echelons of the music industry-but giving the keys to tastemakers and leaders who are actually invested in changing representations of Latinos will.\n\nThat's not to say there will be a utopia for Spanish-language music in this country 25 years from now, or even that Latinos themselves share a monolithic understanding of what music is worth celebrating. We remain a community of difference, defined by distinct languages, cultures, and races. But it might mean that the hegemonic predisposition to treat Latino identity as a novelty or a token will gradually erode, as we take control of the marketing practices around our identities and create new avenues for artistic exploration-both above and underground.\n\nBeyond demographics, the actual nature of Spanish-language pop music is undergoing a reckoning, and it's going to change the way we think about what songs are enshrined as classics. Reggaeton has experienced a massive transformation since its birth in the 1990s, when it was a much-maligned genre pioneered by black Panamanians and Puerto Ricans. It's no longer the stigmatized music of the underclass, and its sonic transformation over the past few years-with saccharine, romantic lyrics and palatable pop beats, which many feel is an erasure of the genre's political roots-has cemented it as the accessible and dominant form of pop music across Latin America. Even if it's through dembow-lite excursions with familiar Anglo pop stars such as \"Despacito\" (a song that was itself ushered into the Anglo mainstream by Justin Bieber ), the genre's continued ascent since its surge in popularity in the mid-'00s all but guarantees that reggaeton will soundtrack weddings, family celebrations, road trips, and beyond. Certainly, we can expect Spanish-language radio to maintain oldies stations that keep traditional genres like norteños, banda, salsa, bolero, bachata, and merengue in their rotation, and the inroads made by stalwarts like Héctor Lavoe, Jenni Rivera, Celia Cruz, and Antony Santos will continue to be celebrated. But as more and more pop stars and conventional balladeers hop on the pop-dembow wave (for better or worse), it seems assured that reggaeton will continue to establish itself as the music that defined a generation.\n\nThe future of other genres is less certain. It remains an open question whether Spanish-language trap, which has ignited a controversial revolution in the Latino music industry, will fizzle out. And while movements like rock en español , once hailed as a defiant alternative to the pop-driven Spanish-language music industry, have become stale, with fans aging into their own segment of the market, that shouldn't stop the Caifanes and Maná hits of today from finding a resting home on oldies radio 25 years from now.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent tidal wave of bilingual hits-both via collaborations with Anglo pop stars and in individual compositions by Latino artists-isn't likely to crest anytime soon. Though we'll likely remember this as the era when major labels attempted to replicate smashes like \"Despacito\" by pairing Latino stars with Anglo ones for Frankenstein collabs, this could easily become a gimmick that will begin to grate on listeners if it's not done organically.\n\nAfter all, more bilingual music is a natural reflection of differences in language use across generations in Latino communities. As the Pew Research Center reported in 2012, Latinos are fairly evenly split between those who listen mostly to English-language music and those who listen to mostly Spanish-language music, and 27 percent of Latinos say they listen to music in both languages equally. With bilingual songs of the summer like \"Despacito\" and \"I Like It\" easily summiting the Billboard charts, long-held assumptions about Anglo listeners' refusal to consume music in other languages are getting a reality check. In this complex global music climate, in which listeners are increasingly language-agnostic, we'll likely see more of these bilingual productions receive support from labels and their counterparts in the Latino, mainstream U.S., and global markets, ensuring that we'll be singing along in multiple languages for years to come.\n\nTo be sure, the work is far from over, and there are many possible futures for Latino artists. A truly unexpected fate would be one that finds Latino artists free from pigeonholing and stereotyping, incorporated into the musical landscape in an ongoing, dynamic way. Or better yet, a commitment to equity for black Latino artists, who are often left behind by a music industry that runs on colorism.\n\nIn an increasingly globalized world, and in an increasingly Latino country, we are bound to create more and more of the songs that will be belted at stadiums and blasted from car radios. Whether we are able to take charge of our own musical identities and to present them as more than clichéd commodities, or to overcome constant neglect from Anglo media and entertainment platforms, on the other hand, remains to be seen. One thing's for sure: We need fewer feel-good narratives of cultural exchange and respect, and more opportunities to be seen on our own terms-not filtered through the lens of Justin Bieber and Rob Thomas.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "There Is a Very Wrong Lesson to Take From Kamala Harris' Performance Among Black and Latino Voters\n\nWhy is Kamala Harris doing worse with Black and Latino voters than previous Democratic presidential candidates? That's the campaign topic of the week after a New York Times/Siena poll found Harris winning only 57 percent of Hispanic voters-a step down from the estimated 63 percent that Joe Biden won in 2020-and 78 percent of Black voters, 15 points less than Biden's estimated 2020 share. In the New York Times, David Leonhardt suggested an explanation for the disparity that echoes a centrist critique we've heard a lot over the past few years: The problem is identity politics, particularly on the issue of immigration.\n\nAccording to Leonhardt, the Democratic Party is suffering because it has made \"the wrong diagnosis of the American electorate\" when it comes to race and ethnicity. Democrats, he says, assume that people of color constitute a homogeneous voting bloc whose loyalty can be best earned through acts that speak to their \"racial identity,\" like the 2022 appointment of a Black woman, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the Supreme Court. (That's Leonhardt's example, not mine.)\n\nThe party assumes that voters of color will be won over by progressive gestures on every issue that touches on race , he charges, and fails to recognize that many nonwhite voters are concerned about problems like crime and undocumented immigration. The Biden administration has exacerbated the impact of this misunderstanding, he says, by loosening rules at the U.S.-Mexico border and waving millions of new residents into the country like a friendly crossing guard.\n\nWhile the piece makes some fair points (more on that later), there are several problems with this narrative. To begin with, Democrats do seem to understand that Black voters can be concerned about crime; the party's presidential nominee is a Black woman who worked for nearly 30 years as a prosecutor and wrote a book about reducing crime . As president, Joe Biden has fixated on funneling additional funds to police departments at the expense of pursuing criminal justice reform-to the point that one of Leonhardt's colleagues, Charles Blow, wrote a column lamenting the relative priorities in 2022 . Say what you will about the current administration's approach to the matter, but it has not been one characterized by soft, progressive appeals to identity rather than enforcement.\n\nThe argument that Biden's \"welcoming immigration policies\" have triggered a border crisis, though, is the crux of Leonhardt's piece. He cites three policies in particular: An early-term attempt to pause deportations while conducting a broad review of immigration issues; a so-called parole program that had admitted 500,000 individuals when CBS reported on it in mid-2023; and a 2021 expansion of asylum eligibility standards to victims of domestic violence or criminal gangs.\n\nIt's true that, under Biden, the U.S. did experience a large increase in the number of individuals crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in order to apply for asylum. Somewhat confusingly, even people who cross the border illegally have the legal right to apply for asylum once they're here, but it's happening in such numbers as to overwhelm the systems set up to deal with it, and it's perceived by a majority of voters as a crisis .\n\nBut Leonhardt ignores that the current border surge began during Trump's presidency , as can be seen in the graph in this piece . At two points, spring 2019 and late 2020, apprehensions of undocumented individuals at the southern border were higher under Trump than they'd ever been under his liberal, Democratic predecessor. In 2019, they were twice as high as what had ever been seen under Obama-whose 2014 launch of \"deferred action\" programs, which protect certain categories of undocumented immigrants who have established residency inside the country from deportation, is sometimes cited as the starting point of the party's soft-on-migration era.\n\nThe reality that crossings surged to these levels even under Trump, despite the severe policies he enacted in an ostensible effort to deter them, calls into question the premise that there's anything Democrats (or Republicans) could do to suppress attempted crossings to a point that voters would find acceptable and \"secure.\" Bear in mind that for migrants, conditions of impoverishment and/or violence in their native countries are apparently so intolerable that they decide their best option is to make a lengthy trip through a desert, on foot, that has a good chance of ending with deportation back to their original home or \"removal\" to the makeshift northern Mexico tent camps that the Times' reporting has described as \"squalid\" and \"filthy.\"\n\nOn top of this, Biden's border policy wasn't actually welcoming . His deportation pause was terminated by a judge after only five days . Much more impactfully, Biden extended a COVID-era Trump administration policy called Title 42, which allowed the government to immediately expel asylum-seekers on the grounds of public health without granting them a hearing, through 2023. And when Title 42 expired, the administration immediately put into place what the Associated Press described as \"a series of new policies cracking down on illegal crossings.\"\n\nThe purpose of the \"parole\" program Leonhardt mentions, meanwhile, was to resettle refugees of war (most prominently from Ukraine and Afghanistan) and to reward individuals who applied for residence via their home countries rather than sneaking in through Mexico. The CBS News article he links to as evidence of a loosened border policy actually concludes that \"parole authority has allowed officials to divert migration away from the southern border\" (emphasis mine).\n\nAll told, according to a review published by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute this June, deportations have continued under Biden at the same pace that they did during the Trump administration . When you add that number to the immediate expulsions that were carried out under Title 42, the MPI writes, \"the Biden administration's nearly 4.4 million repatriations are already more than any single presidential term since the George W. Bush administration.\" Doesn't sound very inviting, does it?\n\nSo Leonhardt might be wrong about what the Biden administration has done, and about what even the most punitive border policy could accomplish given the limited resources available at the border, the external factors contributing to immigration \"flows,\" and the troublesome fact-often ignored in mainstream press coverage of the issue-that the right to seek asylum is enshrined in both U.S. and international laws passed in the wake of the Holocaust. (The current limitation on resources at the border, for what it's worth, has essentially been imposed by the Republican Party .) His case might be more realistically phrased as an argument that Democrats are having problems because they project inclusive \"vibes\" toward immigrants in general by speaking in broad terms about immigration's benefits and continuing to favor policies that would provide a \"path to citizenship\" for undocumented individuals inside the U.S.\n\nIs he right about that ? I think the answer is still no.\n\nTo begin with, consider the assumption in his piece's headline: \"Democrats imagined that they would become the majority party as America became more racially diverse. It's not working out that way.\" One might conclude from this that Democrats are in trouble electorally-a minority party, even. But for starters, they've won the presidential popular vote in the past four elections. In 2018, at the height of Trump's anti-immigration crackdown, they took over the House; in 2020, they won the White House and both chambers of Congress. In 2022, they lost the House, but held the Senate as Trump-affiliated candidates underperformed across the country. Polling is inexact and the margins involved are currently quite narrow, but most forecasting models are leaning toward Kamala Harris winning the presidency and Democrats retaking the House of Representatives . Leonhardt himself even concedes that \"Harris is winning most voters of color.\"\n\nPut simply, voters have rewarded Democrats for who they've been-the party of pluralism, let's say-during the Trump era. It might not be desirable, or even possible, to separate that \"brand\" from a reputation for being broadly pro-immigrant.\n\nThere is, certainly, a line that must be walked. The aggregate position of the U.S. electorate is basically that undocumented immigrants are OK if they are established inside the country, but not when they are crossing the border, which is, of course, the only way that many of them can get inside the country. Voters want border policies that are \"tough,\" but also for the most part felt that Trump's policies were too tough. (It seems to have gotten lost that promising  to pull back from Trump programs like the \"Muslim ban\" and family separation was something Democrats did with the support of the general public , rather than being a minority position they were hectored into taking by activists.)\n\nIn sum, voters generally support inclusion, humane treatment, and \"order,\" and tend to change their position on which is more important depending on which party is in charge and the extent to which migrant tent encampments or other symbols of dis -order are visible in the places they live or on the news. If you ask them , majorities of voters support deporting undocumented immigrants and providing them with a path to citizenship. Maybe this is a case of boneheaded median-voter brain, akin to supporting lower taxes, higher spending, and a balanced federal budget. Or it could simply be an interest in seeing someone do something about an issue that has become particularly visible-an interest in knowing that things are being, in some sort of organized way, handled.\n\nEither way, it does not suggest a public verdict so clear-cut that the Democratic Party should give up what has been possibly its most durable asset since the civil rights era-the public sense that it stands for evolving, multiracial democracy. Many United States voters lean that way, and they have already shown that they can be the basis of a winning coalition. Call me an idealist, but I also don't think all of these voters are simply engaged in progressive virtue signaling. Maybe they simply say that undocumented immigrants should get a chance to work toward citizenship, or that it is a good idea to have a Black woman on the Supreme Court at least once every 235 years , because they think that's how America ought to work. And shouldn't they have a party too?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The GOP's Two Latino Problems\n\nPhoto by John Moore/Getty Images\n\nWith his angry rants against undocumented immigrants, Donald Trump is a stark reminder of the GOP's terrible problem with Latino voters. In short, Latinos don't like-or trust-the Republican Party.\n\nBut Trump also illustrates a second, more complicated problem. As long as his rhetoric has a place in Republican politics-as long as it has defenders-it won't just alienate Latinos. It will offend and turn off voters who have conservative ideas and beliefs but won't sanction or support anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nBefore looking at this other side to the \"Latino problem,\" it's worth examining the first one. In the past two presidential elections, Democrats have won more than two-thirds of Latino voters, reversing and eroding gains made during George W. Bush's administration. Part of this is anti-Republican backlash after the 2008 recession and the tail end of the Bush presidency, but even more is the intense anti-immigration wave that swept the GOP in the wake of the Tea Party's rapid rise to prominence.\n\nIn the past six years, GOP states have targeted Latinos for greater scrutiny, GOP officials have called for \"self-deportation\" of undocumented immigrants, and GOP presidential candidates have stood with nakedly anti- immigrant politicians. And although there are smart, reasoned arguments against comprehensive immigration reform and other permissive immigration policies, the rhetoric that counts-that resonates with actual Republican voters-comes from figures such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, who once warned that a path to citizenship would \"destroy our republic.\"\n\nAt this point, Latinos don't just oppose particular candidates, such as Mitt Romney. They disdain the Republican label itself. According to a 2014 survey from the Pew Research Center , just 10 percent of Latinos say that the Republican Party \"has concern\" for their communities, compared with 50 percent who say as much about the Democratic Party. Few agree with Republicans on policy-especially immigration-and just 27 percent of Latinos identify with the Republican Party, compared with 63 percent who identify with Democrats. Not surprisingly, this has carried over to the 2016 GOP presidential field. As of October, notes Latino Decisions , just 32 percent of Latino voters would consider a vote for Jeb Bush, just 35 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Marco Rubio, and just 24 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nWriting for the Washington Post -and prompted by Trump and the qualified defense he received from writers such as Rich Lowry of the National Review -conservative columnist Michael Gerson examines the two Republican camps for dealing with this \"Latino problem\" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe first camp, best represented by Jeb Bush, wants to expand the Republican brand into Latino communities. It believes the GOP is \"too closely identified with the boardroom and the country club,\" Gerson writes, and wants to fix that with outreach to new constituencies. If Republicans could return to their earlier performance with Latino voters, they could win Colorado and Nevada, or at least make them competitive again in national elections.\n\nBut this isn't a costless strategy. In reaching for Latino voters-with greater support for immigration reform or redistributive policy-Republicans risk alienating core supporters in the white working class who associate immigration with economic insecurity. Which brings us to the second, and arguably dominant, camp. These reformers also believe that the GOP \"has been too dominated by corporate interests and needs to identify more directly with the economic frustrations of working-class voters,\" Gerson writes. Their solution, however, is a greater focus on the white working class. If a Republican could win 65 percent, or more, of the white vote, he would carry places such as Ohio and Iowa, as well as Democratic states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Not only does it make up for Colorado and Nevada, but it also makes up for Florida, another vital state where Latino voters are concentrated and critical to success.\n\nIn some ways, notes Gerson, Trump is the extreme version of this strategy. He speaks to the anxieties of working-class whites, channeling fear and discomfort with angry, belligerent nationalism. But there are other ways to make this pitch. In his successful campaigns for governor, Scott Walker mobilized huge numbers of supporters in the reddest counties of Wisconsin to win narrow victories over Democratic opponents.\n\nPart of this was raw partisanship-galvanizing conservative voters against unions and public employees. But part of it was playing the suburbs against the cities-Milwaukee in particular-and harnessing the racially polarized politics of the area. And on the stump in the Republican primary, notes the New York Times , Walker \"wins applause by noting his efforts to require drug tests of people receiving public assistance, and uses language reminiscent of old, loaded appeals about indolent welfare recipients.\" As one conservative writer told the Times , his is a \"populist strategy that doubles down on turning out disaffected white men.\"\n\nBut this brings us back to the second problem. The appeals the GOP uses to turn out disaffected whites-and maximize white support writ large-could backfire, both with Latinos and with other whites, who have nonwhite friends, neighbors, spouses, and partners and see themselves as tolerant. In working to maximize their share of the white vote, Republicans who take this path could lower their ceiling.\n\nIt's not clear that there's a way out of this dilemma. But if there is, his name is Marco Rubio. There's no evidence the Florida senator can pull Latinos back to the Republican Party, but as a young Spanish-speaking politician of Cuban descent, he projects the same cosmopolitanism of Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Even if he abandons immigration reform and tries to maximize the party's share of the white vote, he doesn't trigger the same anxieties from white voters as a more traditional politician might. Rubio bridges the gap between the two camps and lets the GOP change its look without changing its tune.\n\nRead more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Just Gave Texas a Green Light to Harass Every Latino Person in the State\n\nIn the manner of a drunk teenager with a hand on a light switch, the Supreme Court has spent the past few days turning federal immigration law in Texas on and off, on and off, while making mewling noises about whether it was on or off when the party started. In a 6-3 decision along the usual lines on Tuesday afternoon, the Supreme Court allowed S.B. 4-Texas' stunning usurpation of federal immigration law-to take effect. Through this divided and unreasoned vote, the high court will allow Texas to seize enforcement of immigration powers away from the federal government, a direct violation of a 2012 Supreme Court decision striking down Arizona's infamous \"show me your papers\" law. In so doing, the conservative majority has blessed galling chicanery by the Court of Appeals for the 5 th Circuit, which sought to shield Texas' law from Supreme Court review indefinitely. As two of the dissenters noted, the six justices in the majority have injected \"chaos and crisis in immigration enforcement\" through oblivious procedural formalism that does not withstand the slightest scrutiny.\n\nAs signed into law late last year, S.B. 4 criminalizes unauthorized migration under Texas law, thereby turning unlawful entry and presence in the U.S. into an offense separate and apart from existing federal immigration law. The Texas measure also allows state law enforcement officers to stop and detain anyone they \"suspect\" of having entered Texas unlawfully, while instructing state courts to disregard any ongoing federal immigration proceedings. It also allows state judges to begin deportation proceedings and permits state magistrate judges to remove migrants back to Mexico as an alternative to continued prosecution. (Those who cannot prove their legal status may be jailed or deported back to Mexico, whether or not they're Mexican.) This radical revision of immigration law will hinder migrants' ability to cross safely into the country and seek asylum once here. It will also subject Latinos, including citizens and permanent residents, to heightened suspicion and harassment by law enforcement.\n\nTexas justified S.B. 4 as a necessary exercise of Texas' constitutional authority to repel an \"actual invasion,\" an absurd claim with zero basis in law or fact . As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared , S.B. 4 embodies Texas' singular view that its constitutional authority \"is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary.\" All of this, as a federal district court in Texas noted last month , amounts to \"nullification of federal law and authority-a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.\" (Fact check: true .)\n\nAnd yet, shortly after that district court blocked S.B. 4 , the 5 th Circuit-and of course it was the 5 th Circuit-froze its injunction and let Texas enforce the new law from top to bottom. So the Department of Justice, joined by pro-immigration groups, asked SCOTUS for relief. While the full court mulled this request, Justice Samuel Alito kept the law on hold until Tuesday (with a four-minute lapse on Monday afternoon when he let it take effect, apparently by accident, for a short moment). After Tuesday's order, Texas can begin arresting people suspected of unauthorized presence in the country, interfering with migrants' ability to seek asylum, and removing residents to Mexico-a sovereign foreign nation that has not actually agreed to take back individuals deemed deportable by Texas.\n\nWe don't know why Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito voted to let S.B. 4 spring into action. But Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, proffered a weak excuse for the capitulation. The 5 th Circuit, she noted, did not issue a traditional stay of the district court's injunction (called a \"stay pending appeal\"), which the justices could review. Instead, the 5 th Circuit styled its order as an \"administrative stay.\" These stays are meant to briefly preserve the status quo while a court considers whether to issue more formal, lasting relief. SCOTUS does not typically look at mere administrative stays due to their fleeting and informal nature; it prefers to wait for a formal stay before jumping in. So the 5 th Circuit has begun to call its most controversial stays \"administrative,\" in a brazen bid to insulate them from probing Supreme Court review.\n\nOn Tuesday, it worked. Barrett called the 5 th Circuit's administrative stay \"an exercise of its docket-management authority,\" declaring that SCOTUS should not \"get into the business\" of reviewing \"a short-lived prelude to the main event.\" In other words, because the 5 th Circuit used the magic word administrative to describe its (indefinite) stay, Barrett refused to consider whether S.B. 4 should be kept on ice while the merits are reviewed. She simply rubber-stamped the 5 th Circuit's stay, rewarding its shameless gamesmanship. The only silver lining to this is that Barrett appears to recognize the broader pattern \"lurking\" here: defiant lower courts recasting stays as \"administrative\" to thwart Supreme Court review for months, with no endpoint in sight. \"The time may come, in this case or another, when this court is forced to conclude that an administrative stay has effectively become a stay pending appeal and review it accordingly,\" she tsked, sending a warning signal to the 5 th Circuit. \"But at this juncture in this case, that conclusion would be premature.\" (Barrett did not explain why SCOTUS did not just issue its own injunction against S.B. 4, as it undoubtedly could have.)\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor's sharp dissent, joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, was far less tolerant of the 5 th Circuit's duplicity. (Justice Elena Kagan also dissented, in a brief separate opinion, urging that an administrative stay not be used to \"spell the difference between respecting and revoking long-settled immigration law.\") Sotomayor noted that the 5 th Circuit \"recently has developed a troubling habit of leaving 'administrative' stays in place for weeks if not months,\" citing stays that dragged on for as long as 85 days. In reality, she explained, this benign-sounding tool has developed into an act of extreme judicial gaslighting. The administrative stay here, she wrote, \"not only upends the status quo but also extends that disruption indefinitely.\" In the process, it \"defeats the purpose of this court's stay analysis and threatens to evade effective review of this unprecedented law.\" This play is largely a repeat of S.B. 8, Texas' 2021 vigilante abortion ban, which SCOTUS allowed to take effect in the dark of night, without any reasoned analysis-after the 5 th Circuit froze a district court's injunction with (you guessed it) an administrative stay. (In her opinion on Tuesday, Barrett wrongly claimed that the Supreme Court has never reviewed an administrative stay, evidently forgetting the S.B. 8 fiasco.)\n\nHad the court called BS on the 5 th Circuit and applied its usual standards to the stay, Sotomayor correctly noted, it would have no choice but to halt S.B. 4. When you tot up the balance of alleged irreparable harms here, it isn't even a close call. On the one side of the ledger, Texas claims to suffer a temporary inability to repel an immigration \"invasion.\" On the other side, the federal government stands to suffer irreparable harm to its foreign relations, its international obligations to protect individuals fleeing from persecution or torture, and its ability to carry out legitimate immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, noncitizens face unimaginable harm now that Texas can arrest and deport them with zero regard for their rights under federal law. None of these evils can be readily unwound, and the Supreme Court had previously held unequivocally that states cannot arrogate the federal government's power over immigration policy and enforcement. These facts should have been reason enough for SCOTUS to block S.B. 4 immediately.\n\nReading the Barrett and Sotomayor opinions side by side, there is a bit less of a delta than you might assume. What's strange about Barrett's opinion is that she clearly recognizes the 5 th Circuit's bad behavior, yet suspends any appropriate response for the time being. A cynic might think Barrett knows that S.B. 4 is obviously unconstitutional but wants to punish the Biden administration for its allegedly lax border enforcement by letting the law kick in for a few weeks. Her opinion implicitly faults both parties, Texas and the federal government, and gives Texas a reprieve this time-to the detriment of immigrants, Latinos, and the basic principle of federal supremacy. \"If a decision does not issue soon, the applicants may return to this court,\" she cautioned the 5 th Circuit. In the meantime, cruelty and nullification will reign in Texas, but just for an indefinite while.\n\nA few short weeks ago, the high court announced that Colorado could not enforce Section 3 of the 14 th Amendment to keep an insurrectionist off the ballot because the result would be a \"patchwork\" of state laws and \"nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos.\" It now seems, though, that states eager to usurp federal prerogatives and foment chaos can just hang around the 5 th Circuit and seek extreme forms of relief in the wink-wink disguise of an \"administrative stay.\" Beware a high court that shows up telling you it's doing nothing, or empowering an appeals court to do nothing, as it fundamentally upends the balance of powers between state and federal authorities. These procedural manipulations have real-world consequences-namely, open season on people in Texas whom authorities deem to not \"look American.\" That heinous approach to immigration policy has only ever been the law in this country during America's most shameful eras. Now, thanks to the Supreme Court's obtuse inaction, it is again.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Schools Are Underserving Minority Communities, and Black and Latino Parents Have Noticed\n\nDigital Vision/Thinkstock\n\nDiversity isn't just a hallmark of big cities anymore. The U.S. as a whole is rapidly becoming a majority-minority country, starting with our youngest citizens: Last summer, the U.S. Census Bureau published a report on the changing demographics of the country and found that, as of 2014, 50.2 percent of American kids under the age of 5 are nonwhite-a shift that promises to transform American society more broadly in the decades to come.\n\nThat's why the \"New Education Majority\" poll from the Leadership Conference Education Fund is so important: because it directly asks the parents and caregivers of these no-longer-minority kids about their priorities and problems with the U.S. education system. The poll of 400 black and 400 Latino caregivers of varying income levels (the poll left out Asian American and Native American parents \"due to resource constraints\") found that most of these parents are aware of the well-documented race-based disparities in schools : 66 percent of black parents and 45 percent of Latino parents \"reject the notion that students in their communities receive as good an education as White students.\" They'd also like to see much higher expectations set for black and Latino students, including those from low-income communities.\n\nThe majority of the respondents who saw racial inequities in education cited \"lack of funding\" as the primary reason for these disparities. Eighty-three percent of black and 61 percent of Latinos polled don't believe that schools in black and Latino communities get the same funding as schools in white communities, and to the question of whether \"schools in low-income communities receive the same amount of funding as schools in wealthy communities,\" 84 percent of black and 77 percent of Latino respondents answered no.\n\nSo what do these communities prioritize most? A huge majority of this new majority (90 percent of blacks and 94 percent of Latinos) ranked high-quality teachers as an important quality of a great school. Seventy-six percent of black and 64 percent of Latino respondents thought that teachers needed to be more diverse-a recurring problem in American education -and a third considered it very important that \"teachers look like the students in the school.\"\n\nAnd at a time of year when the opt-out movement -which is still a predominantly white phenomenon -is getting so much press, most black and Latino families polled support standardized testing: Roughly 70 percent of parents in both groups believes in using \"yearly testing to help parents and teachers know how well children are doing,\" and over 60 percent of both black and Latino parents think it's important that students perform well on these tests. And while white parents fret over the amount of homework being heaped on their children, most black and Latino parents have the opposite complaint: 90 percent of black and 84 percent of Latino parents think that students should be \"challenged more to help ensure they are successful later in life.\"\n\nOverall, this data provides a startling look at how different racial and socioeconomic groups view our education system. Perhaps the most depressing statistic is that a third of the African-Americans and a quarter of the Latinos polled \"do not believe schools are really trying to educate students in their communities.\" As more and more minority groups fill our nation's classrooms, what can we do to even the separate-but-forever-unequal playing field? Now that's a question many very smart people have spent decades trying to answer.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden Has a Real Latino Problem\n\nWith just over six months before Election Day, the odds of a Joe Biden presidency are improving. Despite being unable to campaign in person, Biden has opened a comfortable national margin over President Donald Trump. He also leads in most battleground states, including Florida and Wisconsin . If he wins every state now leaning his way, Biden's Electoral College tally could be significantly larger that Trump's in 2016. It would be a resounding victory.\n\nStill, Hillary Clinton held a similar edge over Trump in the middle of the spring four years ago. To prevent a bitter surprise in the fall, Biden's campaign needs to focus on those demographics that remain skeptical of the former vice president. While the election's result might finally hinge on suburban voters, that holy grail of modern American politics, no group should concern Democrats more than Hispanics.\n\nA recent Latino Decisions poll reveals a clear enthusiasm gap among Latinos for both Biden and the 2020 election itself, with only 49 percent of registered voters currently committed to choosing Biden over Trump, and just six out of 10 planning to go to the polls in November. Compare that with black voters, who seem deeply committed to Biden's candidacy: In another recent poll , 65 percent said they would support Biden. While a mere 23 percent of Hispanic voters seem to be leaning toward Trump, the lack of interest Biden generates within a community already plagued by low voter turnout should be an immediate cause for alarm for the Democratic Party.\n\nWhat explains Biden's lack of appeal among Latinos? For Democratic consultant José Parra, former adviser to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, Biden's troubles began with the campaign's financial constraints during the primary. \"Biden was running a campaign on very tight budgets, so I assume that was reflected in not being able to invest in the Latino community,\" Parra told me. During the primaries, Bernie Sanders' campaign both outspent and outsmarted Biden's with Latinos. With outreach led by Texan strategist Chuck Rocha, Sanders invested early in Hispanic voters, setting up offices in various Latino enclaves in California, Iowa, and other early states and hiring organizers within the community. Rocha also had the political insight to focus on Sanders' immigrant heritage and refocus the candidate's Hispanic policy agenda away from immigration and onto health care, jobs, and the economy. The strategy worked . Sanders beat Biden by almost 30 percent among Latinos in California, and at least 33 percent in Nevada .\n\nI spoke with Rocha a few days ago from D.C., where he was having, by his own admission, a difficult time winding down from the commotion of a presidential campaign to the quiet of the coronavirus quarantine. He was eager to share some thoughts on Biden's Latino challenges. \"He was just not talking to them,\" Rocha said. \"They spent little time and money actually having a conversation with these voters.\"\n\nAnd \"these voters,\" as Rocha noted, are not just one bloc. \"Biden has had a hard time motivating young voters in general, and Latinos are just younger,\" Rocha told me. Among older Hispanic voters, Rocha suggested, Biden faces a different kind of challenge. \"With those who are older, who have voted in one or two cycles, there's still some Obama hangover with immigration policy,\" he said. \"Deportations are still fresh on many people's minds.\" At first, Biden was reluctant to distance himself from the controversial immigration policy of the first two years of the Obama administration. He finally did so in an interview with Jorge Ramos.\n\nRocha warned that Biden's current approach to campaigning from confinement is not reaching the Hispanic electorate. \"Biden is having webinars and getting endorsements and he's doing all the things that the status quo says you are supposed to do, but that's not how you talk to Latinos,\" he explained. \"You have to spend money, go have a conversation, and tell them why your policies are different from Barack Obama's.\"\n\nOf course, the problem is that Biden can't really \"have a conversation\" with anyone in person at the moment, Hispanic or otherwise. The solution, Rocha says, could come from Biden's long list of Hispanic surrogates. \"People like congressmen Tony Cárdenas and Ruben Gallego-there's a lot of members of the Hispanic caucus who are true champions of our community,\" Rocha told me. But Rocha thinks the Biden campaign still seems reluctant to properly invest in those surrogates: \"They don't spend money to get them out there in a mail piece or digital or television ads in Spanish, written by Latino consultants.\" Rocha compared this with how he took advantage of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's crucial backing of Bernie Sanders. \"Just her endorsement would have meant nothing,\" Rocha said. \"But taking her endorsement, making it into a television commercial in Spanish, and then delivering it to every Latino in Nevada or California-that's how you use a surrogate.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez is an interesting case study for the Biden campaign's sluggish Latino strategy. Rocha told me Sanders' internal polling consistently showed no Hispanic surrogate polled better than Ocasio-Cortez with Latinos, but also among coveted young, college-educated whites. Incredibly, according to Ocasio-Cortez herself, as of mid-April no one from the Biden campaign had reached out to her, and she had yet to speak to , let alone meet, the former vice president.\n\nThe Latino Decisions poll offers one possible key for Biden with Latino voters in the selection of his running mate. As the campaign's vetting process begins, Biden is said to be considering Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. An impressive 72 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to turn out in November if Biden chose Cortez Masto or another Hispanic woman like the Nevada senator as his vice presidential candidate. (It has to be a woman because Biden has already committed to picking a woman.) Even more important: 67 percent said such a selection would likely inspire them to support Biden at the polls. For Parra, the choice of a Hispanic woman like Cortez Masto would be a watershed moment for Hispanics. \"Seeing ourselves reflected in a national presidential ticket is something we've never experienced. It would probably be a game-changer,\" he told me. And Rocha notes that the selection of a Hispanic woman as a running mate would give Biden much-needed free media attention within the Latino community. \"If you were to pick Cortez Masto or [New Mexico Gov.] Michelle Lujan Grisham, the press covers it and it gets out to the masses,\" Rocha told me. \"That's how you move things.\"\n\nOne more thing: While his numbers are up and his absence from public view does lessen the chance that he will have a viral senior moment, Biden's hibernation has had another negative consequence for Biden. According to the Latino Decisions poll, almost half of all respondents approve of Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, with 47 percent saying Trump was delivering \"clear and helpful\" information about the pandemic. \"That is a function of Trump being in front of the cameras on a daily basis, a luxury Biden doesn't have,\" Parra told me. \"But the Biden campaign has room to improve in reaching out to Latino media in order to create a contrast. That has not happened yet.\" Rocha agrees: \"Hispanics are not hearing from anyone in the community except Donald Trump, every single day, for an hour of primetime news, talking about how he is fixing this.\" Without pushback in Spanish, Rocha says, Hispanics are left with Trump's narrative on the pandemic. \"There's nobody out there saying what he's doing to our community.\"\n\nIn spite of Biden's lackluster polling with Hispanics, both Parra and Rocha remain optimistic. \"He still has plenty of time to maximize the Latino vote, but it's going to take investment, paid communication to that community, and it needs to be done by Latinos,\" Rocha insists. Parra adds a warning: Don't assume Hispanics will show up just based on Trump's horrible treatment of the Hispanic community. The Biden campaign, he told me, should \"invest well in bicultural and bilingual talent who have a seat at the table in the campaign and who know the communities well.\" If Biden and his team stall, Latino voters could deliver, either through apathy or rejection, a loud enough rebuke come November.

      "text": "Who Saved the American City? And Who Almost Destroyed It?\n\nJust decades ago, American cities were in steep decline. Eighteen of the United States' 25 largest cities were smaller in 1980 than they were in 1950. Grim urban landscapes faced depopulation, high crime rates, municipal bankruptcies, and economic decline. Conventional wisdom says the \"creative class,\" some combination of bohemian artists followed by white-collar yuppies, deserves credit for reversing the tide, making downtowns attractive, if expensive, places to live, a reversal that dampened the congestion, alienation, and environmental catastrophe of the suburbs.\n\nNot so fast, says A.K. Sandoval-Strausz in his enchanting new book Barrio America . It was the arrival of Latino immigrants that stemmed the tide of population loss, he says, when they arrived in growing numbers in the 1970s. As Barrio America explains, Latino migrantes found affordable, aging housing stock in the neighborhoods that working-class whites fled, like Dallas' Oak Cliff and Chicago's Little Village. Many migrantes had never driven before-in 1960, Mexico had only one automobile for every 45 residents-and they preferred compact walking-friendly urban enclaves over sprawling suburbs. They brought panaderias , then, pupuserias , to aging storefronts, and invested their labor and money into rehabilitating the cityscape. During Chicago's 1995 heat wave, when temperatures rose to 106 degrees Fahrenheit, triggering the deaths of 517 residents, both Latinos and non-Latinos living in and around the barrios had much higher survival rates; Latinos had modified the built environment in a way that brought residents outside into the lifesaving fresh air.\n\nBarrio America offers a welcome narrative for our demoralizing political moment. As liberal alliances are torn apart by gentrification, isn't it soothing to imagine a version of urban renewal that isn't led by white tech workers who call the police for trespassing when neighbors of color enter their own homes ? Picking up Barrio America, I was heartened by the largely upbeat argument Sandoval-Strauz puts forth: He says he'll tell the story of an \"urban renaissance,\" centered on the oral histories of migrantes .\n\nBut the story Sandoval-Strausz ends up telling isn't a particularly happy one; this isn't \"immigrants, we get the job done,\" so much as \"white Americans, we will definitely destroy cities and prosperity if left to our own devices.\" It takes a full 160 pages of the book for Sandoval-Strausz to get to the part of the story where migrantes start showing up in large numbers-the book, until that point, is largely about what pushed white people out of the cities to begin with: \"the refusal of most whites to share the cities fairly with people of color.\" Through the 1950s, both Northern and Southern cities were fiercely segregated: by white residents willing resort to violence when their boundaries were threatened, and by white moderates and self-identified liberals in power who thought pacifying vocal racists was the best way to avoid chaos.\n\nThe white flight of the 1960s and 1970s was made possible, in part, because of rules and regulations that viewed Latino immigrants as \"acceptable buyers-that is those who were clearly not African American and whom city authorities were insisting were legally white.\" That ends up being the most critical point of Sandoval-Strausz' book: The nominal whiteness of Latinos let them access home mortgages and neighborhoods denied to black homebuyers during the mid-20 th century, giving them the chance to build thriving barrios, despite the discrimination by employers and police officers Latinos still faced. It's not the tidy narrative of immigrant exceptionalism we're often offered: It's something more disturbing, more interesting, and more important.\n\nSandoval-Strausz does a masterful job here of weaving together interviews with current and former residents of the barrios, along with language from newspapers and government reports from the past 60 years, to piece together how racial logic operates. It is not, per se, with sympathy that Sandoval-Strausz profiles people like the white real estate agent Richard Dolejs, who welcomed Latino immigrants into Chicago's Little Village with a Mexican Independence Day parade in 1964 while simultaneously participating in the system that kept black interlopers out of the neighborhood. Nevertheless, Sandoval-Strausz approaches Dolejs and others with enough patience to unpack how various threads of white supremacy evolved across time.\n\nConsider, for example, the government officials in Dallas, who, understanding that \"race riots were bad for business,\" made a movie in 1961 called Dallas at the Crossroads , showing schoolchildren, Boy Scouts, and a choir singing \"America the Beautiful,\" meant to gingerly convince white Dallas residents not to violently reject school desegregation. The film concedes that white people might prefer to avoid black people, but brings out a judge to remind everybody that \"the law is the law.\" As Sandoval-Strausz documents how white Americans moved to the suburbs to preserve their racial capital, it's the bizarrely hypocritical antics of business-minded moderates that really steal the show.\n\nBy A.K.

He goes on some especially long detours, and at times, it's easy to get lost in the vastness of the narrative-not because the writing is dry, but because the ambition of the book is grand. After all, in trying to tell the history of cities over 60 years, Sandoval-Strausz ends up describing nearly every important event and trend of the 20 th century, all through the lens of how they touched white, black, and Latino residents of American cities.\n\nAnd where are we now? Sandoval-Strausz tells the story of José Luis Arroyo, hanging out at home in Chicago's Little Village when a white guy knocks on his door, asking to buy his house. \"This was my father's house,\" the stranger explains, adding, \"I like it here. I was born in this neighborhood.\" The house isn't for sale, but that doesn't deter the stranger. When Arroyo asks him why his father left, the stranger says, \"I don't know why my father moved out, he just did.\" Immigrants invested in the neighborhoods white residents left behind, and now their children have returned, insisting on their rights to the city. Immigrants built something good, and now white Americans have come for it, with no memory of why they abandoned it in the first place.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The uncomfortable question about \"Latino\" voters\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIs the group too diverse to think of with just one word?\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight, Vox's member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today .\n\nWhat does \"Latino\" mean? And is there still such a thing as the \"Latino vote\"?\n\nAt first glance, both questions are simple to answer. Latinos are simply any of the 65 million people of any race living in the United States with cultural or ancestral ties to Latin America (and Spain, if you consider the term \"Hispanic\"). Overwhelmingly of Mexican descent (about 60 percent), they live primarily in two states, California and Texas, and make up about a fifth of the American population.\n\nThe \"Latino vote,\" meanwhile, could simply be those Latino Americans who vote in elections. More than 30 million of these people living in the US are citizens who can, and more than 16 million turned out in the 2020 election - the Latino electorate. These voters have tended to vote for Democrats in national elections, and, since 2004, have given near super-majorities of support to the Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nFor a time, this vote remained pretty uniform in both its makeup and its support for one party. That stability fueled the idea that there was such a thing as a Latino voting bloc, leading parties to have \"Latino strategies\" aimed at winning these voters over. They could be thought of as Black voters tended to be: reached with appeals to racial and ethnic solidarity, reminders of discrimination and inequality, and in turn expected to behave like Black voters - who, along with LGBTQ voters, have been Democrats' most loyal cohort.\n\nBy 2024, this assumption has been called into question. To say that Latinos are not a monolith is now a cliche - the basic starting point for conversations about how these Americans vote. But now, is even the term \"Latino\" itself an oversimplification?\n\nMany strategists, academics, and activists agree, saying the category of \"Latino\" is too vague and amorphous to capture its diversity of race, language, national origin, and immigrant experience. And when it comes to politics, it can flatten the political ideology, partisan loyalty, and changing vote preferences of millions of people across 50 states.\n\nThat idea is gaining momentum, but it's not universal. There are those who think the term has value, pointing out that it's still useful to have a broad and more visible descriptor for these people; its members are stronger together, and despite diversifying political views, still tend to behave in similar patterns.\n\nThe implications are big: For the last 40 years, political organizing, power building, and business interests have relied on there being such a thing as a Hispanic or Latino community to count, to mobilize, and to market to. In short: This quandary matters for anyone hoping to win the votes of tens of millions of people.\n\nThe best political example to stop thinking of Latinos as a bloc or collective is to see what has happened when campaigns have tried to appeal to them as a group. The outreach and persuasion operation that President Joe Biden's 2020 primary and general election campaigns ran is a prime example.\n\nIn 2020, that was the focal point of criticism of Democrats' Latino voter outreach. It was too generic, unsophisticated, and premised on outdated thinking about what matters to these voters: promises of immigration reform and humanitarian border policies for a community that was primarily native-born; reminders of Donald Trump's racism when these voters didn't necessarily think he was talking about them; and \" Hispandering \" with flourishes of Spanish and Latin celebrity endorsements when Spanish-language use rates were declining and those celebrities weren't necessarily relevant .\n\nThe most widely referenced example: When Biden campaigned in Florida with the Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, and bopped along to the star's hit song \"Despacito.\" It went viral - for the wrong reasons: seeming like a cringey last-ditch attempt to get in the good graces of a community he hadn't really been campaigning for.\n\nThat campaign continued to be a special target of this criticism for beginning outreach too late in the cycle, for not investing enough resources in persuasion and turnout efforts, for leaning too much on immigrant-friendly appeals in that pitch, and for missing just how damaging Republican attacks describing Democrats as \"socialists\" actually were. Biden still won a majority of these voters, but his results were a decline from the share of support Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had gotten in previous presidential cycles.\n\nThese approaches still fit within the old model of talking to and about a \"Latino vote\": one that assumed it could operate as a voting bloc, and it would remain monolithic. At one point in time, it was. But as rates of college education rise, as incomes grow, as the share of foreign-born Latinos declines, and as they vote differently, perhaps \"Latino\" should give way for more specific reference points, like \"Mexican American,\" \"Cuban American,\" \"Southwestern voters,\" or \"Florida Latinos\" - at least for the purposes of electoral politics.\n\nSince 2020, the conventional wisdom has settled on a more tailored, targeted approach - what some Democratic Latino strategists and aligned groups call \"culturally competent\" campaigning. In 2024, that became the bedrock of Biden and Harris's early and improved Latino outreach - what New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called a \"diaspora strategy.\"\n\n\"They care about the diasporas and looking at this from a diaspora strategy, as opposed to just an overall, monolithic strategy that we often hear discussed and unfortunately played out in a lot of different areas,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Politico in September. \"So I think that as time goes on, we're going to see the results of that more refined approach.\"\n\nOn the ground, that looked like tailored ads and campaign contact for Puerto Rican and Dominican communities in Pennsylvania and Florida, for Mexican Americans in the Southwest, and for using different surrogates, accents, and vocabulary in different media markets. After all, the thinking goes, what might sound familiar and credible to a first-generation naturalized Mexican American voter in Las Vegas is different from what appeals to the third-generation Puerto Rican voter who did not have to go through the same immigrant experience, even if they both speak Spanish.\n\nRepublicans performed their own version of this new identity politics between the 2020 and 2024 cycles - but it looked very different.\n\nInstead of appealing to a broad \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" vote, they doubled down on specific segments of the electorate in an attempt to chip away at Democratic dominance. They played up the specter of \"socialism,\" \"communism,\" and \"Marxism\" in both Trump's and other down-ballot candidates' appeals to Cuban and Venezuelan American voters in Florida. It's here where one 2020 jingle that was recycled for the 2024 cycle stands out: A Cuban band's \"Latinos for Donald Trump\" salsa song that went viral four years ago was used by Trump's campaign this year to double down on a segment of the Latino electorate they thought was already likely to surge for him at the polls.\n\nThey paired this with talk of the threat that illegal immigration posed to Mexican Americans and their safety in border communities in the Southwest in order to reach Trump-friendly working-class voters in Arizona, Nevada, and Texas - a mirror image of the traditional Democratic appeal to working-class, first- or second-generation Latinos.\n\nThese varying, hyper-specific approaches all demonstrated two things: Campaigning to \"Latinos\" was falling out of vogue - the preference now was for direct appeals to subset within the bloc. And the Latino electorate was now large, complex, and varied enough to be examined and treated with the same degree of sophistication as white voters are.\n\nIf Biden's 2020 run suggested it was a mistake to think of Latinos as a broad, workable category, Trump's 2024 victory suggests that maybe you can.\n\nEven if the Latino category is too diverse, and doesn't function as a monolithic voting bloc, reality suggests they still behave as a group. That's the conclusion of early analysis conducted by the Latino research firm Equis, which found that the rightward shifts of these voters in the 2024 cycle cut across geographical location, population size, and country of origin.\n\n\"Broad-based shifts like these challenge the use of provincial theories to explain them,\" Equis co-founder Carlos Odio wrote in sharing those results.\n\nThe implication? It might make theoretical and intellectual sense to think of and appeal to these voters with specificity and fragmentation. But as a whole, a broader category of people united by similar experiences as a minority in the US, primarily nonwhite, and which continues to assimilate, still exists on the ground.\n\nThose similar experiences, some shared language, and growth across the country do make this cohort of people distinct from non-Hispanic white, Asian, and Black people - and therefore it makes sense to organize, mobilize, and campaign for the votes of these communities. That's the premise that led to the formation of specific Hispanic- and Latino-focused advocacy groups and political organizations, and which continues to warrant specific data collection, policy work, fundraising, investment, and political outreach from institutions, businesses, politicians, and campaigns.\n\nIn practice, across race, age, and gender, this group is still also mostly motivated by a similar set of priorities and concerns. When asked about issues that might affect their vote in 2024, the overwhelming majority of these voters described economic anxiety. Immigration tended to follow - and for similar reasons: They were upset by the status quo of the post-pandemic migrant crisis . Though they may be becoming more of a swing voter group, by most metrics they are still siding with Democrats at higher rates than white voters. And above all, a majority of these people still conceive of themselves as distinctly either \" Hispanic\" or \"Latino .\"\n\nIn other words, we're overcomplicating this question. Whether \"Latino\" is still useful in the political realm reminds me of something the sociologist G. Cristina Mora, who has traced the history of the \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" labels,\" told me back in 2021.\n\n\"Sometimes people want to [say] that somehow Latinos are so different, like, 'Oh my god, they're too diverse!' Like, 'Latinos are not a thing.' How is white a thing? How is Black a thing? How is Asian a thing? Somehow people think that there's something really uniquely diverse and special and in many ways we're the same as others,\" she told me then. \"We've never just had one term that everyone was into, we've never had one term that everyone's happy with.\"\n\nFor the never-Trump strategist Mike Madrid, the ambiguity is the point. \"Latino\" as a multiracial category distinct from the binary \"white\" and \"Black\" challenges both the nation's political class and the greater American public to realize just how quickly the US is moving into a primarily multiracial, Latino-driven future. It might not be a label that is useful forever, but it's useful now for carving out a distinct category of people who deserve attention.\n\n\"To talk about us as 'Mestizo' [someone of Spanish and indigenous ancestry in Latin America] is more appropriate maybe than 'Latino,' but we are multiracial and there has to be a new language for that that doesn't necessarily fit in this black and white paradigm,\" Madrid told me.\n\nFor now, the \"Latino\" label doesn't face the prospect of sliding out of relevance or usage soon, even if talk about the \"Latino vote\" seems to be on the decline.\n\nSure, as this category of voters continues to assimilate, enmesh itself into the fabric of the nation, and change the nation just as we are being changed, Hispanic and Latino identity itself will change. Labels don't stick around forever.\n\nAnd that's where the challenge of defining \"Latino\" and \"Latino voters\" suggests something more uncomfortable too: The idea of Hispanic-ness, Latinidad, is likely to change quickly in the next two decades. Rates of interracial marriage continue to remain high; the role of Spanish continues to decline; US-born Latinos are driving the growth of this part of the population; and ideological sorting within this part of the electorate appears to be increasing . That suggests to political parties, and those seeking power, that they can't rest easy thinking alignments or realignments will stick around forever. But it also means \"Latinoness\" stands to lose its distinctiveness in the near future.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Latino surge for Republicans in the Trump era is real. Democrats need to adjust.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nAmong the questions that stumped strategists, journalists, and pundits in the aftermath of the 2022 midterm elections - one in which Democrats surprisingly overperformed - was one big mystery: What happened to the much-hyped \"red wave\" of Latino Republican voters that was supposed to realign American politics?\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump's success with Latino voters in 2020, analysts expected a continuation of the same in 2022. But early clues suggested a more complicated picture . Republicans won Latino voters for the first time in 15 years in Florida; close races in the Southwest ended up tipping toward Democrats; and most of Texas's majority Mexican American border districts did not flip.\n\nHalf a year later, we have even more answers - and they confirm something that some establishment Democrats and many party operatives need to wrestle with: Republicans did make gains in 2020 with Latino voters, those gains did stick in 2022, and they could still grow in 2024.\n\nIn other words, Democrats did better than expected in 2022 despite signs that their Latino support could continue to erode - signs they can't afford to ignore heading into an election year.\n\nLast week, Equis, a progressive research organization focused on understanding Latino voting trends, released a 130-page midterm postmortem analyzing the \"Trump-era shift\" of Latinos to the right in battleground states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin.\n\nWhat they found: Republicans held on to the gains they made since 2016 (the recent low point of GOP Latino support) but did not exceed their 2020 high point (aside from Florida, which stands out as the national exception in all of this analysis). Democrats, meanwhile, didn't do worse than they did in 2020 (and managed to improve in places like Arizona and Pennsylvania).\n\nIt's a nuanced portrait but one in which Democrats may have more to be worried about. The hangover of the 2020 rise in Latino support for the GOP even after the Trump years still haunts many Democratic Party officials, strategists, candidates, and campaigns. Some seem unwilling to accept that a new Latino political landscape has emerged, one that requires a different campaign strategy and platform from what we saw in the last presidential election .\n\nEquis's report shows that despite the unique political environment of 2022 (high inflation, gas price shocks, and an unpopular president), Democrats were able to out-campaign and outspend Republicans to win competitive elections - but still weren't able to push beyond the new baseline of Republican Latino support (about 40 percent). Meanwhile, Republicans failed to turn out Latino voters who sided with them on the issues. It's those nonvoters that should worry Democrats looking ahead.\n\n\"Those who didn't vote in 2022 are the biggest wildcard this next cycle,\" Equis's team writes. \"Swing Latinos still seem to default to [Democrats] but are open to individual Republicans, with greater support possible when there is a major shift in the issue environment, imbalanced campaigning, or a weakening of identity bonds.\"\n\nThese findings are important for the parties, their candidates, and their supporters to understand just how much the electorate and political environment have changed since the start of the Trump years. Some in the Democratic apparatus have questioned how real the Latino shift is and how much of Democrats' losses can be ascribed to \" misinformation \" (spoiler alert: not much). A better picture of just how fluid these voters are can help Democrats fashion a new playbook - one that sees a much bigger role for persuasion than past campaigns.\n\nThe Equis postmortem is the third analysis of its kind that the progressive research firm has published to try to explain how Latino voters behaved in major elections. The first two, released in spring and winter of 2021 respectively, confirmed the rightward shift of Latino voters after the 2020 election, despite debate over where those shifts happened and how big they were.\n\nThe new report confirms much of what the Democratic data firm Catalist , another reputable source for election analysis, found earlier this year, and it matches the trends reported in exit polling from last year.\n\nEquis's report breaks down three ways to understand what happened with Latino voters in battleground states last year: the issues dominating the national conversation (inflation, abortion, immigration, democracy), the way candidates campaigned, and the brand strength of the two political parties going into and emerging from Election Day.\n\nIt also identifies what might be the two most important types of Latino voters for campaigns to think of going into 2024: the swingy, \"highly conflicted\" voter, who supports Democrats on some issues and Republicans on others; and the non-voter, who might have only voted in 2020 or who voted in 2020 and the 2018 midterms but sat 2022 out.\n\nThose first three factors - issue environment, campaign efforts, and party brand - explain why the support for both parties remained stable from 2020 to 2022. Republicans may have had an edge on inflation and the economy, but they failed to turn it into actual votes. Meanwhile, Democrats managed to not just turn out those voters who trusted Democrats with the economy, but also convince those who were divided in their trust to pick Democrats at the voting booth.\n\nDemocrats also won big with voters primarily concerned with abortion and the future of democracy. And, outside of Florida, Democrats also won more swing Latino voters: those \"highly conflicted\" voters who are less engaged with politics, less ideological, and have low allegiance to either party.\n\nThis all happened as Democrats outspent and out-campaigned Republicans (again, everywhere except for Florida), and as Democrats continued to be seen as the party that \"cares about people like you\" and was \"better for Hispanics.\" Issue selection and candidate quality mattered hugely. In Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly won over a significant number of conservative and moderate Latinos, while his rival Blake Masters just got more unpopular as he became better known.\n\nIn Nevada, meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto outspent her Republican opponent Adam Laxalt, despite his significant investments in Spanish-language media throughout most of the campaign, and picked the more effective issues to highlight (gas prices and health care costs over Laxalt's focus on crime).\n\n\"What sticks out among conflicted voters is what sticks out across every kind of 'swing' voter,\" the report reads. \"The enduring sense that Democrats care more and are better for [Hispanics/Latinos] ... [seems] to win out even as Republicans gain ground on other dimensions.\"\n\nThis Democratic brand proved resilient everywhere except Florida - and this data point is emblematic of just how difficult it will be for statewide Democrats to be competitive in a state that feels less like a true battleground with each passing year. Among all kinds of Florida's Latino voters in 2022, but especially among non-Cuban Americans and Puerto Rican Latinos, Democrats were viewed less favorably than they were outside of the state. That negative brand should give national Democrats pause when deciding just how hard they should try to contest the state in 2024.\n\nBut amid the good news for Democrats holding their own in 2022 (beyond Florida) are warning signs about what looms in 2024 and potential clues as to how the party should approach that election.\n\nThose voters who sat out 2022 will be among the majority-makers for 2024. They hold mixed values (likely to trust Republicans on inflation but perceive the party negatively on abortion and as favoring the rich), and may now be tilting toward Republicans. Equis's post-election polling shows Republicans have a big advantage with 2020 voters who sat out the midterms, and plenty of room to grow with GOP candidates who aren't Donald Trump.\n\nShould those 2020 voters who sat out 2022 vote in 2024, they would break for a Republican 54 percent and 34 percent for Biden, according to Equis. Adding to these early warning signs is a recent Axios-Ipsos/Telemundo poll further showing erosion in the positive branding and allegiance Democrats have enjoyed from most Latinos, driven mostly by economic and public safety concerns. This all means that even if Trump is the nominee, he could still improve on his 2020 showing.\n\nThis analysis is only the latest contribution in a long-running debate in Democratic politics: whether turnout or persuasion will win elections. The turnout camp suggests that there's an untapped well of voters out there; Democrats just need to find them and get them to the polls. The persuasion side argues that Democrats need to convince uncommitted voters and those loosely affiliated with the GOP to cast a ballot for them.\n\nThe Equis report notes both are important, but comes down firmly on the latter side. Those 2022 non-voters and the \"highly conflicted\" swing voters who ended up backing Democrats are persuadable voters who need to be engaged early on and who might not hold the same views on key issues that Democrats might assume from their generic base of voters.\n\nFor Equis, that means 2024 might create different imperatives for presidential and down-ballot races - but both kinds will have to put a bigger emphasis on persuasion.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"We're trying to normalize that Georgia is no longer Black and white.\"\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nThe Georgia Senate runoff elections on Tuesday will determine which party controls the Senate - and the future of President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. Latino voters could represent an important, if overlooked, coalition in those races that could push the Democratic candidates over the edge.\n\nNearly 10 percent of the state's population is Latino, and that share is growing quickly, mostly on account of US-born Latinos who are the children of immigrants. Some 377,000 Latinos are eligible to vote, making up 5 percent of the potential electorate, and 270,000 are registered. About 80,000 have requested absentee ballots for the Senate runoffs, and almost 70,000 already voted early. Given that the races will likely be decided by a razor-thin margin, their votes could make the difference.\n\nThe American Election Eve Poll from Latino Decisions suggested that, in November, a majority of Latino voters backed Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is challenging Republican David Perdue. And in a crowded field, a plurality supported Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by the governor in December 2019 after her predecessor retired.\n\nMost polls underestimated GOP performance this cycle, so Democrats' actual margins among Latinos may be smaller. Exit poll data also suggests that the Democratic candidates still had a significant edge among Latinos, though this kind of data is sometimes even less reliable .\n\nTurnout among Latinos also seemed to be up, from 33 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in November, according to an analysis by Emory University professor Bernard Fraga and the left-leaning voter analysis firm Catalist. Turnout typically decreases for runoff elections by an average of about 35 percent , but with so much national attention on these races, turnout is just 22 percent lower than it was in November based on early voting numbers alone.\n\nWith all signs pointing to Latinos casting decisive votes in the runoffs, Democrats have amped up their outreach efforts. Former Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro - the only Latino in the 2020 field - has campaigned with Ossoff . And national left-leaning Latino groups, including Mijente and grassroots organizations that have been working to mobilize Latino voters in Georgia for years, have been canvassing, sending mailers to Latino homes, texting hundreds of thousands of voters, and putting up billboards in places where there isn't significant Spanish-language media penetration.\n\n\"We're trying to normalize that Georgia is no longer Black and white,\" said Gigi Pedraza, executive director of the Latino Community Fund, one of the grassroots organizations working to turn out Latino voters in the state. \"Georgia is home to a multicultural, multiethnic, multilingual community that's young and vibrant and growing. It's an asset for the state.\"\n\nDemocrats are currently reevaluating their Latino outreach strategy in the wake of President-elect Joe Biden's underperformance among Latinos in Texas and Florida , both states where they make up a significant portion of the electorate, as compared to Hillary Clinton's support from Latinos in 2016. But many of the factors that led to that erosion in Latino support - including a successful right-wing, Spanish-language disinformation campaign and a tradition of voting Republican - don't exist to the same extent in Georgia.\n\nRather, the characteristics of the mostly Mexican Latino population in Georgia are favorable for Democrats. Latinos in the state are comparatively young: More than a third are under 18, and about 20,000 Georgia Latinos turn 18 every year, becoming eligible to vote. Their communities are also concentrated in the Atlanta metro area, particularly in Gwinnett and Cobb counties, which are Democratic strongholds.\n\nWhat's more, many of them have a connection to the immigrant experience and have consequently mobilized against the GOP's restrictive stance on immigration, particularly in the Trump era. As of 2018, roughly 10 percent of Georgia residents were immigrants, many of them naturalized citizens, and 7 percent were native-born US citizens with at least one immigrant parent. Roughly 400,000 people in Georgia are undocumented immigrants.\n\nThat shows in terms of Georgia Latinos' political priorities: Immigration ranks third in importance after the US's response to the pandemic and the economy, according to focus groups conducted by the Democratic Nuestro PAC. By comparison, the issue never made the top five in any other state in the general election.\n\nBut while these voters got behind Democrats in the November election in Georgia, the biggest challenge for organizers is communicating why their community needs to show up again for the Senate runoffs.\n\nChuck Rocha, a former senior adviser on Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign and the founder of Nuestro PAC, said he is focused on increasing Latino turnout, rather than persuading voters to change their minds.\n\n\"We're learning that Latinos don't understand why the hell they need to come back and vote again after they just finished voting,\" he said. \"They were voting against Donald Trump predominantly.\"\n\nHis PAC is consequently running Spanish-language ads in the Atlanta media market explaining that control of the Senate hinges on these two runoffs and how voters can go about casting their ballot.\n\nBut he worries the Democratic Party and other outside groups aren't doing enough to reach out to Latino voters in the same way. They have invested heavily in improving canvassing and ground operations in Latino communities, and Warnock and Ossoff have been appearing on Spanish-language media and have hired campaign staff from Latino communities.\n\nBut Democrats have not put money toward advertising on Spanish-language media. The party and the donor infrastructure is spending $400 million on Georgia media, but none of that has gone to Latino organizations, Rocha said.\n\n\"This is a fatal mistake that Democrats can never learn to fix, which is Latinos listen to the TV, the radio, and get on the internet, just like white people. Why are you not investing in a multilayered approach?\" he said. \"We have to learn the lesson that ground operations is just one of the techniques that you use and an important technique to reach Latino voters.\"\n\nGeorgia voting rights activist Stacey Abrams has credited a robust network of Black, Asian, and Latino voting advocates who have been working to mobilize their communities for years with turning Georgia blue.\n\nThe success of the Latino organizers can be seen in this year's election of two Democratic sheriffs in Gwinnett and Cobb counties, where Latinos are concentrated.\n\nThe election of these sheriffs, who made cutting ties with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement a central message of their campaigns, is considered a triumph for immigrant rights activists. They have promised to end longstanding agreements with the federal government - known as 287(g) agreements after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that created them - under which sheriffs can question people about their immigration status and detain them on immigration charges.\n\nIn Gwinnett County, Democrat Keybo Taylor, a police major, prevailed over Republican Chief Deputy Sheriff Lou Solis. The county's 287(g) agreement had been used to refer more than 21,000 people in the county to ICE over the past decade, making it one of ICE's biggest local law enforcement partners outside of counties on the US-Mexico border.\n\nIn Cobb County, Democrat Craig Owens, also a police major, ousted incumbent Republican Sheriff Neil Warren, who has held office for 17 years and was the first sheriff in the state to enter into a 287(g) agreement.\n\nLatino advocates are continuing to invoke immigration as a means of energizing voters. The Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials (GALEO), which has registered more than 35,000 voters over the past couple of years, has pushed for a pathway to citizenship for the state's undocumented immigrants. And in partnership with the Latino Community Fund of Georgia, the organization has fought for more protections for undocumented workers who face exploitative labor practices.\n\n\"We have always been here,\" Pedraza said. \"Don't forget about us. Only folks that were outside Georgia were surprised [by the] runoff. We knew in Georgia all along, though, there was going to be a runoff.\"\n\nLatino advocates have focused their efforts on increasing turnout. But that task has been made more difficult by the closures of polling locations in the counties where Latinos tend to live, including Cobb County in the Atlanta metro area. Chatham, Forsyth, and Hall counties have also slashed polling locations.\n\nCobb County, which is 13 percent Hispanic or Latino , announced last month that it was reducing the number of available locations for early voting in the Senate runoffs, which began on December 14. Instead of the 11 locations that were open during the general election in November, there would be just five, officials said. That's despite record turnout in the county in November, leading to lines at the polls that had voters waiting for up to 10 hours.\n\nOrganizations including the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and the Georgia NAACP consequently warned that closing more than half of the early voting locations would disproportionately harm Black and Latino communities.\n\n\"Georgia's Black and Latinx residents are more likely to live in poverty than other residents and will have more difficulty traveling long distances to access advance voting locations, especially because of the limited public transportation options in Cobb County,\" the organizations wrote in a letter last month. \"As a result, the elimination of advance voting locations will discourage or prevent many of Cobb County's Black and Latinx voters from participating in the runoff election.\"\n\nAs a result, the county agreed to move one site and add two more in the last week of early voting. But advocates nevertheless reported that lines at the polls have been long, in some cases with waiting times as high as two hours .\n\nBut getting to the polls is not the only obstacle Latinos face in casting their vote. Georgia has an \"exact match\" signature requirement, which requires that the name on your voter registration match what is on your driver's license, and what is on file with the Social Security Administration. But under that system, naturalized citizens are inaccurately flagged as noncitizens if they obtained a Georgia driver's license prior to becoming citizens, often resulting in their voter registration applications being put on hold until they can prove their citizenship or even being canceled. GALEO has consequently sued.\n\n\"Officials that don't like the outcome of what happened [in November] are trying to suppress the votes,\" Jerry Gonzalez, GALEO's chief executive officer, said in a press call. \"It's not by accident.

White Latinos are bristling.\n\nby Izzie Ramirez\n\nAs viewers return to the futuristic, fictional country of Wakanda, the latest Black Panther movie is once again the focus of complicated and heated discussions about representation. Except this time, casting decisions have run headlong into the knotty politics of Latino representation.\n\nWhile most American audiences see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever as a win for Black and Latino communities - with the introduction of underwater king Namor played by Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta Mejía - the reaction in Mexico has been much bumpier. Last month, newscasters for Mexico's ADN40 channel complained that the movie's focus on darker-skinned Latino actors is a form of discrimination against white Latinos.\n\n\"The only thing they achieve is to separate people more,\" said host Vaitiare Mateos in Spanish. \"The people in a production must be selected for their talent and not for their skin color.\"\n\nFor centuries, colorism, or the discrimination against those with darker skin tones within the same group, has haunted Latino communities across the Americas. The echoes of the Spanish caste system still impact everything from health outcomes to job opportunities . That violent history is something that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tries to address; the characters portrayed by Latinos are intended to be Mesoamerican and that's key to the story, which grapples with the horrors of colonialism.\n\n\"The people in a production must be selected for their talent and not for their skin color\"\n\nNamor and his Talokan countrymen are connected to the Maya and Aztec cultures , and to a time before the Spanish were able to systematically oppress Mesoamerican people and their lands. To escape smallpox and certain death, the Talokanils went underwater (with the help of an in-world magic plant). There, they shielded themselves from slavery.\n\nIt's important to note here that Latinos are not a monolithic group. There are Indigenous and Black Latinos as well as mixed and white ones. There are also Indigenous groups who don't identify as Latino at all but live in Latin American countries. The Black Panther actors do not all identify as Indigenous, but some do have Indigenous or mixed ancestry. (Most Indigenous groups agree, though, that to identify as Indigenous requires more than a distant ancestor - there has to be lived experience and community acceptance. ) Regardless, to cast white Latinos as the Talokanils wouldn't have been the right call.\n\nThe ADN40 clip is now going viral on TikTok, where creators are highlighting how, within Latin media, lighter-skinned (especially white) actors are cast at much higher rates than darker ones. If you grew up on telenovelas, you would know that the lead characters were almost always green- or blue-eyed, and anyone who was a \"moreno\" would be relegated to goofy sidekicks or nosy maids. American entertainment, too, comes with its own typecasting of Latinos.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, fretting about representation in corporate superhero movies might seem like misplaced attention. But colorism is a nasty disease within Latino communities, in the US and elsewhere. It's a multilayered problem that for so long has been pushed to the side or ignored. We have a chance to hash that out now.\n\nAs Angie Gutierrez, a political science professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who teaches a course on the politics of Latino identity, said, \"Going forward, if we want to really address this, we're going to have these difficult conversations.\"\n\nFirst thing's first: spoilers are ahead. If you haven't seen the movie and you decide to keep reading, that's on you. (Or you can skip this section!)\n\nWhile Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is primarily about grief, it's also about forging and failing to find solidarity. The premise, more or less, is that ever since the now-deceased King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed Wakanda's wealth and strength to the rest of the world, other nations clamor for their primary resource: vibranium, a super-powerful (fictional!) metal. Because Wakanda, rightfully, does not trust these other countries, they refuse to share it, leading to attempts at theft and mining of the ocean floor. That's where Tenoch Huerta Mejía's character, Namor, comes in.\n\nNamor - the leader of Talokan, an underwater Mesoamerican society - approaches Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) after his people dismantled an American-made vibranium detector. Like Wakanda, Talokan is vibranium-rich, and has spent centuries keeping this a secret from other nations. Namor pleads for help and political allyship (read: Please kill the scientist who is responsible for the detector) out of desire to protect the Talokanils, who had already escaped colonialism's trenches. When things go sideways, the two nations are pitted against each other, despite their shared appreciation for one another.\n\nHowever, this is not the \"separation\" that the ADN40 hosts and other white Latinos are upset about. In their eyes, the controversy lies with the fact that Marvel only cast darker-skinned Latinos with Indigenous features or who are Indigenous themselves. There are several layers to this knee-jerk reaction of \"forced inclusion,\" said Alejandra Chávez Menendez, a Mexico City-based DEI consultant for LMF Network . According to her, the historical intertwining of classism, racism, and colorism has led to a response rooted in discomfort.\n\n\"The stories that we watch have been framed from a white-, male-, straight-centric viewpoint,\" said Chávez Menendez. \"So when things deviate from that, the first reaction is rejecting that because we're just not used to it.\"\n\n\"The stories that we watch have been framed from a white-, male-, straight-centric viewpoint\"\n\nHuerta Mejía has spoken several times about the perception of white Latinos around casting decisions in Latin America. In a June interview with Vice, he told reporter Emily Green about the hurdles he has faced in Mexico when pursuing roles. \"They need thieves, they need kidnappers, they need whores,\" he told Vice. \"So they call the brown-skinned people to make them. And we fit under that stereotype. They are always calling me to make the same character. It's the bad guy - always. But I always make a different version. Because for me, it's a person. I create a new personality, a new character each time.\"\n\nNamor, for sure, breaks some of those stereotypes, despite being the \"bad guy.\" Like Killmonger before him, Namor is strong, sympathetic, and sexy. He's powerful and admirable, with a deep sense of loyalty. He's not meant to be seen as entirely evil. And even with his miscalculations, it's hard to walk away from watching the movie without sharing Namor's sense of pride in what he has built for his people.\n\nIn the US, Latino roles are hard to come by. Only around 8 percent of roles in American movies go to Latino actors, according to a 2022 Hollywood diversity report , conducted by the University of California Los Angeles. Huerta Mejía is not the first Latino Marvel character; Salma Hayek and Xochitl Gomez, who are both Mexican, had key roles in Eternals and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , respectively. The Star Wars franchise, too, had Pedro Pascal, Oscar Isaac, Diego Luna, and Benicio del Toro. Yet, even in American media, these roles tend to go to those with lighter skin. Huerta Mejía's casting, alongside Yalitza Aparicio in the 2018 film Roma , has been indicative of a recent push to include morenos and indígenas.\n\n\"Representation is not about just having Latinos with dark skin up on screen,\" Chávez Menendez said. \"It's not just about having them or a quota. It's about the type of roles.\"\n\nIt's easy to apply an American lens to discrimination; there is so much of it there. But to truly understand the ugliness that has emerged in the aftermath of the movie's release, it's necessary to untangle the differences in the way colonialism was executed.\n\nIn what later became the United States, Anglo-Saxon colonizers wanted to kill and erase the \"Indians\" who were living there in order to create a sanctuary for white Protestants, said Niria Alicia, a Xicana Indígena community organizer and climate activist. \"It was a very Puritan way of colonization where they didn't mix, versus what happened in Latin America,\" Alicia said.\n\nThe Spanish, who were coming to Mesoamerica from Spain, had already experienced intercultural and racial mixtures via the Moors and other racial groups. So they then mixed with Indigenous and Black peoples, sometimes violently, and imposed a caste system to subjugate others, with white people at the top.\n\n\"In their mixture, they could still favor whiteness by creating those caste categories,\" said Alicia. \"They couldn't just so easily get rid of everybody. They had to make sure that they put [those groups] at the bottom of the pyramid and reminded them that that's where they belong.\"\n\nThe caste system still lingers today but is intentionally ignored and denied by Latin American countries. A large part of that is because ignoring differences was fundamental to creating a national identity when so many countries were fighting for independence against Spain. In Mexico, specifically, nation builders claimed that everyone was mestizo: To be Mexican is to be mixed. The myth of mestizaje was born.\n\nAnd while, yes, most people are mixed (myself included), what happens when there is no explicit addressing of the structural inequities caused by centuries of colorism is that it becomes accepted classism.\n\n\"In the case of Mexico, if they see people with darker skin color or from Indigenous communities, it's more likely they'll be less educated, come from low-income backgrounds, and probably have less opportunity for social mobility,\" said Chávez Menendez. \"This feeds into classism, which is differentiating access and treatment of people based on your socioeconomic background.\"\n\nDiscussions around the reality of economic and social outcomes - in addition to things like representation - has led to a sense of defensiveness for people who have benefited from a culture of silence, like the news anchors at ADN40.\n\n\"This forces us to reckon with 500 years of violent history where white Latinos are getting to see the violence of the caste systems that their ancestors were responsible for creating,\" Alicia said. \"It also forces us to reckon spiritually with how unsuccessful colonizers were in their attempts to eradicate us and forever make us inferior to them. They now have to reckon with our power and their unsuccessful genocidal efforts.\"\n\nFor the record: If white Latinos don't see themselves in the Talokans, they can still find plenty of representation with the Spanish colonizers, who are depicted in an accurately unflattering light.\n\nSince white Latino newscasters have opened the can of worms that is colorism and separation in Latino communities, it's worth finally talking about the other problems wriggling around. There's the representation the actors bring - which is good and challenging around discussions about colorism - and then there's the representation the Talokanil characters bring. \"It really isn't just a matter of descriptive representation in terms of having someone like me, but having those viewpoints actually reflected back,\" said Gutierrez, the UT professor. \"That's what's crucial.\"\n\nThat's where Black Panther could use more attention and criticism. To an American audience, the Talokanil can feel exciting since it seems like they \"survived\" colonialism and \"maintained\" their culture. But that falls into a trope of situating Indigenous peoples in the past tense. There are millions of Indigenous peoples living in Latin America. The Maya, which the movie draws heavy inspiration from, still exist. (I am no authority on the depiction of Indigenous groups, but I have to expect that creating the Talokanil from an amalgamation of cultures will probably lead to a flattening of those respective groups in the collective American understanding).\n\n\"It's the neocolonial tactics ... they just have to feed us these stories that we are each other's enemies, and then we do the dirty job for them\"\n\nThere's also, frankly, the race war of it all; the Talokanil versus the Wakandans. While this conflict does resolve itself, more or less, there's something to be said about how the pressure from Western, predominantly white nations creates an environment where colonized peoples feel like they have to fight each other for resources or support. As Alicia told me, \"It's the neocolonial tactics of they no longer have to, you know, beat us and kill us - they just have to feed us these stories that we are each other's enemies, and then we do the dirty job for them.\"\n\nI don't think a Disney movie will ever fully be able to grapple with that dynamic well. This isn't the primary concern around the film, but it does seem like a more legitimate line of complaint than \"not enough white Mesoamericans.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a movie operating within an American paradigm and understanding of world cultures. It's not going to revolutionize the way Latinos talk about other Latinos or about Indigenous peoples on its own. If we really want to create better futures, not just in fiction but in real life, we need to rip off the bandage around colorism ourselves.\n\n\"The first step to move the needle is acknowledging the problem and that racism and classism in Mexico and Latin American countries exist,\" Chávez Menendez, the DEI expert, said. \"Then challenging [yourself] to set the tone - that's a hard one because it's about getting uncomfortably honest with yourself.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Michelle Hackman\n\nLatino voters have captured the imagination of many a presidential candidate. Winning the allegiance of these voters, whose numbers have swelled to a projected 27 million in 2016, is now perceived as essential to cobbling together a winning coalition to take the White House.\n\nThat's partially why Republican leaders have been touting the candidacies of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, whose Cuban backgrounds, they hope, endear them to Latinos looking for candidates like them in the race.\n\nIt's also why Hillary Clinton hired a DREAMer to lead her outreach effort to Latinos and put out a much-maligned ad calling herself an \"abuela,\" the Spanish word for grandmother.\n\nThere's good reason for this investment. In 2012, 11.2 million Latinos turned out to vote. That was a record number, and it made up 10 percent of the entire electorate. That record is due to be shattered again later this year, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center , which projects Latinos will grow to about 11.9 percent of voters in the 2016 elections.\n\nTheir share of the electorate is certainly notable - it will mean that after this election, Latinos will pull nearly even with black voters, who are projected to make up about 12.4 percent of the 2016 electorate.\n\nThese voters hold obvious importance for the Democratic Party. In past elections, Latinos have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats, with 71 percent voting for President Barack Obama's reelection in 2012. Stripping Latino support away from the Democratic Party is an obvious priority for Republicans, as it threatens the Democrats' thin electoral advantage.\n\nThe Latino vote, though influential, is much less prominent than it could be.\n\nLatinos turn out in far lower numbers than people in most other racial groups. In 2012, about 48 percent of Hispanic eligible voters cast ballots - compared with about 64 percent of white voters and 66 percent of black voters.\n\nThough the number of eligible Latino voters had reached an all-time high, the participation rate was actually down from 2008, when just under 50 percent went to the polls. In 2014 - a midterm year, which naturally attracts fewer voters - Latino turnout dropped to 27 percent.\n\nThis means that while the share of Latinos who vote in elections is expanding, the share who don't vote is growing even faster.\n\nUndergirding these numbers is a growing concern that Latinos might be stuck in a cycle of disengagement. Pew's latest study offers several potential reasons why.\n\nBetween the 2012 and 2016 elections, about 3.2 million Latino voters will become newly eligible to cast ballots - skewing the Hispanic voting population very young. About 44 percent of the total Hispanic electorate is under the age of 35.\n\nBy contrast, voters under the age of 35 represent 27 percent of white voters and 35 percent of black voters, respectively.\n\nThat presents a double whammy for the Latino voting bloc: A disproportionate share of its electorate is young, and young people are known to punch below their weight. In 2012, only about 45 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds cast ballots, and the turnout among Latino young voters fell below the average.\n\nYoung Latinos also register to vote at a lower frequency than white or black voters, ensuring that fewer will head to the polls.\n\nSimply put, few of the typical battleground states have large Latino populations. More than half of all Latinos living in the US, about 52 percent, reside in California, New York, or Texas - none of which is a state presidential candidates focus on.\n\nAs a result, fewer Latinos will be exposed to the workings of a campaign - they are much more likely to see fewer political ads and come into contact with staffers seeking their votes. Get-out-the-vote efforts, understandably, are much weaker in noncompetitive states.\n\nThe only competitive states where Latinos make up a significant portion of the population are Colorado, Florida, and Nevada. In all three states, Latinos make up more than 14 percent of the electorate.\n\nWhen we think of Latino immigration to the US, we often think about the 11 million people who have come to the US without authorization.\n\nBut what many people don't realize is that even among Latinos who are living in the US legally, many never go through the process of becoming naturalized US citizens. That means that right now, 5.4 million Latinos are living and working in the US, but they are not becoming eligible to vote.\n\nThat's a loss for the Latino voting bloc, as naturalized citizens are significantly more likely to participate in elections than Latinos born in the US, according to Pew.\n\nExperts believe this large chunk of people aren't going through the naturalization process because, relative to the huge benefits afforded to them by a green card, the gains of naturalization are relatively small.\n\nPermanent residents can work in the US and benefit from its laws and programs. By gaining citizenship, they gain the right to vote and protection against deportation if they commit a crime - which most permanent residents won't.\n\nMoreover, the cost of naturalization is high: Simply filing a naturalization form costs $680, to say nothing of the lawyer fees many applicants pay to usher them through the process. That price tag simply doesn't seem worth it for the benefits citizenship carries.\n\nDemocrats have long linked the future success of their party to a swelling Latino population. But even if Latinos continue to vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, their growing ranks won't matter if so many Latinos continue to stay home on Election Day.\n\nRepublicans, more than Democrats, appear to have absorbed this lesson. Across the country, Republican leaders (some more intentionally than others) have been employing tactics to limit the sway of the Latino vote, from gerrymandering large Latino communities inside isolated districts to passing strict voter identification laws.\n\nThese tactics, according to an account by Jim Rutenberg in the New York Times Magazine, have done more than just limit the influence of the Latino vote. They've instilled a sense of fear among individual Latinos.\n\n''I have a lot of Spanish friends, and their parents were like, 'What is the form going to ask me?' '' Del Toro's daughter Wendy, 25, a juvenile-probation officer, told me over the phone in November. ''The word they used was 'intimidated.' '' A common question, she said, was whether they were going to be asked about their citizenship status; even though they were citizens, they were apprehensive about being seen as ''illegals.'' Their children were almost as uneasy. ''They didn't know what you need - they were like, 'I can't vote because I don't have a driver's license,' small things like that.''\n\nBut as long as Republicans continue to suppress Latino votes rather than trying to win them, there will continue to exist an inclination for Latinos to sympathize more with Democratic politicians.\n\nIf Democrats want to continue to rely on Latino voters, or if Republicans want to win them as a voting bloc outright, they must begin to pay attention to the patterns laid out in Pew's report, and counteract the forces that are deterring so many Latinos from coming out to the polls.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSo what now? 5 experts in Latino politics weigh in.\n\nby Christian Paz and Natalie Jennings\n\nIllustrations by Katty Huertas for Vox\n\nPart of The power and potential of Latino voters , from The Highlight , Vox's home for ambitious stories that explain our world.\n\nAs we've covered throughout this edition of The Highlight , Democrats and Republicans recognize the urgency of appealing to the burgeoning Latino electorate. And both are still grappling with their recent successes and shortcomings with Latinos - even as they scramble to harness their potential in the upcoming midterms.\n\nSome common theories emerged across all of our reporting for this project: Republicans feel they have a solid strategy to keep eating into Democrats' margins of victory with Latino voters, as they did in the 2020 election. And Democrats have a few ideas on how to course-correct - primarily by working harder to earn the support of a bloc many in the party acknowledge they've taken for granted.\n\nWe asked politicians, strategists, and political scientists from across the political spectrum for their analysis of what their parties have done right and wrong with those voters, and what they should do next. Below are their theories, as described in interviews and emails with Vox staff.\n\nGiancarlo Sopo, Republican | @GiancarloSopo Communications strategist and founder of Visto Media\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Hispanic outreach in recent years has been strong - it made great investments in community centers across the country and they made very smart personnel decisions.\n\nWhile Democrats draw Latino talent from liberal organizations, Republicans attract Hispanic staffers and advisers with diverse backgrounds from communities across the country. This dichotomy helps explain why Republicans are demonstrating far greater cultural fluency and sophistication in their Hispanic outreach than the Democrats.\n\nIt also helps explain why Republicans have a better grasp of where most Hispanics are at this moment. Positioning the GOP as the party of economic prosperity - while, concurrently, the Democrats were shifting away from Clintonian \"pro-growth\" messaging to a Piketty-inspired focus on income inequality and racial equity - is smart when you consider that from 2010 to 2019, the Hispanic poverty rate dropped by about 40 percent and Hispanics led the country in the creation of new small businesses .\n\nIn politics, you have to meet people where they're at, not where you want them to be or where you think they are. Hispanics are upwardly mobile, hard-working, and ambitious. We don't view ourselves as \"victims\" in this country - on the contrary. Polling shows that Hispanics believe in the American dream and that this is the best country in the world.\n\nTo be clear, there is still room for improvement in our Hispanic outreach. The biggest mistake Republicans make with Hispanics is not engaging us. For instance, the GOP was unlikely to ever win the 2021 California recall, but the effort could have made inroads with Hispanic voters with an eye toward the future with modest investments. That was a missed opportunity.\n\nRuben Gallego, Democrat | @RubenGallego U.S. Representative, Arizona's Seventh District\n\nDemocrats get into these loser mentalities. It freaking drives me nuts - just kind of circling the drain like, \"Oh, man, we suck. We suck.\" No, we won, accept the fact that we won [in 2020]. Governing is hard. We'll have to govern. Maybe [moderate Democratic Sens.] Sinema and Manchin are screwing us now. But one or two more senators and we're in a different territory.\n\nEven with this thinking that we've lost the Latino vote. Everyone calm the fuck down. We didn't lose the Latino vote. We didn't win by as much. That's the difference. We're not losing the Latino vote. We're not winning it by as much as we want to.\n\nNow, could we do better? Absolutely. So let's work on it, right? But let's not doom ourselves into this, \"Oh, man, we're not going to win, and therefore we're just not gonna invest anymore.\" And then we're just gonna really fail. Because guess what? If you're not gonna invest in Latinos to get you over the hump and African Americans and Asian Americans, are you going to really go back to white voters that have not voted Democrat? I still think it's important to talk to them, but you can't give up on Latino voters. Because if you do, your task only gets harder and harder.\n\nCristina Tzintzún Ramirez, Democrat | @CristinaNextGen President, NextGen America\n\nPeople always ask me: \"Are Latinos Republicans or Democrats?\" and I say, \"We're neither. We're poor.\" And I say that whoever invests in our community and speaks to our pain and power will win our vote.\n\nWe are the ethnic group that is the least likely to go to college. Pre-Covid, 60 percent of us were making under $15 an hour. We are the ethnic group in many states with the highest number of people that are uninsured. The policies and positions that Democrats have taken address the greatest amount of pain for the greatest number of Latino families, which is why they overwhelmingly vote for Democrats.\n\nThe shift [toward Republicans] that you have seen is because Democrats take the Latino vote for granted. They need to invest their resources in reaching the Latino population about where they stand on the policies that most Latinos care about.\n\nThe other thing Democrats need to do is invest in young Latinos in particular. The most common age for a white American is 55, for an African American, it's 27. And for Latinos, it's 11. So much of our voting power is being realized in young, new voters. That's a whole population that Democrats can win, but they've got to spend the time and money reaching that electorate, and can't just assume it's going to come to their side.\n\nThe No. 1 reason Latinos say they don't vote is that no candidate ever contacted them and they didn't know who to vote for. The data is very clear that there is underinvestment. So there's a cyclical problem with the Latino population: Campaigns and candidates don't invest in them because they don't vote, and round and round we go.\n\nI'll give you an example: In South Texas, which is considered to be a very traditional Latino population, Bernie Sanders won the 2020 Democratic primary because he spent millions of dollars and time and energy with volunteers, going out and reaching the Latino population. ... Then in the general, Trump did make major gains because the Republican Party spent time and money reaching out to Latino voters.\n\nI don't see it as a bad thing that a portion of the population in our community is up for grabs. I think it's up to elected officials and the parties to make sure that they're spending the time and money on our community that we deserve.\n\nRuy Teixeira, Democrat Nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \" Where Have All the Democrats Gone? The Soul of the Party in the Age of Extremes \"\n\nDemocrats would be well-served with this population by moving to the center on a variety of socio-cultural issues, from crime and immigration to ideological approaches to race and gender, assuring voters that, in fact, everyone's free to believe what they want to believe. ... We're a patriotic party. We believe America is fundamentally good, not a racist country, and just generally do a lot of signaling that, \"hey, we get it, we understand you're normie voters, we understand what you want. We understand what you're comfortable with.\" And we as Democrats are willing to draw some lines in terms of the necessity for public safety, in terms of security for the border, in terms of the necessity to keep ideology out of the schools. We are a tolerant party, but we are not intending to push ideology to the extent that it affects your kids or your community or your safety.\n\nI think that would be well-received among most Hispanic voters, especially Hispanic working-class voters. That's really what they want. They want upward mobility, they want safe communities, they want their kids to get a great education, they want good health care.\n\nWhich brings me to another point that the Democrats should be emphasizing: what they're doing on health care. I think an unfortunate thing about the reconciliation bill is, though it included some health care stuff, that's getting lost in all the coverage of the climate. Climate is a low-salience issue for voters as a whole, definitely for Hispanics ... even though Hispanics, like most other voting groups, are generally supportive of doing something about climate change. But in the real world, when inflation is hitting them as it is, real wages are continuing to go down and health care is even more of a problem, [Democrats should] at least emphasize the things that are a material benefit and solve real problems that Hispanic voters, particularly working-class voters, have.\n\nLorna Romero Ferguson, Republican | @LornaRomero Campaign strategist and owner of Elevate Strategies\n\nFor Republicans to continue to make gains with Latinos, I think there are three key strategies moving forward. First, we need to continue to recruit more Republican Latinos to run for office. Representation matters for any minority group. There is a different level of motivation and engagement when someone running for office is from your community, understands your culture and upbringing, and has a similar origin story as you. ...\n\nSecond, hire more Latinos as advisers to campaigns and as official staff. Latino staffers provide critical insight and experience for community engagement. A diverse staff can better inform candidates and elected officials about effective messaging strategies and help avoid any cultural missteps (i.e. first lady Jill Biden and breakfast tacos ).\n\nThird, Latino outreach should be a consistent strategy deployed in non-election years. In order to build strong and meaningful relationships, Latino outreach cannot be an afterthought during a campaign, or something done just to \"check the box.\" To gain real traction, outreach efforts and relationship building must be done year-round.\n\nI believe Republicans will make gains this year in certain states but nothing seismic nationally. It will take time to continue to build support, but Republicans are making a real effort by opening Latino outreach field offices and building a grassroots network to inform voters about the Republican Party platform. It may not yield huge results this election cycle, but the party is investing in the infrastructure, and it will be a game changer for future elections.\n\nLi Zhou contributed reporting to this story.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Democrats' latest problem: 1 in 5 Latino voters are considering switching parties\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are considering making a change, but it's Biden's party that has more to lose.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nSince 2020, one of the major questions hanging over the 2024 election is whether Latino voters will continue to ditch Democrats in favor of the GOP. Now, a new national poll of Latino voters offers some warning signs for Republicans as well as Democrats as the general election crystallizes: A sizable chunk of Latino voters appear to be willing to rethink their party loyalties.\n\nSome 19.4 percent, or about one in five Latino voters, say they have considered changing their political affiliation either by switching parties or becoming independents, according to a national survey released by Florida International University (FIU) and the marketing firm Adsmovil. A majority of those wavering voters (61.1 percent) say they'd be open to leaving the Democratic Party and a plurality of those Democratic waverers (38.1 percent) would become Republicans.\n\nThough that's a small share of all Latino voters, that's still a significant number for a demographic group whose loyalty to Democrats has been eroding since Donald Trump 's presidency.\n\n\"We used to say in political science that party [identification] was one of the most stable things that we could use to study,\" Eduardo Gamarra, the co-director of FIU's Latino Public Opinion Forum and the author of this study, told me. \"It was generational. You could go back three or four generations of voters and [party ID] would remain stable. Now, all of that is changing, and especially so among Hispanics.\"\n\nTo be sure, a majority of Latino respondents say they are still pretty firm in their political identity and affiliation. Democrats - including President Joe Biden - still win the support of an outright majority of Latino voters.\n\nSome caveats are also in order when looking at polls: This result is just one data point - a snapshot in time at the end of 2023. And the election is still eight months away, so dynamics could definitely change.\n\nBut it's a large, high-quality piece of data - a nationally representative sample of 1,221 Latino voters instead of an extrapolation from a tiny crosstab sample of a few hundred. Since 2020, other surveys and election results have also shown that Democrats are struggling to retain the support of Latino voters and reverse Republican gains. This FIU report suggests that trend is continuing.\n\nIt also suggests that 2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for American voters, particularly those younger and more diverse constituencies that make up a core part of the Democratic coalition, including Latino and Hispanic voters. These voters are feeling pressure from many directions, and Republicans have an opportunity to expand the inroads they have made and held since the 2020 election .\n\nThe Democratic coalition is changing. The open question is just how drastic that change will be.\n\nGamarra is right when he says that partisanship has tended to be a pretty static factor in American politics; the same is roughly true for Latino voters. Looking at survey data from 1994 to 2017, the Pew Research Center reports that partisan affiliation among all registered voters has generally not changed in those two decades. The same has been true for Hispanic and Latino voters in the years for which Pew has data available: The share of Latino voters identifying as Democrats or leaning to that party has stayed roughly the same from 2004 to 2017 with about a 60-30 split in affiliation.\n\nBut more recently, those allegiances have shifted a bit - and to Democrats' detriment. Trump made electoral gains with Latinos in 2020 that Republican candidates were generally able to keep during the 2022 midterms . And the Democratic advantage in Latino partisan affiliation began to shrink during and after Trump's presidency. In 2017, for example, Democrats enjoyed a 35-point advantage over Republicans with whom Latino voters identified; two years later, that advantage was 28 points, according to Pew's numbers . That smaller gap stuck around in 2022.\n\nThose are small shifts, but they point to there being fertile ground for additional changes in partisan loyalty during the 2024 cycle.\n\nAnd this is where the FIU/Adsmovil study adds new insights: Those 19 percent of Hispanic and Latino voters who say they'd be open to switching parties are mostly voters who'd be open to leaving the Democratic coalition - about 60 percent of those voters.\n\nMore specifically, 38.1 percent of these wavering voters would flip affiliation from Democratic to Republican. An additional 23 percent would switch from Democratic to independent.\n\nThe survey also showed Latino Republicans rethinking their chosen party. But those Democratic losses are greater than whatever gains they would make from Republicans changing their loyalty. Of these waverers, 11.1 percent would flip from Republican to Democrat and 6.2 percent would leave the Republicans to become independent.\n\nThere's a silver lining for Democrats among self-described independent Latino voters who are considering a change. There, 9 percent would become Democrats, as opposed to the 5.3 percent who would become Republicans.\n\nThese numbers confirm a finding from Pew after the 2022 midterms that, though partisan affiliation has been relatively stable for most of the last 20 years, the future of these patterns \"remains uncertain.\" A good deal of Latino voters are the kind of partisans \"with soft ties to the political parties.\" According to Pew, there are about one in 10 Latino voters who call themselves Democrat or Republican but hold political and ideological views that are much closer to the opposite political party.\n\nThese are the kind of cross-pressured, persuadable voters that could be won over through smart campaigning, tailored messaging, and exploiting the preexisting sense of dissatisfaction many voters have with both parties.\n\nThese figures all suggest that Republicans have a big opportunity in 2024 to reorder demographic and political coalitions. But it won't be easy.\n\nWhen asked which political party would better handle specific issues, Democrats still receive the support of a majority of Latino voters on traditionally Democratic topics, like education or health care , in this FIU/Adsmovil study. But they only get a plurality of support on the economy , immigration, and foreign policy - areas that make sense for Republicans to center as campaign issues this cycle.\n\nAt the presidential level, the FIU poll also shows that Trump and Republicans can hold onto their 2020 gains. A third of Latino voters say they'd back Trump now, while a slight majority of 53 percent would back Biden. A separate 13 percent aren't sure about their pick, and it's this wavering group of voters that Republicans have a chance to attract and that may have a wavering loyalty to Biden specifically.\n\nStill, about 60 percent of Latino voters in this poll think the Democrats are the political party that best represents them, compared to the 24 percent who say that about Republicans. That 60 percent is higher than both the share of voters who would call themselves Democrats (56 percent), and who would back Biden now (53 percent), which suggests room for Democratic growth and a challenge for Republicans who will have to do a lot of persuasion in the next few months.\n\nAnd there will be more to complicate the path for Republicans: Latino voters have a lower propensity to vote, to be tuned into the political cycle at this point, and to hear from political candidates, meaning they'll have to invest heavily in outreach and specific messaging to these communities. Democrats have a slight leg up on this, given how much they have relied on Latino voters before.\n\nBut all the signs are pointing toward an electorate in churn. It may still shift a lot in the coming months, and it may surprise a lot of people come November.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAfter years of Democratic missteps with Latino voters, Biden's 2024 campaign has a plan - and no excuses left.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that President Joe Biden and his campaign will face as they embark on his fourth presidential campaign has been obvious for years: rebuilding support from Latino voters. Republican gains in Latino communities have been a major political story, a growing insecurity for Democratic politicians and donors, and a big liability for the Biden administration.\n\nIn 2020, Donald Trump did 8 percentage points better with Latino voters than he did in 2016, winning nearly 40 percent of Latino voters nationally. Trump made inroads in heavily Latino regions of southern Florida and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas - all while Republicans flipped House seats in districts with large Latino populations from California to Florida. Republicans retained most of this Latino support in the 2022 midterms, holding about 40 percent of their national popular vote . And polling shows most of this support holding steady.\n\nThose GOP gains stunned much of the political world. But, for many Democrats, the mistakes were clear. In 2020, the Biden campaign started their major Latino outreach operations far too late, and were limited early on by the pandemic and a lack of funds, which hurt their ability to invest in all the places they needed. As a result, Democrats let Trump gain the upper hand with his economic messaging.\n\nBut speaking to Latino civil rights leaders and activists now, I got a sense of anxious optimism about how Biden's campaign, and Democratic candidates in general, will approach their Latino voter operations this year. The recent hire of Julie Chávez Rodríguez as Biden's 2024 campaign manager is one sign that the Biden campaign is learning from 2020. Chávez Rodríguez is a White House aide, former Kamala Harris and Biden 2020 campaign staffer, and granddaughter of the labor icon Cesar Chavez, and she is largely credited for reviving the 2020 campaign's Latino voter efforts.\n\n\"In 2020 and 2022, Latinos were critical to Democratic wins, and that requires real, sustained investment in the community,\" Kevin Munoz, spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign, told Vox. Munoz also touted the wins the Biden administration has delivered, including near-historic low levels of unemployment for Latinos. \"We won't take any support for granted. The campaign will build on the progress that's been made to earn Latinos' votes and expand our winning coalition,\" he said.\n\nBut after two election cycles' worth of missteps and challenges, Biden and Democrats have time to correct past mistakes and 2020 should give them all the lessons they need.\n\nThough the GOP gains with Latino voters shocked experts in 2020 and did not dissipate during midterm elections last year, Democrats have still held on to solid Latino majorities, including in key swing states . That voter breakdown depends on what states you examine, but the challenge Biden will face this time remains the same: start your outreach early, fine tune an economic message, and remind voters of your accomplishments.\n\nHis campaign struggled with these tasks in 2020. During the 2020 primary, for example, Biden's Latino outreach operation was overshadowed by Bernie Sanders's in states like California, Nevada, and Texas, largely due to scarcity of staffing and funding during that ultra-competitive contest. Meanwhile in the general election, staffing struggles, the coronavirus pandemic, and leadership changes meant the campaign couldn't get out in front of voters themselves until later in the race, contributing to losses in Florida and Texas (which, at the time, were considered to be in play).\n\n\"The lessons have been out there for way longer than the last two cycles - candidates matter, positions matter, and critical outreach is essential,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, the vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at the civil rights group Unidos US, told me. \"Generally speaking, we continue to see low and late outreach to Hispanic voters, when and if it happens.\"\n\nBiden and Democrats faced tremendous criticism throughout the 2020 Democratic primary and into the general election for the state of their Latino voter outreach operations. Martinez de Castro was one of those voices, calling it \"political malpractice\" for candidates to wait until the last minute to engage them during the primary season. She, like other experts I spoke with, told me that politicians of both parties have no excuses now after the 2020 and 2022 wake-up calls to get serious about persuading these new swing voters.\n\nMartinez de Castro said that Democrats had fallen particularly short in messaging to Latinos about kitchen-table issues. \"[Democrats] need to actually reach out to and win over these voters and engage more on economic issues, which continue to be the top of mind issues for the Latino community as they have been for at least a couple of decades,\" she said.\n\nThe predominance of economic concerns in the minds of Latino voters isn't new - inflation and the state of the economy were frequently the top issues for Latinos in polling throughout the 2020 and 2022 elections. But in both cycles, Democrats had fallback issues that gave them an edge over Republicans: the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the future of abortion rights. On both issues, Latino voters preferred Democrats by about 11 points on abortion and 10 points on the pandemic , according to exit polls. But with inflation still high, rising interest rates, and the looming specter of a recession, it's clear that Biden will have to talk about the economy in a more nuanced way, Latino strategists told me.\n\nThat nuance means Democrats need to remind Latinos just how bad the situation Biden inherited was, address fears of inflation and a recession directly, and cast Latino voters as \"protagonists\" who Biden helped, Kristian Ramos, a Latino political consultant for various Democratic groups and former communications director for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told me. The economic message Latino voters are hearing should include that \"We know the play,\" Ramos said, \"At this point, are we going to be able to take that head on and be able to say, 'Listen, Democrats, actually, when you were down, we gave you the child tax credit to make sure that your kid was able to thrive, that you could buy groceries, to send your kids to school, and we tried to give you student loan relief but the Republicans tried to get rid of that,'\" Ramos said.\n\nPart of that tightrope act will also require Biden to build a better ground operation to understand the diversity of the country's Latino communities and craft messages suited for those places. For example, the Democratic National Committee has a new starting point for this: During the midterms, they developed a program to train local Latino organizers to serve as surrogates for Democratic candidates.\n\nMessaging also matters. The appeal to freedom, patriotism, and national unity that Biden previewed in his campaign launch video, for example, is well suited for some of the more conservative Mexican American and Cuban American communities along the Southern border and in Florida that have moved toward Republicans.\n\nTo frame the election around freedom, especially when talking to Latino voters, \"is brilliant,\" Cristóbal Alex, a former senior advisor to Biden's campaign, told me, since it also inoculates voters against some of the references to \"socialism\" that Trump made central to his 2020 campaign. Reclaiming that patriotic tone, and engaging on cultural issues, can also appeal directly to those Latino voters that have drifted toward Republicans.\n\n\"Oftentimes in America, people misjudge the level of patriotism in the Latino community,\" Javier Palomarez, the president of the U.S. Hispanic Business Council, told me, adding that Latinos make up a big percentage of frontline workers, military personnel, police officers, and border patrol officers. \"In 2020, there was a real sense of resentment and a real sense of abandonment, and so these are the things that became ripe for the Republican Party to fill the void.\"\n\nThis time around, the expectation is that void won't exist. Chávez Rodríguez as campaign manager and Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) as a key surrogate inspired confidence in everyone who spoke with me for this story about just how serious the Biden campaign would get about Latinos, but they all reiterated that staffing is only the beginning.\n\n\"Latinas, in particular, are the most underrepresented in every space of power in the nation and in our history. So having Julie [Chávez Rodríguez] in this particular position is historical, and is great news not only for the campaign for us, but for our democracy,\" Héctor Sánchez Barba, the CEO and executive director of the voter mobilization group Mi Familia Vota, told me.\n\nThe White House, also, has been ramping up the president's and vice president's engagement with Latino groups and media in interviews, visits, and speeches in the lead-up to the 2024 campaign launch.\n\nChávez Rodríguez, experts told me, will have a big say in how and where the campaign spends its money - one of the big criticisms of Biden in his last campaign. Back in 2019, when the Democratic primary was heating up, the Biden campaign was strapped for cash, limiting the resources it could invest in Latino voter outreach, hiring, and deployment of staff. Meanwhile, Biden's chief rival in the primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, was investing significant resources into Latino communities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada , Iowa, and Texas. At the time, Sanders was receiving the strongest fundraising support from Latinos of all the 2020 Democratic contenders, according to an NBC News analysis - more than $8 million of the $23 million they gave in 2019. Once the general election took off, the Sanders campaign offered Biden's lessons , staffing, and independent advertising support, and Biden aides and advisers told me and other reporters that the campaign would redouble its efforts at reaching Latino voters with the new financial resources it had. Much of that spending came late , starting in July and ramping up after the party conventions in August, and the pandemic limited direct engagement with voters - contributing to the gains Republicans made that year.\n\nThe Biden campaign is now starting fresh. The pandemic will not limit door-knocking and field operations. He is the presumptive nominee, with the backing of the party and donors, so money shouldn't be an issue, though the campaign will have to make a decision about just how seriously to invest in some states, like North Carolina, which has a large but neglected Latino voter population that could put the state in play, and Florida, which has drifted so much into Republican hands that a serious persuasion operation might drain the campaign of resources. Biden won't be competing with other candidates for staffing. And his team won't lack experience. He has the opportunity to go to conventions of Latino leaders that he skipped in 2019, like those hosted this summer by the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and avoid accusations of neglecting Latinos.\n\nLuis A. Miranda Jr., the chair of the Democratic-aligned Latino Victory Fund, said the political action group will also be working to ensure the campaign sticks by its commitments. \"We will work with the Biden campaign to engage and mobilize Latino voters, and take nothing for granted come November 2024,\" he said in a statement to Vox.\n\nFinally, he'll also have the opportunity to avoid embarrassing gaffes - like the 2020 meme that became emblematic of his struggles with Latinos, when he played the song \"Despacito\" at a rally in Florida, and inspired a wave of memes. The stakes are high.

      "text": "Latinx, Latino and Hispanic: How this ethnic group's label has sparked debate\n\nOne poll shows only 4% of U.S. Latinos use the non-binary term, Latinx.\n\nThe many pan-ethnic labels used to describe the group of people who trace their roots to Latin America or Spain -- terms like Hispanic, Latino , Latinx or Latine -- have left some confused, some angry and many people debating what word to use.\n\nHispanic and Latino remain the dominant terms to refer to people from this group, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nHowever, other terms have been growing in popularity, including Latinx and Latine, gender-neutral versions of the masculine and feminine words for Latino and Latina.\n\nProponents of the use of terms Latinx and Latine say they are inclusive, non-gendered terms for nonbinary, gender-fluid, queer people of Latin American heritage. However, some have begun to use the term to refer to the ethnic community as a whole, instead of using the typical, masculine \"Latino.\"\n\nAccording to experts in Latin American studies and culture, some of the earliest known uses of these terms began in Latin American feminist and queer activist circles. Activists say the terms disrupt the gender binary and norms that they say are ever-present in the language and culture.\n\n\"It's their own political gesture of showing how human language is insufficient to capture the nuances of their gender,\" added Xiomara Verenice Cervantes-Gómez, a professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in an interview with ABC News.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, \"Latinx\" could be seen in art and graffiti from these groups throughout the United States, Latin America and Spain, according to cultural scholars. In some ways, the anger and debate over the term is to be expected, according to Nicole M. Guidotti-Hernández, a professor at Emory University.\n\nThe terms force people to confront the spectrum of gender and sexuality, Guidotti-Hernández told ABC News.\n\nOnly 23% of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino had heard of the term Latinx, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center poll. Just 3% use it to identify themselves, the poll found.\n\nThe word is mostly known and used by younger Hispanics -- 42% of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 29 knew the term, but only 7% of those ages 65 or older have heard of the term, Pew reports.\n\nHowever, a majority of those surveyed in a Gallup poll -- 57% -- said it didn't matter how they labeled.\n\nThose critical of \"Latinx\" say it \"anglicized\" the Spanish language, ignored the language's roots, and \"is not representative of the larger Latino community,\" according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\nSome who favor gender neutral terms say \"Latine\" serves as an alternative to \"Latinx\" to quell grammatical or linguistic concerns.\n\nLanguage researcher, author and TikTok sensation Dr. Jose Medina argues that Spanish is already the language of colonization in Latin America.\n\n\"The truth is that, if we really stop to think about it, we were colonized from the moment that the Spaniards came to the Americas and took away Indigenous tongues,\" said Medina.\n\n\"All of these attacks on really utilizing and leveraging linguistic liberation as a way to value intersectionality -- [it's] something that each and every one of us should defend, not oppose.\"\n\nIn December 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic and Latino civil rights organization in the U.S., and Congressman Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., stated they would no longer use the term \"Latinx\" because it was offensive to some and failed to prove it had a wide acceptance.\n\n\"When Latino politicos use the term it is largely to appease white rich progressives who think that is the term we use,\" Gallego tweeted .\n\nArkansas Gov. and former Trump White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order to ban the use of \"Latinx\" in official government documents, calling the word \"culturally insensitive.\"\n\n\"Ethnically insensitive and pejorative language has no place in official government documents or government employee titles,\" the executive order read.\n\nAt the center of this debate, Guidotti-Hernández says, is the fight for self-determination and identification.\n\nIn the past, some have criticized the use of the term \"Hispanic\" as well. Guidotti-Hernández said the term links this diverse, large group to colonization.\n\n\"It's created by the Nixon administration in the 1960s to try and understand and track the Spanish speaking and/or descendants of Spanish colonialism in the United States,\" said Guidotti-Hernández. \"A lot of people resent that term, because it's the government terminus, not self-generated.\"\n\nIt can be difficult to label a complex ethnic group in a single term, Medina added. These words link people from more than 20 countries in South and Central America, the Caribbean and Spain -- of all different races, languages and cultures.\n\n\"Even for the term Latin, Latino, Latinx, it sounds very singular and homogenizing ... This at least forces us to think about the ways that our communities are much more heterogeneous, much more diverse,\" said Cervantes-Gómez.\n\nMedina says the term \"Latinx\" is just a tool to be used to be more inclusive.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we need to be able to self-identify as we wish because nobody has the right to do that for someone else,\" said Medina. \"And if that means that each of us identifies in a different way, then so be it. That is what we should be able to do.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Political trauma is fueling the Latino far right, author says\n\nPaola Ramos says Dems can't rely on Latino voters to take them into the future.\n\nJournalist Paola Ramos sat down with ABC News to discuss the cultural vulnerabilities facing Latinos during this election cycle as documented in her new book, \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America.\"\n\nRamos' book looks at how political trauma has influenced the rise of the far-right in the Latino community, and how this group, in particular, is poised to shape American politics.\n\nRamos discussed the themes in her book with ABC News' Linsey Davis.\n\nABC NEWS: In 2020, a Pew Research Center report found the Latino vote for former President Trump ranked at a narrower margin than the Latino vote he secured in 2016. The small yet growing group of Latinos in the United States are redefining the electorate through their voting trends at staggering rates.\n\nPart sociological analysis, part historical excavation of the vast Latino experience, author, Emmy Award-winning journalist and filmmaker Paolo Ramos' newest work, \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America,\" looks at just that. And Paola, kind enough to join us in studio. Thank you.\n\nPAOLA RAMOS: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nABC NEWS: So, you really went to extreme, really, I think, to find these Latino voices who, based on their own experiences, have really -- it's shaped their, in particular, right-leaning political outlooks. Why did you decide you wanted to tell their story in particular?\n\nRAMOS: Well, I think because if even, if you look at the election now, I know we're five weeks away from November and someone like Donald Trump, regardless of how you identify, but someone like Donald Trump that is promising mass deportations, that has sort of criminalized immigrants the way that he has and is polling at around 40% with Latino voters.\n\nAnd so I think it's important to understand \"the why.\" And I think Democrats for so long have really sort of based their theory of change around this idea that it would be Latino voters that would sort of take them on to the future, that they would be the heart of this multiracial, multiethnic coalition.\n\nAnd here we are, sort of facing a different reality. And I think you can explain the sort of right-wing shifts through the Trump effect. But I think the more interesting part is understanding like the way that our history, you know, the weight of colonialism, the sort of political trauma that a lot of Latinos carry, like how all of that manifests in American politics is very messy.\n\nABC NEWS: And you talk about the exploitation of political trauma. What do you mean by that, exactly?\n\nRAMOS: So, even if we think about South Florida now, there's a reason why Donald Trump sort of always casts the Democratic Party as [the party of the Communists, of communism]. There's a reason why he says things like Comrade Kamala all the time. And that's because he knows that there is a section of Latinos that have very real political traumas of fleeing Venezuela or Cuba or places in Central America.\n\nAnd what Republicans have done I think really well is sort of manipulate that meaning of words, where we're suddenly staring at a Democratic candidate that is seen as a socialist, where Obamacare is seen as [communism]. And so that manipulation, that exploitation of the political trauma, I think drives a lot of Latinos to truly believe that they're staring at a Democratic Party that is threatening in the sense that they believe that they could turn into a communist party.\n\nABC NEWS: There's also a really interesting concept where you have people who are the descendants of immigrants who now are anti-immigration and really support the kind of rhetoric that says, you know, 'yeah, let's just build the wall.' And so is that surprising? And, and how does that come about? How do people explain to you: 'Yes, I was able to get in, but I don't want other people to come.'\n\nRAMOS: I think, very simply, because they don't see themselves sort of reflected in the immigrant story anymore. And I think when Trump says things like send them back, not build the wall for them and they don't see themselves reflected in the event.\n\nAnd if you look at the numbers, it sort of makes sense now, the way that Latinos have evolved, and really many Latinos have become so Americanized and assimilated, and know that even when you ask them, how do you identify? I still identify as a Latina, but there's many others that see themselves as sort of part of mainstream America. And I always say this, but just because we're Latinos and immigrants does not make us immune to sort of the anti-immigrant rhetoric nor the xenophobia.\n\nXenophobia is a very contagious, toxic thing, particularly when it's driven by fear and the otherizing words. I have also found that there's some Latinos that because they themselves have been exposed to the discrimination, particularly when I think mainstream media covers the border and sort of covers the caravans, the studies do show that the anti-Latino hate crimes actually spike when we're all talking about the border.\n\nAnd, so I think when you combine the anti-immigrant sentiment and the xenophobia in some Latinos' sort of deep quest to prove that they belong in this country, it can turn into new forms of extremism.\n\nABC NEWS: What do you see the direction going, the future of the Latino vote, and why is it so urgent to understand it now?\n\nRAMOS: I think in, in this election, it will be crucial to understand whether those inroads that Trump made in 2020 were anomalies or are Latinos truly sort of rethinking where they belong politically?\n\nABC NEWS: Paola Ramos, thank you so much. What a pleasure to have the conversation with you. I want to let our viewers know you can purchase \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America\" wherever books are sold.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Latino voters in battlegrounds share diverse priorities they want Harris, Trump to address\n\nLatinos are the second-largest group of eligible voters in the U.S.\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris visited the border town of Douglas, Arizona, in late September, it marked the first time Alexandra Cáñez and her friends, Miguel Angel Felix Pacheco and Hector Felix, had ever seen a presidential candidate visit what they call their \"sleepy\" town.\n\nThe friends -- all in their 20s -- have differing views of the nearby border. Felix calls it part of his \"everyday life;\" Cáñez said \"everyone kind of disregards our community even though everyone is always talking about the border\" and welcomed Harris' attention.\n\nHarris visited the critical battleground state of Arizona to announce stricter border policies -- a key voter issue as Election Day approaches. Harris and former President Donald Trump are working to both touch on key voter issues, such as border security, immigration and the economy while trying to appeal to diverse Latino voters -- one of the fastest-growing and largest groups -- in battleground states.\n\nLatinos have grown at the second-fastest rate of any major racial and ethnic group in the U.S. electorate since the last presidential election, according to Pew Research . They are the second-largest group of eligible voters in the United States.\n\nThrough ads, outreach and campaign events, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have worked to engage Latino voters -- including participating in two different Univision town hall events in front of Spanish-speaking audiences with Harris' event on Thursday evening and Trump's taking place next week.\n\nStill, many Latinos say photos of politicians touching the border wall aren't going to solve their problems.\n\n\"I think where both parties really mess it up is they put us all in the same bucket,\" said Enrique Castro, a Reading, Pennsylvania, voter who is Puerto Rican. \"Yes, I acknowledge something needs to be done about the border, but them going down there to take pictures at the border, that's not gonna change anything here, especially without an actual plan of fixing it without making immigrants look like they're criminals.\"\n\nReading, Pennsylvania, often referred to as the \"Latino Belt,\" boast 67% of its population has Latin decent, according to U.S. census figures . In 2011, it was declared the poorest city in America with a poverty rate of 41% -- although it dropped to 29% in 2023, which is still more than double the national average, according to U.S. Census Bureau findings .\n\nFor Reading voters -- as well as Latino voters overall, both Latino outreach and economic messaging are important.\n\nThe top issues for Hispanic voters are the economy, inflation and health care, according to an August ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll. The priorities fall right in line with the top issues for Americans overall, polling shows.\n\nIn the battleground states, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona, where Harris and Trump are locked in a razor-thin race, the Latino vote is crucial in getting them over the finish line -- and knowing how to appeal to the Latino voters in both border states and other battlegrounds is a crucial mission as Election Day nears, experts told ABC News.\n\n\"[Latinos] come from so many different countries of origin, so you can't just show up in Miami with a sombrero and a taco truck,\" said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha.\n\nThe diversity of the community makes it difficult to target the ranging cultural and generational differences. What matters to an El Salvadoran American varies from Puerto Ricans and so, too, should the outreach toward these groups, Rocha said.\n\nIn order to reach these differing cultural identities including under the Latino umbrella, the Harris campaign said it has launched a robust effort to \"micro target\" the community - an effort that tailors outreach to best serve its intended audience.\n\n\"The Latino vote is as critical as it is diverse, and since day one, our campaign has reflected our community's diversity. With over 13 Latino Diaspora groups including, Boricuas con Kamala, Venezolanos con Kamala and Mexicanos con Kamala, an aggressive paid media campaign targeting Latinos everywhere they consume news, and new organizing efforts on WhatsApp, we're running an all-the-above Latino outreach strategy designed to earn every single vote,\" Harris-Walz Coalitions Media Director Maca Casado said in a statement.\n\nThe Harris campaign, for their part, has made efforts to decenter their message from identity politics. They're running ads in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania in both English and Spanish that focus on the economy, high drug prices and crime.\n\nRocha said the Harris campaign is effective in targeting different Latino voters.\n\n\"You see them doing ads in Pennsylvania in Puerto Rican Spanish and ads in Arizona in Mexican Spanish,\" Rocha said. \"The campaign's doing it in the right way: micro-targeting, multiple languages, different cultural content.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Mike Madrid said he agrees that speaking to varying groups of Latinos voters based on their cultural identity has merit, but he said he thinks the campaign should be more focused on Latinos as \"working-class voters.\" That strategy could appeal to Latinos' views on the economy, an election issue where Trump leads Harris, according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll .\n\n\"They're over micro-targeting, and they're not doing enough to focus on the largest common thread, which is an economic populist, pocketbook voter,\" said Madrid, who co-founded The Lincoln Project to oppose Trump and actively helped Biden in his 2020 presidential bid. \"What they should be doing is speaking more to them as working-class voters and less as Latino voters.\"\n\nMadrid said Republicans are employing this strategy by targeting Latinos as working-class Americans rather than by their ethnic identity.\n\nIn June, the Trump campaign rebranded its Hispanic outreach from \"Latinos for Trump\" to \"Latino Americans for Trump,\" emphasizing the American identity of the Latino voter. Trump's campaign also opened an office in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump held a rally in Reading, during which he falsely described immigration as an invasion.\n\n\"We will not allow these people to invade us or to conquer us,\" Trump said.\n\nBoth campaigns are working to appeal to voters in Pennsylvania, an important battleground state, which Biden won by some 80,000 votes in 2020. Harris is only ahead by a 1% margin, according to 538's polling average .\n\nAlso, both candidates are working to attract the coveted Latino vote in the battlegrounds. Latino voters divide 57-39%, Harris-Trump, according to a September Pew Research study -- a far greater divide compared to Black voters who split 77-13%.\n\nThe number of Latinos eligible to vote has grown by 40% since 2016, according to Pew Research . Rocha said that the relative newness of the community in the United States has made them less likely to be loyal to one particular party and more likely to vote based on \"who shows up.\"\n\nBut Madrid warns that Democrats risk alienating third and fourth generation voters who no longer identify with politicians who are simply showing up. He surmised that these younger voters are creating an \"emergence of a new vote.\"\n\n\"It's an emergence because [they] are so young,\" said Madrid.\n\nThirty-one percent of Latino voters are under 30, according to Pew Research , and an estimated 36.2 million are eligible to vote this year, up from 32.3 million in 2020. This represents 50% of the total growth in eligible voters during this time, Pew Research found.\n\n\"They're coming online and emerging as something very unique,\" Madrid added.\n\nFelix, Cáñez and Pacheco of Douglas spoke to ABC News after a study session at Cochise Community College where Harris was making a planned campaign stop at the same time. As they watched attendees go inside, they said they would not be hearing Harris speak and were unsure about whether her visit to their community would translate into a vote for the vice president in November.\n\nStill, the three friends continued to wait outside the venue in hopes of catching a glimpse of Harris.\n\nPacheco said he was hoping to see something from Harris that would inspire him to participate in a way other politicians have failed to do for him so far.\n\n\"[I'm] hoping to see something we haven't seen before,\" Pacheco said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

More than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes as the Santa Ana winds further exacerbate the situation. At least 16 fire-related deaths are being investigated by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, and many people are injured.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, more than 4.8 million people are Hispanic or Latino, the latest U.S. Census data shows. With deep roots in the region, many Latinos have taken initiatives to mobilize the community and provide support.\n\n\"A friend of mine texted me telling me her house had burned down,\" Corissa Hernandez, a small business owner, told ABC News. \"I can't even imagine losing everything I've worked for in my personal space, so I immediately went to social media and just put out a call for action.\"\n\nAfter learning from local city leaders of the need for food, water and masks, Hernandez announced on social media that she was helping collect these items at Nativo HLP, the Mexican food restaurant she owns in Highland Park.\n\nThat initial endeavor expanded tremendously because of the Latino community, according to Hernandez.\n\n\"It's such an honor and a humbling experience to see us all rally together for the most vulnerable amongst us, and it's just one of those moments where you just feel so proud to be part of LA and this community,\" she said.\n\nHernandez is a board member of the Independent Hospitality Coalition, an advocacy group for bars and restaurants in Los Angeles. She said several restaurants and chefs who are part of that network responded to her call and began connecting her to shelters and evacuation centers in need of resources.\n\nHernandez ultimately partnered with Guerilla Tacos DTLA and Guelaguetza, two other Mexican restaurants, to gather donations and deliver meals to people in need, she said. Together, they have created a central hub for all their operations and donations.\n\n\"I cannot take credit for what has evolved,\" Hernandez said. \"Since then, we've distributed collectively over 1,500 warm meals to evacuation centers and fire departments, hundreds of donations have gone out, and this has been in collaboration with my network.\"\n\nLatino community members in LA have gotten creative with their efforts to help provide mutual aid. Several taquerias are offering free tacos to first responders, L.A. Taco first reported, and Latinx Therapy, a mental health resource hub for Latinos, is organizing pro-bono providers to offer free therapy to Latino families impacted by the wildfires.\n\nSupport from the Latino community is also coming from around the world. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that firefighters from Mexico were arriving to join the \"more than 10,000 personnel already on the ground.\"\n\n\"California is deeply grateful for President @ClaudiaShein's support as we work to suppress the Los Angeles wildfires,\" Newsom posted on X.\n\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, told ABC News a total of 70 firefighters from Mexico, including three information officers, arrived Saturday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, Las Fotos Project, a nonprofit organization that mentors teenage girls and gender-expansive youth through photography, has created a bulletin-style database on its website where fire victims can describe their current needs and directly connect with people who can help them.\n\n\"We always say we find power in our stories and we find power in our communities. I really hope that this database can sustain people [and] support in the long term,\" Helen Alonzo Hurtado, social enterprise director for Las Fotos Project, told ABC News. \"Two to three weeks from now, as folks are getting settled in their temporary housing and they're realizing what it is that they need, they can put that there and then community members can respond.\"\n\nAlonzo Hurtado said that despite hosting community wellness days, Las Fotos Project is not an emergency response nonprofit and is not equipped to mobilize in such a capacity. Even so, she said, the group was motivated to help victims, including some of their own members who lost their homes and were displaced in the Eaton Fire.\n\n\"We're starting to see how many Latino families and Black families in Altadena were impacted,\" she said. \"When you think about that community, it's been home to a lot of working-class folks who have been able to build generational wealth, and that was just lost overnight.\"\n\nThe Latino-led group hopes to make an impact with its database and further rally the community to help those in need.\n\n\"In our culture, we have the kermeses [parties to fundraise for low-income community members, usually for funerals], and we have these initiatives to come together to support one another.\" Alonzo Hurtado said. \"We're seeing so many people impacted and we're not just mobilizing for the Latino community, but for all the people affected.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Because of the confusion surrounding what to call people whose ethnic background is from Latin American and Spanish-speaking countries.  Some even feel 100% American or 100% Latino - or Hispanic, depending to whom you're talking.\n\nHow do you know which term to use? \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" are often used interchangeably and aim to describe the same group of people, but technically they do not mean the same thing.\n\nWhat's more, within Hispanic communities in the United States, most people identify with their country of origin and often use hyphens to represent their loyalties to both cultures: like \"Mexican-American.\"\n\nWe're constantly having to straddle two worlds: the one where our families came from and where we've chosen to live.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, all that can change depending on where Latinos are in any given moment.\n\nWhen I'm in my parents' native country of Peru, I'm American with Peruvian parents and that's that. No matter how hard I've tried to be \"Peruvian enough\" to my fellow Peruvians, I might as well be a gringa in their eyes.\n\nShare your immigration story with CNN iReport\n\nAnd, when I'm back in United States, someone will inevitably ask me where I'm from in a way that suggests I'm not from the good ol' U.S. of A.\n\nIn other words, imagine having to constantly tell people that you're made of two colors: blue and yellow, but all people see is green, and you constantly have to go in the light and show them you are made of both colors.\n\nIdentifying as Hispanic or Latino comes with its ups and downs. But perhaps breaking down what these terms mean and how they're used within this diverse community of 54 million Latinos can help shed some light on our experience.\n\nHispanic or Latino?\n\nYears ago, I attended a media networking event hoping to meet more established journalists.\n\nI remember saying something along the lines of, \"Ah, the joys of being Hispanic,\" and an older Latina woman turned around and said, \"No, sweetie, you are a Latina. Don't refer to yourself as Hispanic. The government invented that word for us.\"\n\nUm, OK. I think I hit a nerve.\n\nThen, a younger Latino man snickered and asked her to not take those labels so seriously. She quickly turned to him and, judging by her wide eyes and stiff demeanor, she clearly did not agree. Her eyes then met with mine and she looked at me as if I had to make a choice: Hispanic or Latino? What's it going to be?\n\nThe room immediately felt as if it divided into two uncomfortable teams.\n\nI could feel the warm embrace from the \"Hispanic team,\" which was easygoing and used both terms interchangeably, and imagined them saying to me, \"Come on over! Hispanic? Latino? Whatever you feel is best.\"\n\nBut the looming eyes of \"Latino team\" made me feel obligated to side with them and take some kind of political stance on the term. Using Latino had a slight \"sticking it to the man\" feel.\n\nI wasn't sure how I felt about identifying with either term, so I decided to hold my tongue, take a deep breath and smile.\n\nEven though this woman I had never met tried to impose her label on me, she was partially right.\n\nThe term Hispanic was first used by the U.S. government in the 1970s in an attempt to count people from Mexico, Cuba and Central and South America but what she failed to mention was that the term has existed for centuries.\n\nBack then, there wasn't a private or public sector that had a uniform way of collecting data on the Hispanic community, so a committee was formed and it opted not to use Latino because, if taken literally, it could include Europeans of Latin origin.\n\nThe goal was to accurately account for this growing and discriminated against population so laws could be implemented to help with their needs as well as trace their accomplishments.\n\nThe term Latino finally came to fruition in the 2000 census as a more inclusive way to include mixed races known as \"mestizo\" or \"mulato\" in Central and South America.\n\nIn short, Hispanic refers to language and Latino refers to geography.\n\nOne reason for my ambivalence with both these terms is that I didn't grow up using either one.\n\nI was born and raised in New Jersey by my Peruvian immigrant parents in a predominantly Hispanic community where everyone identified with their family's country of origin. I was Peruvian for the better half of my life and it's perhaps why I use the terms interchangeably and have no preference.\n\nI'm not alone.\n\nMost Hispanics in the United States prefer to use their country of origin to describe themselves most often. About half said they have no preference for either term but for those who did, Hispanic was preferred over \"Latino,\" according to the Pew Research Center .\n\n\"For example, in California, the state with the largest Hispanic population, 30% say they prefer 'Hispanic' and 17% say they prefer the term 'Latino,'\" according to Pew. The results were similar in Florida and New York.\n\nThe only exception is Texas where there was an overwhelming preference for \"Hispanic.\" Among Hispanic Texans, 46% prefer the term Hispanic, while 8% say they prefer Latino.\n\nBut this wasn't always the case.\n\n\"There was a time when Latino was primarily used in the West Coast and Hispanic on the East Coast,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe use of both pan-ethnic terms are unique to the United States, Lopez added, as is the ongoing identity debate on which term to use.\n\nLatino vs. Hispanic on social media\n\nLatinos are the most active of all ethnic groups on social media networking sites - Hispanic adults topping at 72%, followed by African Americans at 68% and whites at 65% - and CNN recently looked into which term was used more often and in what state across the country.\n\nEven though Pew found that  Hispanic was preferred over Latino when it came to identity, in the past year, CNN found that Latino was mentioned more on Twitter than Hispanic.\n\n\"From what I've seen, the term Hispanic inspires more rage than Latino,\" said Adrian Carrasquillo, former social media manager at NBC Latino and now editor of Latino coverage for BuzzFeed.\n\n\"For a long time the Latino community has been fragmented, but now they are starting to have more cohesion and the rise of Latino is bringing people together more,\" he added.\n\nThe term's popularity may also have to do with the sudden surge of niche sites that containin the term, like Fox New Latino or The Huffington Post's LatinoVoices or two new magazines: Cosmopolitan for Latinas and Glam Belleza Latina .\n\nCNN found the states where Google users searched the most for the term Latino from 2011-2014 were Virginia, California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and New York.  The states with the highest Google searches for Hispanic were New Mexico, Texas, District of Columbia, Florida and Arizona.\n\nGoogle searches for Hispanic have declined over the past 10 years, while searches for Latino have remained steady and even seen an uptick in the past two to three years. The only exception each year was during Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\n\"Groups like Latinos in Social Media and niche Latino sites that have launched recently have a lot to do with Latino being used more than Hispanic, but Latino refers to flavors, people and music. You don't hear people say 'Hispanic music,' they say 'Latino music,' \" said Joe Kutchera, author of \"Latino Link: Building Brands Online with Hispanic Communities and Content.\"\n\n\"Latino media outlets have turned to Latino more because the term feels more inclusive, but that can always change. Younger generations are generally more accepting and don't care as much about these labels,\" Kutchera added.\n\nSuch was the case for Lance Rios when he started the popular Latino-based community Facebook page Being Latino . He said he realized Latino held more weight than Hispanic because it was a term embraced within the community.\n\n\"Twenty years ago Chicanos were Chicanos, and Boricuas were Boricuas but now it's different,\" Rios said. \"Latino encompasses many more who can identify with having parents from different parts of Latin America.\"\n\nHispanics in the United States: Fast Facts\n\nThat annoying question: Where are you from?\n\nMarco Perez, founder of the United Latino Professionals, has developed a good-natured sense of humor when he is asked a question that many Latinos often hear:  Where are you from?\n\nPerez said the question doesn't bother him much anymore.\n\n\"I just say I was born in Guatemala but was raised in New York since I was toddler so I identify myself more with 'American' culture,\" Perez said.\n\nIt's clearly not a one-word answer for Perez but not as complicated as some make it out to be.\n\n\"Their reaction always depends on who it is, their level of education and what part of the country I'm in. But I get reactions such as, 'No, I mean ethnic origin,' but in many cases they simply leave it at an awkward, 'Oh OK,'\" Perez said.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why this question is irritating to many Latinos. It implies that the person being asked is a foreigner when he or she, or his or her family, could have easily been in the United States for several generations.\n\nIt also inevitably puts Latinos in a box, making them feel singled out and forced to justify their American-ness.\n\nBefore I knew any better, the question also made me feel foreign, so I always had my Americana spiel ready to go: \"Yes, I'm Peruvian but I was born and raised in New Jersey. And, I went to Rutgers, and watched 'Full House' and 'Saved by the Bell' growing up. I love apple pie and spend Fourth of July weekend down the shore, etc.\"\n\n'Where are you from?' is not the right question\n\nThe only time I feel like I'm identifying with the Hispanic or Latino label is when I'm around non-Latinos or filling out the census survey.\n\nLiving in two worlds\n\nWith all the \"Latino boom\" talk, I realized I am a part of the population that isn't just part of the changing face of America but that also is altering its economic landscape.\n\nYou've heard the statistics: Latinos have a $1 trillion buying power only expected to grow. The Latino vote helped Obama get elected in 2008 and 2012. They're one out of every six people, one out of every four babies born each year.\n\nThe Hispanic population accounted for more than half of the country's growth in the past decade as well as 95% of the teen population growth through 2020 . And, by 2050, Latinos are projected to make up 30% of the U.S. population.\n\nThat's what Hispanic marketing expert Chiqui Cartagena calls the duality of the Latino reality.\n\n\"From the grocery aisle where you pick up your Corona beer and your dulce de leche ice cream, to the Billboard charts where Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez routinely dominate, to the lunch you order at Chipotle .... the Latino effect is everywhere,\" wrote Cartagena, the vice president of corporate marketing for Univision Cartagena, in an op-ed for CNN .\n\nWhen companies talk about the Hispanic market , they are referring to the bilingual Latino who has embraced both cultures, eats pizza and tacos, and the growing share of Hispanics who prefer to consume their news in English from television, print, radio and Internet outlets .\n\nBut Pew also found that most Latinos acknowledge the importance of speaking Spanish and found that more than 34 million Hispanics ages 5 and older spoke Spanish at home , which may be the reason why English and Spanish have influenced each other so much.\n\nFewer Latinos will speak Spanish, more non-Latinos will, report says\n\nLanguage isn't the only aspect of Latino culture to keep in mind when speaking to this growing community in the United States. It's also important to know that Latinos are not a monolithic culture.\n\nWhile a large percentage of the Hispanic market is of Mexican origin, there are still two dozen other nationalities that make up America's Latino population. Also, Latinos come in all shapes, complexions and sizes.\n\nGlenda Guevara has little patience for stereotypes these days.\n\n\"I now take the 'where are you from?' as a teaching moment,\" said Guevara, who was born in El Salvador. \"But I do get furious when I'm told that I can't be from El Salvador because I don't fit the 'look.'\"\n\nWithout completely losing her cool, Guevara continually responds by asking, \"What exactly does an El Salvadoran look like? Please tell me what my people should look like?\"\n\nLatin America's diverse racial demographics are the result of a mixed-race background of European, African and indigenous cultures .\n\nAll the attention Latinos have gotten over the years has come with its fair share of stereotypes and misconceptions, some I'm able to laugh off and some I wish I could wave a magic wand and change immediately, like:\n\nBeing asked to say something in Spanish (Nope, I'm not here solely for your entertainment.), to explain where exactly Peru is (Don't admit the little geography you know.), if I know someone you once met in Peru (It's a big country, the chances are impossible.), if I'm a U.S. citizen (That's never, ever appropriate.), and - my personal favorite - introducing me to your friend from a Latin American country because you believe we will hit it off. (Common backgrounds don't necessarily mean you are introducing me to my future bestie.)\n\nThese awkward and often staggering encounters only confirm how ambiguous Latinos' collective identity is to those on the outside.\n\nBut if waving that wand meant having to alter who I am or how I move seamlessly between two worlds, then I'd hold back. I can only hope that as the Hispanic community continues to grow, so will a more defined identity.\n\nStudy: Hispanics show increasing cultural, economic and social diversity\n\nHow do you identify and why?

And, by 2050, Latinos are projected to make up 30% of the U.S. population.\n\nThat's what Hispanic marketing expert Chiqui Cartagena calls the duality of the Latino reality.\n\n\"From the grocery aisle where you pick up your Corona beer and your dulce de leche ice cream, to the Billboard charts where Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez routinely dominate, to the lunch you order at Chipotle .... the Latino effect is everywhere,\" wrote Cartagena, the vice president of corporate marketing for Univision Cartagena, in an op-ed for CNN .\n\nWhen companies talk about the Hispanic market , they are referring to the bilingual Latino who has embraced both cultures, eats pizza and tacos, and the growing share of Hispanics who prefer to consume their news in English from television, print, radio and Internet outlets .\n\nBut Pew also found that most Latinos acknowledge the importance of speaking Spanish and found that more than 34 million Hispanics ages 5 and older spoke Spanish at home , which may be the reason why English and Spanish have influenced each other so much.\n\nFewer Latinos will speak Spanish, more non-Latinos will, report says\n\nLanguage isn't the only aspect of Latino culture to keep in mind when speaking to this growing community in the United States. It's also important to know that Latinos are not a monolithic culture.\n\nWhile a large percentage of the Hispanic market is of Mexican origin, there are still two dozen other nationalities that make up America's Latino population. Also, Latinos come in all shapes, complexions and sizes.\n\nGlenda Guevara has little patience for stereotypes these days.\n\n\"I now take the 'where are you from?' as a teaching moment,\" said Guevara, who was born in El Salvador. \"But I do get furious when I'm told that I can't be from El Salvador because I don't fit the 'look.'\"\n\nWithout completely losing her cool, Guevara continually responds by asking, \"What exactly does an El Salvadoran look like? Please tell me what my people should look like?\"\n\nLatin America's diverse racial demographics are the result of a mixed-race background of European, African and indigenous cultures .\n\nAll the attention Latinos have gotten over the years has come with its fair share of stereotypes and misconceptions, some I'm able to laugh off and some I wish I could wave a magic wand and change immediately, like:\n\nBeing asked to say something in Spanish (Nope, I'm not here solely for your entertainment.), to explain where exactly Peru is (Don't admit the little geography you know.), if I know someone you once met in Peru (It's a big country, the chances are impossible.), if I'm a U.S. citizen (That's never, ever appropriate.), and - my personal favorite - introducing me to your friend from a Latin American country because you believe we will hit it off. (Common backgrounds don't necessarily mean you are introducing me to my future bestie.)\n\nThese awkward and often staggering encounters only confirm how ambiguous Latinos' collective identity is to those on the outside.\n\nBut if waving that wand meant having to alter who I am or how I move seamlessly between two worlds, then I'd hold back. I can only hope that as the Hispanic community continues to grow, so will a more defined identity.\n\nStudy: Hispanics show increasing cultural, economic and social diversity\n\nHow do you identify and why? Please share your thoughts in the comments!\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Here's what it means to be Afro-Latino in America\n\nJoel Alvarado was 6 years old when his mother pulled him aside and asked him to be discreet as he was getting ready to meet his grandmother in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"She made me aware that my grandmother was much darker than my other relatives, especially from her side of the family, and she didn't want me to say anything out of turn or something about her skin color,\" said Alvarado, 50, the executive vice president of the Atlanta-based government relations firm Ohio River South.\n\n\"These are my blood relatives, what does that make me?\" he recalls thinking.\n\nAt that moment, Alvarado learned that his grandmother and himself were Black Latinos or Afro-Latinos, a group that historically has faced prejudice within Latino communities in the United States and abroad.\n\nRelated article Census release shows America is more diverse and more multiracial than ever\n\nIn the last decade, the number of people across the US who identify as Black and Hispanic has increased 11.6%, according to a CNN analysis of census data. The national debate around race along with a growing trend of young Black Latinos embracing their roots in a way that older generations may have not are some of the factors behind the uptick, experts say.\n\nAfrican roots in Latin America can be traced to the 1500s when the majority of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas landed in the Caribbean.

He says it took him years to understand he could equally claim both African and Latin American roots simultaneously.\n\n\"I felt like the world was telling me 'you can either be Black or Latino, but you couldn't be both,' and I didn't know how to explain being both,\" he said.\n\nThe Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn where he grew up was very diverse, he said, but his lack of fluency in Spanish created a self-imposed pressure to figure out how he could immerse himself in the Latino community.\n\n\"I would ask myself 'am I fully accepted?

As a student, all but one of his peers saw him as a Black man, he recalls.\n\n\"When I came to Morehouse in '91, there was no 'oh Joel's from Puerto Rico.' Everybody just saw me and said 'that's a light-skin Black dude,'\" he said.\n\nAs a history major at Morehouse, Alvarado researched the transatlantic slave trade as well the expansive history of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Later, he discovered there were Puerto Ricans on Morehouse's dive team in the 1950s, so both parts of his identity had a place at his school.\n\nDelving into that history helped him understand who he was as an Afro-Latino, and it gave him a newfound ability to define and vocalize his identity.\n\n\"You can be Latino and Black and that doesn't take away from one or the other, and they shouldn't have to make you choose between one or the other, you can be both because they're both representative of who you are as a human being,\" Alvarado said.\n\nNydia Guity remembers people calling her \"esa morena\" in a disparaging tone. The Spanish phrase translates to \"that Black Girl.\"\n\nGuity, 34, was born and raised in the Bronx to Honduran immigrants. She was one of a few Black students - and one of the few darker skinned students - in her elementary school bilingual class. She recalled Spanish-speakers saying \"dehumanizing and disgusting\" things about Black people around her because they assumed she wouldn't understand.\n\nBut once it was known she understood Spanish, she said \"people suddenly felt comfortable to share things about Blackness in my presence that, for me, are super offensive. It's like 'you do know that I'm Black, right?'\"\n\nUnlike Alvarado, who was also teased as a child for his racial ambiguity but ultimately came to embrace his full Afro-Latino identity, Guity said she's exhausted of having to explain to people why she can speak Spanish fluently. For her, saying she's Afro-Latina erases her Blackness.\n\n\"I'm not any less Black because I speak Spanish,\" she said.\n\nInstead of calling herself Afro Latina, Guity says she prefers to identify with the African subculture within Honduras called Garifuna .

Only 17% of the population chose White as the only racial category while more than half said they were more than one race.\n\nRelated article Afro Latinx children's books are still too rare.

But among those who identified as Hispanic, 63% selected at least one of these categories compared to 37% who chose \"some other race.\"\n\nMany respondents offered write-in responses such as \"Mexican,\" Hispanic\" or \"Latin American,\" according to the Census Bureau.\n\nWhile some use the term Afro-Latino to merely reclaim their roots, Abadía-Rexach said the term should also be used to challenge the anti-Black attitudes within Latinx communities in the US and abroad.\n\n\"People should answer the race question in a political way, how you see yourself, but also how you are treated,\" said Abadía-Rexach, adding that she asserts her identity as a Black woman as a means of making a political statement.\n\nGrowing up, Erica-Antoinette Castillo Slaton, 40, said she always felt like she was \"other.\" Outside, she was a Black American, but at home, she was the daughter of immigrant parents from Belize and Honduras.\n\nIt wasn't until she turned 18 and left for college that she embraced how different she was, starting with changing the pronunciation of her (maiden) last name.\n\nWhat was formerly pronounced in English as Castillo - the double L sounds like \"jello\" - transformed into the Spanish pronunciation Castillo, where the double L sounds like a \"Y\" like the word \"pollo\" or chicken in Spanish.\n\n\"I decided to no longer assimilate, but to provide it as is in terms of who I was,\" Slaton said. Her parents were more concerned with working and supporting their children, she said, than how their name was pronounced.\n\nChanging the pronunciation of her last name led Slaton to eventually see herself as an Afro-Latina woman, something that was unfamiliar to her parents. Slaton said neither of her parents identify as Afro-Latino, even though they could be considered such by definition of their racial and ethnic background.\n\nHer mother identifies as Belizean, Honduran and Garifuna, but has never been in a space to consider whether she was Afro-Latina, Slaton said. Her father identifies as Belizean and Garifuna.\n\n\"I think people have the freedom and the right to identify with what they want and it doesn't have to look a certain way to those of us on the outside,\" Slaton said.\n\nWhile most of the adults who spoke to CNN came to terms with their racial and ethnic identity at a much later age, 16-year-old Nation Shabazz Alvarado is well aware of his diverse heritage.\n\nUnlike his father Joel Alvarado, Nation learned at a fairly young age that his father was a darker-skinned Afro-Latino man from Puerto Rico and his mother was a biracial woman - Black and White - from Alabama.\n\n\"It's confusing for anybody to understand it - especially someone who's younger - by themselves, luckily I have parents who kind of know this,\" Nation said. \"They showed me - especially at a younger age - who I am and what I am. That really helped me in the long run, knowing where I fit and knowing who I am.\"\n\nWhen Nation heard the story about his father meeting his grandmother for the first time, he says it confused him and made him wonder what stopped his relatives from showing Alvarado  \"who he really was\" at a younger age. Now, he understands that his grandparents and parents lived during a time where racism, colorism and segregation were more prevalent in both the US and Latin America.\n\n\"Racism, in itself, is like a virus. It's spread until eventually there is antibiotic that takes it out. The antibiotic is the new generation that's coming in,\" Nation said.\n\n\"There's a lot more people like me coming into the world,\" he added.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "My encounter with anti-Latino racism\n\nEditor's Note: Nick Valencia is a national news desk editor and former head of the CNN Spanish Desk. He has reported extensively on the drug war in Mexico for CNN. He is also the president of the Atlanta chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Soledad O'Brien reports on a Latina boxer about to face the fight of her life as she attempts to make her Olympic dream a reality. Watch \"Latino In America: In Her Corner,\" at 8 p.m. ET/PT Saturday, October 1.\n\nNick Valencia says a woman yelled racist words at him at a concert in Atlanta\n\nHe'd been speaking Spanish to new acquaintances; her treatment left him speechless\n\nGrowing anti-Latino sentiment in U.S. is aimed at both immigrants and citizens, he says\n\nValencia: I'm third-generation Mexican-American; human, like my new friends. And I'm home\n\n\"Go home!\" she yelled at me. \"Why don't you go back home to Mexico before you ruin this country like you ruined your own!\"\n\nI was standing in a crowd at the Music Midtown festival in Atlanta, where I live. A few minutes earlier I'd met a group of five people who'd been standing in front of me - here from Mexico City - and I had begun speaking Spanish with them.\n\nAtlanta has a growing Latino community, and I am actively involved. Whenever I get the chance to speak to someone in Spanish here, I introduce myself.  My new acquaintances and I were talking about what a great time we were having and how remarkable the city of Atlanta was for bringing back the festival to Piedmont Park.\n\nAnd that's when I heard the yelling woman next to me.  As if \"go home\" wasn't clear enough, the woman - a 20-something Caucasian - repeated the words in Spanish.\n\n\"Vete!\"\n\nI froze. I didn't quite know what to say, and I didn't want to believe she was talking to me or the group of people I had just met.\n\nAs a third-generation Mexican-American growing up in Los Angeles, I had never encountered such overt racism. In fact, because my family was long since assimilated, among my Latino friends I was always considered the \"pocho\" or \"white boy\" of the group. (As I write this, a part of me knows somewhere in L.A., a friend of mine will be proud to know someone actually considered me Mexican enough to yell \"go home\" at me.)\n\nMy Mexican friends remind me that I am American first, Mexican second and that my English is better than my Spanish.\n\n\"Yes,\" I tell them. \"But I can never walk into a room and be white.\"\n\nEvidently, to some the brown color of my skin means I'm not even American. My friends and family tell me what I experienced that night is a microcosm of what is happening to Latinos across the country. You don't have to look hard to find it. In news stories, in political discourse, on talk radio, in everyday conversation it seems it has become OK to treat Latinos in a negative and antagonistic way - whether they are new immigrants or longtime Americans. The anti-immigration legislation sweeping across the United States has made this plain. People in my Latino networks say they've noticed the change. And now I understand what they mean.\n\nLike many Americans whose grandparents or parents came here from somewhere else, I live at the intersection of my two cultures. I eat tacos, but I love cheeseburgers. I go salsa dancing, and listen to rock n' roll. I speak Spanish and English, and depending on the crowd, sometimes Spanglish. I love my country and my cultural community. My duality is my reality, just like the 50 million other Latinos in the United States.\n\nI have been luckier than many. Before this incident, the closest I'd ever come to blatant racism was in junior high. I was in the jazz band and played first trumpet. One day our jazz band teacher invited in his predecessor,  a local legend who had made Eagle Rock High School's jazz program famous in the 1980s.\n\nThe visiting instructor pointed me out and asked me to play him 16 bars of music. I did, but he quickly interrupted.\n\n\"Stop, stop, stop. I don't want to hear any of that mariachi music. This is jazz.\"\n\nI didn't think anything of it. Instead I felt terrible that the legend standing in front of me didn't think I was good enough. I went home that night, and like every night, at 6:30 p.m. my family sat down for dinner to talk about our day.\n\n\"How was your day, Nicky?\" my dad asked.\n\nSo I told him. Outraged, the next day he went to my principal and filed a formal complaint. The legend didn't come back to visit the jazz program again. Weeks later we received a letter in the mail from him apologizing for his insensitive comments. My family saved the letter.\n\nMy father was hypersensitive to ethnic identity and deeply proud of his Latino heritage. The son of a naturalized immigrant from El Salvador and a Mexican mother from Texas, he grew up in Los Angeles during a time of racial tension. When I was young he would tell me stories of the race riots in his high school, violence against people of color, and awful accounts of the struggle he had to make it as a Mexican-American teen in the 1960s.\n\nHe died when I was 17 years old, but one of the phrases he implanted in my mind before he passed was a statement activist Cesar Chavez made famous:\n\n\"Si se puede\" - \"Yes you can.\"\n\nAnd now, here I was, at 28, with this stranger yelling at me to \"leave.\" I stood there in the middle of a damp crowd on a late Atlanta evening, not comprehending, the wind still and the vibrations of Coldplay's \"Yellow\" filling the space in the air.\n\nI didn't say a thing.\n\nI didn't have to.\n\nThe crowd around us looked in amazement at this woman. Some of them spoke up to her, telling her she was wrong to talk to us like that. The group of people from Mexico City looked at her in disgust and, realizing from the look on my face that I must not be accustomed to what I was hearing, they turned toward me to offer support.\n\nOne of them, a young man, grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air.\n\n\"Estamos aqui,\" he said, which translates to \"We are here.\"\n\nIt was the \"Si se puede\" moment.\n\nThe woman continued to taunt us for some minutes, but when we did not reciprocate her hatred, she stopped.\n\nThe band played a few more songs before ending the set, and the crowd dispersed across the park into the Saturday evening.\n\nAs I walked away, the woman and I locked eyes.\n\n\"I don't think you understand who you said that to,\" I told her. Thinking to myself, I am as American as you are.\n\n\"What,\" she said laughing. \"Are you some kind of celebrity or something?\"\n\nNo. But like the Mexicans I was standing with, I am a human being.  And I am home.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick Valencia.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Blackness and Latinidad are not mutually exclusive. Here's what it means to be Afro-Latino in America\n\nJoel Alvarado was 6 years old when his mother pulled him aside and asked him to be discreet as he was getting ready to meet his grandmother in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"She made me aware that my grandmother was much darker than my other relatives, especially from her side of the family, and she didn't want me to say anything out of turn or something about her skin color,\" said Alvarado, 50, the executive vice president of the Atlanta-based government relations firm Ohio River South.\n\n\"These are my blood relatives, what does that make me?\" he recalls thinking.\n\nAt that moment, Alvarado learned that his grandmother and himself were Black Latinos or Afro-Latinos, a group that historically has faced prejudice within Latino communities in the United States and abroad.\n\nRelated article Census release shows America is more diverse and more multiracial than ever\n\nIn the last decade, the number of people across the US who identify as Black and Hispanic has increased 11.6%, according to a CNN analysis of census data. The national debate around race along with a growing trend of young Black Latinos embracing their roots in a way that older generations may have not are some of the factors behind the uptick, experts say.\n\nAfrican roots in Latin America can be traced to the 1500s when the majority of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas landed in the Caribbean. Intermingling between Africans, indigenous people and the European Spaniards over generations occurred as a result of the slave trade.\n\nThe term traces to the 1970s, when Black activists in Brazil sparked a social political movement to fight for recognition in the country's census because Brazil - at the time - did not recognize its Black citizens in the census, said Solsiree Del Moral, a professor at Amherst College who studies Latin America and the Caribbean modern history.\n\nUltimately, defining what it means to be Afro-Latino is personal and can be subjective, multiple scholars and Afro-Latinos told CNN. They have dark and lighter skin, they are fully bilingual or only speak some Spanish and their families are linked to more than a dozen countries. The term acknowledges that Black Latinos face different struggles than other Latinos, especially those with lighter skin, experts say.\n\nRelated article Multiracial population grew in almost every county in the US. It doesn't mean racism is over\n\nIn the 2020 census , more than 1.3 million people identified as Black and Hispanic, compared to 1.2 million in 2010, census data shows. Mark Hugo Lopez, director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center said it is hard to pinpoint exactly what led to the increase.\n\n\"It may be because of a change in the census form and the way the responses are coded,\" Lopez said. \"It may be people becoming more aware of their identity because of things like DNA tests and so forth and it may be because of the way in which US society has discussed and engaged with issues around race and racial equality over the last 10 years.\"\n\nMany believe the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and its aftermath led to the rise of acceptance in Afro-Latino identity, but Lopez said the increase was a culmination of years of protests, anger and political polarization that took place long before Floyd's death.\n\nGrowing up, Alvarado told others that he was Black. He says it took him years to understand he could equally claim both African and Latin American roots simultaneously.\n\n\"I felt like the world was telling me 'you can either be Black or Latino, but you couldn't be both,' and I didn't know how to explain being both,\" he said.\n\nThe Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn where he grew up was very diverse, he said, but his lack of fluency in Spanish created a self-imposed pressure to figure out how he could immerse himself in the Latino community.\n\n\"I would ask myself 'am I fully accepted? Do Latinos see me as fully Latino or do they just tolerate me?\"' Alvarado said, adding that no one ever did anything to him to make him feel this way.\n\nMorehouse College, a historically Black all-male university in Atlanta, offered Alvarado a chance to understand his identity, he said. As a student, all but one of his peers saw him as a Black man, he recalls.\n\n\"When I came to Morehouse in '91, there was no 'oh Joel's from Puerto Rico.' Everybody just saw me and said 'that's a light-skin Black dude,'\" he said.\n\nAs a history major at Morehouse, Alvarado researched the transatlantic slave trade as well the expansive history of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Later, he discovered there were Puerto Ricans on Morehouse's dive team in the 1950s, so both parts of his identity had a place at his school.\n\nDelving into that history helped him understand who he was as an Afro-Latino, and it gave him a newfound ability to define and vocalize his identity.\n\n\"You can be Latino and Black and that doesn't take away from one or the other, and they shouldn't have to make you choose between one or the other, you can be both because they're both representative of who you are as a human being,\" Alvarado said.\n\nNydia Guity remembers people calling her \"esa morena\" in a disparaging tone. The Spanish phrase translates to \"that Black Girl.\"\n\nGuity, 34, was born and raised in the Bronx to Honduran immigrants. She was one of a few Black students - and one of the few darker skinned students - in her elementary school bilingual class. She recalled Spanish-speakers saying \"dehumanizing and disgusting\" things about Black people around her because they assumed she wouldn't understand.\n\nBut once it was known she understood Spanish, she said \"people suddenly felt comfortable to share things about Blackness in my presence that, for me, are super offensive. It's like 'you do know that I'm Black, right?'\"\n\nUnlike Alvarado, who was also teased as a child for his racial ambiguity but ultimately came to embrace his full Afro-Latino identity, Guity said she's exhausted of having to explain to people why she can speak Spanish fluently. For her, saying she's Afro-Latina erases her Blackness.\n\n\"I'm not any less Black because I speak Spanish,\" she said.\n\nInstead of calling herself Afro Latina, Guity says she prefers to identify with the African subculture within Honduras called Garifuna . These are the descendants of people from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent who were exiled from the island and relocated to Central American countries like Honduras, Nicaragua and Belize.\n\nCarlos Olave, head of the Hispanic Reading Room at the Library of Congress , and María Peña, a spokeswoman for the Library of Congress, said colorism runs deep in the Spanish language. One example of that is the phrase \"mejorar la raza,\" which means to improve the race.\n\n\"In the popular culture there's still that belief - whether it's subconscious or not - that if you marry someone lighter than you, you have a better chance for upward mobility,\" Peña said, adding there are certain parts of Latin America where social mobility depends on the complexion of a person's skin.\n\nA 2019 Pew Research survey highlighted how darker skin color is associated with more frequent experiences of discrimination among Latinos, including people questioning their intelligence, being the subject of jokes and unfair treatment from police.\n\n\"Darker-skinned Latinos were more likely across every single discrimination experience we asked about to say that had happened to them in the year before the survey than lighter-skinned Latinos,\" said Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, many Latinos struggle to see themselves as Black or of African descent because they link it to slavery, racism and racial violence and many identified as White in the census for decades, said Bárbara Abadía-Rexach, a Latina/Latino studies professor at San Francisco State University.\n\nAfter more than 75% of people in Puerto Rico identified as White in the 2010 survey, Colectivo Ilé, an anti-racism group of educators and organizers, launched a campaign to encourage citizens to self-identify as Black or more than one race in the 2020 survey.\n\nAbadía-Rexach, who was part of the campaign, said she encountered many people on the island who said they didn't have to answer the race question because they could write in \"Puerto Rican\" on the census question about Hispanic and Latino origin.\n\nPuerto Rico was one of the places where the most pronounced growth of multiracial population was reported in the 2020 census. Only 17% of the population chose White as the only racial category while more than half said they were more than one race.\n\nRelated article Afro Latinx children's books are still too rare. These four authors are trying to change that\n\nOlave and other experts said there are Latinos who, no matter their complexion, don't acknowledge their African roots and have a hard time choosing a race.\n\n\"I'm not Black, I'm ...\" Dominican, Puerto Rican, Colombian or any country of origin is common because some people identify more with their experience rather than their race, Olave said.\n\nIn the 2010 census , 94% of the US population chose at least one of the five standard, government-defined racial categories - White, Black, Asian, American Indian or Pacific Islander. But among those who identified as Hispanic, 63% selected at least one of these categories compared to 37% who chose \"some other race.\"\n\nMany respondents offered write-in responses such as \"Mexican,\" Hispanic\" or \"Latin American,\" according to the Census Bureau.\n\nWhile some use the term Afro-Latino to merely reclaim their roots, Abadía-Rexach said the term should also be used to challenge the anti-Black attitudes within Latinx communities in the US and abroad.\n\n\"People should answer the race question in a political way, how you see yourself, but also how you are treated,\" said Abadía-Rexach, adding that she asserts her identity as a Black woman as a means of making a political statement.\n\nGrowing up, Erica-Antoinette Castillo Slaton, 40, said she always felt like she was \"other.\" Outside, she was a Black American, but at home, she was the daughter of immigrant parents from Belize and Honduras.\n\nIt wasn't until she turned 18 and left for college that she embraced how different she was, starting with changing the pronunciation of her (maiden) last name.\n\nWhat was formerly pronounced in English as Castillo - the double L sounds like \"jello\" - transformed into the Spanish pronunciation Castillo, where the double L sounds like a \"Y\" like the word \"pollo\" or chicken in Spanish.\n\n\"I decided to no longer assimilate, but to provide it as is in terms of who I was,\" Slaton said. Her parents were more concerned with working and supporting their children, she said, than how their name was pronounced.\n\nChanging the pronunciation of her last name led Slaton to eventually see herself as an Afro-Latina woman, something that was unfamiliar to her parents. Slaton said neither of her parents identify as Afro-Latino, even though they could be considered such by definition of their racial and ethnic background.\n\nHer mother identifies as Belizean, Honduran and Garifuna, but has never been in a space to consider whether she was Afro-Latina, Slaton said. Her father identifies as Belizean and Garifuna.\n\n\"I think people have the freedom and the right to identify with what they want and it doesn't have to look a certain way to those of us on the outside,\" Slaton said.\n\nWhile most of the adults who spoke to CNN came to terms with their racial and ethnic identity at a much later age, 16-year-old Nation Shabazz Alvarado is well aware of his diverse heritage.\n\nUnlike his father Joel Alvarado, Nation learned at a fairly young age that his father was a darker-skinned Afro-Latino man from Puerto Rico and his mother was a biracial woman - Black and White - from Alabama.\n\n\"It's confusing for anybody to understand it - especially someone who's younger - by themselves, luckily I have parents who kind of know this,\" Nation said. \"They showed me - especially at a younger age - who I am and what I am. That really helped me in the long run, knowing where I fit and knowing who I am.\"\n\nWhen Nation heard the story about his father meeting his grandmother for the first time, he says it confused him and made him wonder what stopped his relatives from showing Alvarado  \"who he really was\" at a younger age. Now, he understands that his grandparents and parents lived during a time where racism, colorism and segregation were more prevalent in both the US and Latin America.\n\n\"Racism, in itself, is like a virus. It's spread until eventually there is antibiotic that takes it out. The antibiotic is the new generation that's coming in,\" Nation said.\n\n\"There's a lot more people like me coming into the world,\" he added.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "5 charts that illustrate why being Hispanic or Latino is more than speaking Spanish\n\nJames Bosquez grew up being singled out by his cousins for only speaking English and prompting surprised looks from his peers for not getting good grades in Spanish class.\n\nThe 39-year-old standup comedian says those reactions used to bother him as a young boy, but he learned that not speaking the language didn't make him less Latino.\n\nBosquez represents the complexity of Latinos, a diverse group whose presence in the United States predates the country's current borders.\n\n\"We've been across the Rio Grande since my great grandmother's migrated (from Reynosa, Mexico) so we go some four of five generations,\" said Bosquez, who now lives in Portland.\n\nThe way Latinos self-identify, vote and speak widely varies. They are often the target of anti-immigrant taunts and face economic, health and education disparities . During the Covid-19 pandemic , they have experienced higher rates of infections as well as pay cuts and job losses.\n\nHere's how Hispanic and Latino communities in America are far from a monolith.\n\nThere are 62 million people in the US who trace their ancestry or descent to Mexico, parts of the Caribbean, Central and South America as well as Spain, US Census data shows.\n\nIn the 1970s, the federal government adapted the term \"Hispanic\" to describe this group but a 2019 Pew Research survey found that half of Latinos in the US most often describe themselves by their family's country of origin or heritage.\n\nWhile the share of Latinos of Mexican descent is considerably large with more than 37 million people, there are more than a dozen other origin groups. Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans are among some of the largest groups.\n\nThe Latino or Hispanic population currently makes up about 19% of the US population . Its size is the result of decades of steady growth.\n\nIn the past decade, the total Hispanic population grew 23% across the US. In California, the group officially became the largest racial or ethnic group in the state for the first time, data from the 2020 census shows. The group represents 39.4% of Californians, an increase from 37.6% in 2010. The non-Hispanic White population in California was 34.7% in 2020.\n\nWhile there are large concentrations of Latinos in the Southwest, there are fast-growing Latino communities in the Midwest, along the East coast and the South.\n\nNorth Dakota, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont have seen the largest growth of the Hispanic population since 2010 compared to other states, according to a CNN analysis of census data.\n\nIn North Dakota, the Hispanic population saw an 148% increase - something that experts say was partly the result of the oil and construction industry in the state.\n\nKevin Iverson, a demographer with the North Dakota Department of Commerce, said the Bakken oil boom attracted thousands of workers, including many Latinos to the state in the past decade.\n\nLatinos are overwhelmingly represented in the mining, transportation and construction industry, Iverson says, and they seem to be second or third generation Americans. They make up to 5% of the state's labor force, a number that has grown over the past 20 years from zero, he said.\n\nWhen you think about Latinos, think about youth.\n\nAt least a third of Latinos in the US are under 18 years old and 41% are between the ages of 18 and 44, according to Census data.\n\nThe Hispanic population has the youngest median age - 29.8 years - of any major racial or ethnic group in the country. The median age for non-Hispanic White people is 43.7 years, and 34.6 years for non-Hispanic Black people, according to data from the 2019 American Community Survey.\n\nAna Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center focusing on Hispanics, demographics and immigration, said most young Latinos were born in the US and they are more multiethnic and multiracial.\n\n\"A lot of people when they think about Hispanics, they think about immigrants and they think about Spanish speakers but young Hispanics for the most part they speak English,\" Gonzalez-Barrera said, adding that there are more Latinos being born in the US than those coming from abroad.\n\nYoung Latinos are more likely to have higher educational attainment, are fully proficient in English and have more opportunities opening for them compared to older Latinos, Gonzalez-Barrera said.\n\nHistorically, college enrollment among White non-Latino students has been higher than any other demographic group in the US, but Latino students have made big inroads in part because of their youth.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2018, the number of Latino students rose to 3.4 million from 1.4 million, marking the highest growth in all race and ethnic groups, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, some Latino students have been forced to decide between staying in school and working to help their families survive the economic recession, leading to a decline in enrollment and retention, according to Excelencia in Education, a national organization focused on accelerating Latino students' success in higher education.\n\nLatinos are a complex and diverse electorate with the power of influencing key elections and their support varies in different parts of the country.\n\nHispanic and Latinos were particularly influential in the last presidential election, where turnout increased in five swing states that flipped from former President Donald Trump in 2016 to President Joe Biden in 2020. However, strong Hispanic turnout also helped Trump keep Florida and Texas , where counties with large Hispanic populations voted Republican in historically high numbers.\n\nIn California, Latinos make up an estimated 30% of all eligible voters , a significant portion that can easily make or break the success of any Democratic politician. Earlier this month, a mix of campaigns, super PACs and organizations from both parties worked for weeks to turnout Latino voters for the election to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"You can't win California without reaching out to Latinos, so from the get-go there was an effort to connect with Latinos and Latino leaders to emphasize how important the recall was,\" Angelica Salas, the head of CHIRLA Action Fund, an immigrant rights organization that worked against recalling Newsom told CNN at the time.\n\nAdvocates and experts said the Latino voters played a major role in Newsom's defeating the effort to remove him from office. Data from the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Initiative shows that a significant number of Latino voters chose no in Orange, Merced and Madera counties, which are considered traditional Republican strongholds.\n\nLatinos are building businesses at a faster rate than the national average. Yet, they struggle to secure outside financing.\n\nThe number of small Latino-owned businesses has grown 34% over the last 10 years, compared to just 1% for all other small businesses, according to the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the number of Latino small businesses increased in 45 states, according to a SLEI report.\n\nIn 2018, there were more than 331,000 Hispanic-owned businesses, which made about 5.8% of all businesses. They had an estimated $455.6 billion in annual sales and had about 3 million employees, according to the Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was a major blow for most small businesses and those owned by Latinos and other people of color were hit hardest, according to an analysis from the 12 banks of the Federal Reserve.\n\nLast year, the Federal Reserve conducted a survey of nearly 10,000 small businesses and found that people of color had more trouble than other applicants in getting approved for financing.\n\nOnly 61% of Latino-owned firms surveyed received all the funding they requested through the federal Paycheck Protection Program , which offered forgivable loans to small businesses to make payroll and pay some operating expenses. Among White-owned businesses, 79% reported getting their full ask.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The Museum does not use racial or ethnic classifications or preferences in selecting awardees for the Undergraduate Internship.\"\n\nThe program has also agreed to add language to its scoring rubric saying the internship \"is equally open to students of all races and ethnicities. Reviewers should not give preference or restrict selection based on race or ethnicity,\" according to the settlement.\n\n\"Every student who is interested in this area of museum studies should have the opportunity to compete for an internship without their race being a factor,\" Blum said in the statement. \"Corporations, law firms, academia, and cultural institutions must end these kinds of unlawful, racially exclusive programs and policies.\"\n\nThe language added to the program's website and scoring rubric as part of the settlement \"spells out what had been our practice already,\" David Coronado, a spokesperson for the National Museum of the American Latino said in an email to CNN.\n\n\"The National Museum of the American Latino reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all internship applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity,\" Coronado said.\n\nThe Smithsonian lawsuit was among several legal challenges Blum filed since the Supreme Court case that gutted affirmative action. Last month, the Supreme Court rejected a request from Blum's group, Students for Fair Admissions, to temporarily block the US Military Academy at West Point from race-conscious admissions, CNN previously reported .\n\nRelated article What is DEI and why is it dividing America?\n\nBlum is currently in a legal battle with the Fearless Fund, a Black women-owned venture capitalist fund, over its grant program that offers funding exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs. In August, Blum also sued two international law firms over their diversity fellowships, but he later dropped one of the lawsuits after the firm decided to open its fellowship to all associates.\n\nThe lawsuits come amid a string of attacks against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in corporate America, schools and higher education in recent months.\n\nBlack business leaders and DEI experts have told CNN Blum's lawsuits stand to undo decades of progress toward leveling the playing field for Black and brown people in various job fields. DEI programs, they say, are being created to foster safer, more inclusive work environments for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations and religious identities.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story gave the wrong first name for a spokesperson for the National Museum of the American Latino.

      "text": "Democrats need Latino voters - but fret too many will skip the midterms\n\nLatino voters are angry at President Donald Trump. But that doesn't mean their anger will carry Democrats into House and Senate majorities in November.\n\nDemocrats had hoped that Trump's actions - from attacking Mexicans at the outset of his presidential campaign to separating children from their parents at the southern border - would galvanize Latinos who have historically skipped midterm elections.\n\nNow, with just three weeks before the election, and early voting started in most key states, some Democrats are seeing warning signs that the anti-Trump sentiment isn't translating into votes with Latinos the way it has with women and African-Americans - and that some candidates in key races have ignored the expensive and time-consuming task of turning out new Latino voters.\n\n\"People hate Donald Trump, but by itself, that isn't going to do it. You have to have the right messenger and the right message,\" said Cristóbal Alex, the Latino Victory Fund president and Hillary Clinton campaign veteran.\n\nPrivately, Democratic strategists say they fear their candidates in several key races are failing to reach Latinos. Among those they are worried about: Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona Senate candidate who has cast what progressives see as troubling votes on immigration issues, might have to rely on Democratic gubernatorial hopeful David Garcia to reach Latinos. And Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, whose re-election campaign got off to a sluggish start as Republican Gov. Rick Scott beat him to the airwaves - though he has recently made an increased effort to court Puerto Ricans in Florida.\n\nRelated article No, you're not crazy. There are way more campaign ads about immigration this year\n\nSeveral congressional races concern Democrats, too, with heavily Latino districts in California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and Nevada potentially determining which party controls the House next year. At the top of the list is Florida's Miami-based 27th District, where former Bill Clinton health and human services secretary Donna Shalala - who does not speak Spanish - is trailing badly among Latino voters against Republican broadcast journalist Maria Elvira Salazar in a majority-Hispanic district that Hillary Clinton won by 16 percentage points in 2016.\n\nIn Texas, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the online fundraising record-smasher challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, is a fluent Spanish-speaker who has campaigned in regions Democrats have ignored for decades. He's \"an honorary Latino,\" said Alex, a fellow El Paso native.\n\nBut a troubling sign for Democrats came in September, when Republicans won a state Senate special election in a heavily Latino district Clinton won by 12 points in 2016.\n\n\"All this talk about a 'blue wave'? Well, the tide is out,\" Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at the GOP candidate's victory party that night.\n\nPolls have also shown O'Rourke's name identification lower among Latino voters, and have him performing worse with Latinos than Clinton did two years earlier. Cruz, who is of Cuban heritage, has approached or hit 40% with Latinos in some polls - denying O'Rourke the sort of overwhelming margin he'd need to win the state.\n\n\"Texas is a no-vote state. If Latinos turned out, they could determine the direction of that state,\" said Jessica Reeves, the chief operating officer of VotoLatino, a left-leaning nonpartisan group that registered more than 100,000 voters this cycle.\n\nFor years, Democrats have hoped that the growing non-white population would remake the American political landscape in their favor - turning red bastions in the Sun Belt like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into swing states and guaranteeing Democratic victories in Florida and Nevada.\n\nThat hasn't happened - in part because white voters have abandoned Democrats almost as fast as Latinos have registered to vote. That explains why Trump later this week will visit rural Elko, Nevada, instead of a diverse population center like Las Vegas.\n\nAnother problem: Latinos still vote at much lower rates than other Americans. In 2016, Latinos made up 28% of the voting-eligible population in Texas but just 20% of the electorate - people who actually turned out to vote - according to the Census's Current Population Survey. In Arizona, Latinos are 25% of the voting-eligible population but were just 20% of the electorate. There were drop-offs in California, Florida and Nevada, too - all states with marquee midterm races.\n\nThe makeup of each state's Latino electorate can vary widely. Florida is rich with conservative Cubans and Democratic-leaning Puerto Ricans. The Latino populations of states like Texas and Arizona feature United States-born children of more recent Mexican immigrants.\n\nProgressive groups have mounted massive campaigns to register more Latino voters over the last two years. Democrats believe that some efforts - like the Texas Organizing Project in Harris County, the home of Houston - have actually changed the demographics of the electorate in time for the midterms.\n\n\"There's no data at all to suggest that Republicans are improving their image or that they're gaining any ground with Latino voters. The big question is just going to be, how high is the Latino turnout?\" said Matt Barreto, the co-founder of Latino Decisions.\n\nCandidates \"need to throw away their likely voter model that their consultant gave them, and they need to start contacting people who normally do not get contacted - the people who normally get ignored.\"\n\nSome Republicans concede they face an enthusiasm problem headed into the midterms, too.\n\nJazmina Saavedra, a spokeswoman for Latinos for Trump in California, said the GOP is not \"doing their job\" in the state in energizing voters.\n\n\"We need to make sure that all the Republican registered voters go out and vote, and I bet you we can make a difference,\" she said.\n\nAt the root of Democrats' challenge with Latino voters, strategists said, is connecting national events with the outcomes of local elections.\n\n\"If we're able to connect with them, that goes a long way,\" said Ammar Campa-Najjar, the Democrat challenging California Rep. Duncan Hunter in San Diego's suburbs. \"Minimal engagement could go a long way with the community - it's right at the cusp.\"\n\nCampa-Najjar is of Mexican and Palestinian heritage, and being a Latino candidate has helped, he said. As has hiring a \"Dreamer\" as his campaign manager, which he said has given his campaign a persuasive voice to allay the concerns of young potential voters who fear that by registering, they'll put undocumented family members in jeopardy.\n\nHe said he has focused on reaching younger Latinos in a state that sees itself as the heart of the anti-Trump resistance.\n\n\"They'll whip the family,\" Campa-Najjar said. \"Older generation might be disenchanted. But if you can get the kid, you're going to get the household as well.\"\n\nVotoLatino's Reeves said one challenge in turning out Latinos is \"how much information they have and where it's coming from. There's also a lot of misinformation coming out about the Trump administration and what they're doing about family separations.\"\n\nAlex pointed to Democratic Rep. Darren Soto fending off former Rep. Alan Grayson in an Orlando-area House primary this year on a surge of Latino votes as an example of how campaigns can court those voters. Soto was endorsed by the mayor of San Juan - an influential voice for Puerto Rican voters - and ran what Alex called a \"culturally relevant\" campaign with caravans and party buses.\n\n\"In primaries where Latino turnout did not meet expectations, it's generally where the candidate hasn't spent enough time dealing with the community and talking about issues that matter to the community,\" Alex said. \"Or the investments just weren't there.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Latinos are reimagining Hispanic Heritage Month to highlight diversity\n\nLatinos descend from more than 20 different countries, speak different languages, hold different political affiliations, and are of different races.\n\nYet they are categorized by the same few terms.\n\nThis group of people is complex and nuanced, but like many other ethnic and cultural demographics, it is often flattened into one mold.\n\n\"All Latinas don't look like JLo,\" Angel Jones, an Afro-Latina assistant professor of education at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville, said.\n\n\"Afro-Latinos and indigenous Latinos are left out of the celebration. We are not seen. We are not heard. Our identities are not valued or even considered and that absolutely needs to change.\"\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is designated as an all-encompassing celebration of Latinos and their cultures. Yet, many say it falls short of that endeavor. Instead of celebrating Latino cultures, it commodifies them, all the while promulgating a one-dimensional portrait of who Latinos are.\n\nThis \"fetishization\" of Latinos during such a narrow period is why some are calling for the month to be reimagined.\n\n\"I'm proud and grateful for any opportunity I get to share the stories of our people, to highlight the beauty that is our community,\" Jones told Insider.\n\n\"But it's as if we don't exist September 14 and as if we cease to exist October 16.\"\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill establishing Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968. Twenty years after President Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan expanded the acknowledgment a month that would cover several Latin American countries' independence days, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Chile.\n\nIn acknowledging that Latinos are a culturally diverse, vibrant, and growing community, Voices of Color presents 'Mi Gente' - a series that speaks to the intricacies of having Latin American roots.\n\nFrom personal essays about reclaiming Spanish language, exploring how the Puerto Rican diaspora's views towards the island's political status, to the role Hispanic-owned banks serve in making finances more accessible in underserved communities, among others, you'll find that Latino identity is far from one-dimensional.\n\nWith labels like Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx, come joy, pride, pain, and historical baggage. It's only by leaning into and committing to these complexities, that Hispanic Heritage Month can be the impactful period of visibility it's designed to be, experts say.\n\nSo who are the Latinos living in the US?\n\nMexicans compose the biggest share of the Latino population, with more than 60% of Census respondents identifying as members of this ethnic group. But the number of Latinos listing El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as their families' countries of origin has grown in recent years as migration patterns shifted.\n\nPuerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, and Peruvians are also among the top 10 groups with Latin American roots in the US.\n\nAs Hispanic Heritage Month is underway, Latino communities are continuously evolving, staking a greater claim in politics, Hollywood, and other industries and re-conceptualizing the way they identify.\n\nAccording to Census data, 26.7 million Hispanics identified as white in 2010 compared to 12.6 million in 2020.\n\nHispanics are now the largest ethnic and racial group in California and three states - Florida, Texas, and California - saw their Latino populations grow by more than one million in the last 10 years. Perhaps more notable, North Dakota and South Dakota have seen the fastest Latino population growth since 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBecause these communities are so vast, celebrating their nuances during Hispanic Heritage Month becomes difficult, said Ed Morales, author of the book \"Latinx: The New Force in Politics and Culture.\"\n\n\"Outside of people who are involved with Latino advocacy and education and political organizations, the month itself does not seem to be observed by individual Latinos,\" Morales said. \"It's more likely that Latinos celebrate holidays and traditions that are specific to their culture.\"\n\nHe cited the Puerto Rican Day parade, an annual event that takes place in New York City, as one Puerto Ricans are more likely to celebrate than Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nThe name Hispanic Heritage Month itself might be deterring some people from acknowledging it, he added.\n\nThe longstanding debate about whether to label people with Latin American roots as Latino, Hispanic, Latinx , Latine, or by the country their family is descended from has erupted in recent years .\n\nGiven that nearly 15 million Latinos recorded only speaking English, per 2019 American Community Survey data, some argue that Hispanic does not feel like the appropriate moniker. Others don't like the label because they think it elevates their cultures' colonization as Spain colonized most of Latin America.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the US government labeled all Spanish-speaking people and those with Latin American roots as Mexican, even if their family did not descend from Mexico, per the Pew Research Center .\n\nOn the 1970 Census, Latino identity was expanded to include Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, and \"other Spanish.\" Ten years later, Hispanic became part of the public lexicon when the category was used on the 1980 Census.\n\nThe categorization came about in large part because Mexican-American activists lobbied the Census Bureau to change the way Latinos were counted. While the label marked progress in helping Latinos gain political clout, some say it contributes to their erasure.\n\n\"Growing up, I despised being labeled Hispanic,\" wrote journalist Araceli Cruz in an essay for Teen Vogue . \"It made me feel as if my Mexican and indigenous side was being wiped out.\"\n\nYet the term Latinx doesn't make everyone happy either. While many argue it's inclusive of people who do not adhere to the gender binary, others say the term is elitist.\n\nSome haven't even heard of it. Per the Pew Research Center, more than 75% of Latino adults have not heard the term Latinx and of those adults who have, only 3% use it themselves.\n\nGiven that people with cultural connections to Latin America hold divergent thoughts about how to identify themselves, would changing the name of Hispanic Heritage Month be productive?\n\nLaura Gómez, author of the book \"Inventing Latinos: A New Story of American Racism\" and a professor of law at University of California, Los Angeles, said she thinks so.\n\nChanging the name from Hispanic Heritage Month to Latino History Month, in her view, would help crystallize what the month is about: honoring Latinos and drawing attention to the historical and cultural narratives about Latino communities that have often been effaced.\n\n\"Not only would it be consistent with Black History Month, but heritage means a lot of different things to different people,\" Gómez said. \"We do have a common Latino history that we can talk about and look at, given our various countries have been colonized.\"\n\n\"Colonialism and US imperialism are much more concrete than heritage,\" she added.\n\nBut whether changing the name of the month would be more \"symbolic\" than revolutionary remains a question, particularly if there's no meaningful commitment to elevating those who've traditionally been omitted from the celebration.\n\n\"For schools and corporations celebrating, this is not a time to perpetuate stereotypes about Latinidad,\" Jones said, mentioning the commodification of Cinco De Mayo as a poor example of engaging with Latino culture.\n\n\"I think they really need to be mindful about what it is they're doing and why they're doing it.\"\n\nJust as the Hispanic Heritage Month can serve as a way to highlight Latinos, it can also be rife with half-baked attempts at inclusion, said Jones cautioned.\n\nHispandering - which refers to trying to convince Latino voters or consumers for buy-in with often ineffective and offensive marketing - also takes place during this month.\n\n\"While Latinos should be consulted in this kind of educational work, they must be effectively compensated for their intellectual and emotional labor,\" Jones said.\n\nThough Hispanic Heritage Month is imperfect, many say the holiday still serves an important purpose not only in allowing Latinos to appreciate their culture amid the pressure to assimilate, but by increasing visibility of Latino communities.\n\n\"When I was growing up in Albuquerque in the 1970s, I never learned anything about Mexicans or Latinos,\"  Gómez said. \"I ask my students if they have learned this history and only a few of them have ... There's a real need to right the wrongs of this exclusion.\"\n\nThat's why Gómez is a proponent of educational initiatives throughout the month that attempt to fill the gap in inferior historical education about Latinos and other minoritized groups.\n\nAs the month is underway, Voices of Color will continue to spotlight Latino communities and all their invaluable contributions with narratives celebrating the agency of people to define themselves, tell their own stories and shape their own future.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "John Leguizamo jokes that if white actors keep getting cast in Latino roles, he's going to cast himself as Gwyneth Paltrow in a movie about her ski-accident trial\n\nWhile highlighting Latino underrepresentation in Hollywood, John Leguizamo joked that he might take a role from a white actor by playing Gwyneth Paltrow in a movie about her ongoing ski-accident trial.\n\nThe actor, who stars in Prime Video's \"The Power,\" guest hosted \"The Daily Show\" after the departure of its host Trevor Noah . In a recent episode, Leguizamo spoke about the phenomenon of white actors like James Franco, who was cast as Fidel Castro in the film \"Alina of Cuba,\" being cast in Latino roles.\n\n\"Well, guess what? If white people can take our roles, I'm going to take theirs,\" Leguizamo said.\n\n\"When they do the TV series based on Gwyneth Paltrow's ski-accident trial, I'm going to be Gwyneth Paltrow,\" he continued, before launching into an impression of the actor and Goop founder.\n\nA Utah jury found that Paltrow was not at fault in a 2016 ski accident involving retired optometrist Terry Sanderson, Insider reported. Sanderson sued Paltrow in 2019, claiming that she ran into him while distracted and alleging that the incident had resulted in a traumatic brain injury and four broken ribs, Insider previously reported .\n\nPaltrow disputed parts of Sanderson's story and countersued , saying that Sanderson ran into her . The jury found that Sanderson was at fault in the incident, ordering him to pay $1 in damages as Paltrow's team had requested. The trial became social media fodder, with clips from the livestreamed event going viral on TikTok.\n\nLeguizamo has been outspoken about the dearth of Latino representation in Hollywood, writing an open letter to the industry in the Los Angeles Times in 2022 about the long-standing issue.\n\n\"You may think Lin-Manuel Miranda, Bad Bunny, J Lo, Benicio del Toro and I are the only ones, but you are wrong,\" he wrote. \"There are millions of Latinos, and we were just among the few to be allowed through.\"\n\nA USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study published in 2021 of 1,300 of the top-grossing films from 2007 to 2019 found that only 3.5% of leads and co-leads in those films were Hispanic or Latino, despite the group composing 18.7% of the US population.\n\nIn December 2022, Leguizamo told Insider that it was \"odd\" to act opposite white actors like Al Pacino, who played a Latino character in the film \"Carlito's Way.\" He recounted another instance in which he said he was denied a role because of an \"unspoken 'Latin quota'\" in a film, adding that the director told him he couldn't \"have two Latin people in the movie.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times in my career I've been told at auditions that I sound too Latino, not Latino enough, that Latinos don't want to watch other Latinos, all sorts of madness,\" he said on \"The Daily Show.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Latino-focused media company Sonoro wants to be the next 'IP machine' like Warner Bros. TV. Here are its expansion plans and the pitch deck it used to get investment.\n\nThe Latino-focused media company Sonoro has raised $12.5 million from Lerer Hippeau, Greycroft, and others to turn audio content for English and Spanish speakers into film and TV.\n\nNow, it's named new leadership to cash in as marketers increase spending to reach Latino audiences in the US and Mexico.\n\nSonoro was started in 2020 by Josh Weinstein, Camila Victoriano, and Gerónimo Ávila. It notched revenue in the high seven figures in 2023 and expects to be profitable this year, Weinstein said. About 40% of its revenue comes from advertising and brand partnerships from the likes of State Farm, Ulta, and Universal Pictures, who are increasingly underwriting the cost of Sonoro's content in addition to buying ads, he said. The rest comes mainly from licensing its audio and video content to companies like Audible and iHeartMedia . It also hosts live events and sells consumer products tied to its shows.\n\nSonoro wants to capitalize on advertisers looking for high-quality content aimed at Latino audiences, particularly in light of this year's election . To that end, it hired Cesar Martinez, formerly of talent management firm Loaded and Latino-focused media company Mitù, as chief commercial officer. It also promoted Victoriano to chief content officer and Sergio Gonzalez Rothlin to chief growth officer.\n\nSonoro has a busy year ahead on the content front. It's already published 150 podcasts and has 10 set to launch in 2024, including music-driven scripted series \"La Despedida\" starring Romeo Santos and a docuseries looking at lucha libre wrestling. It's also developing a show exploring Latino supernatural lore and a slate of franchises with Paul Telegdy and his Whole Spiel production company . Weinstein said that having developed a large volume of content to date, it has many more listeners to test and promote new shows with, giving them a better shot at success.\n\nIn filmed entertainment, it has 12 projects in the works, including an adaptation of the podcast \"Princess of South Beach\" for Netflix , which \"Jane the Virgin\" star Gina Rodriguez is developing.\n\nIt's also adapting telenovela/K-drama \"Love & Noraebang\" with Nicholas Weinstock, formerly of Apatow Productions and Ben Stiller's Red Hour Productions; and its horror podcast \"Crónicas Obscuras\" for TV and film with Elefantec Global Partners , run by former Televisa chief Jose \"Pepe\" Bastón.\n\nWeinstein envisions Sonoro becoming an IP machine like those of linear TV's heyday.\n\n\"We want to be Warner Bros. Television - to create the most compelling content and be in a position to work with the best production and distribution partners,\" he said.\n\nIt's a jittery time for content producers these days, as studios are spending less on programming and looking for sure bets .\n\nLike other suppliers, Weinstein is taking cues from Netflix's widely pored-over engagement report covering in the first half of 2023. Among other things, the Netflix report showed fully 45% of viewing came from licensed titles like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Suits,\" underscoring the value of enduring content to keep people watching. Weinstein said Sonoro is trying to do its own version of that by leaning into evergreen nonfiction and \"YA soapy\" telenovelas that he sees as having staying power.\n\n\"Things that have a short shelf life that might drive audience and advertisers, that's not our business,\" he said. \"The shiny things will get you only so far.\"\n\nWeinstein also said he viewed Netflix's engagement report as confirmation of Sonoro's business in that several of its top titles starred Latina actors, including \"Wednesday\" and \"The Mother.\"\n\n\"Netflix is putting Latina leads in those roles because it makes money,\" he said. \"That's reflective of the market need we're trying to address.\"\n\nCheck out slides from its most recent pitch deck.\n\nIts model is to make cost-effective content with leading and emerging Latino talent.\n\nThe company says it can meet media companies' need for cost-effective, global audio and video content.\n\nMost of its revenue comes from advertising and brand partnerships as well as licensing fees.\n\nIt wants to emulate the success of Netflix hits like \"Squid Game\" and \"Lupin.\"\n\nIt lists dozens of brands it's worked with, including McDonald's, Nike, and Ulta.\n\nJump to"

He said that the lack of Latin stories in his education made him feel \"less than\" others when there was no need for it.\n\n\"Where's a brown brother in 'Band of Brothers?' he asked, referencing the 2001 mini-series about World War II.

I didn't realize it was so stacked against me,\" he said.\n\n\"The racism is so much more deeply woven into the corporate world,\" he explained of his struggles to get Latin movies made in Hollywood. He said he's only found acceptance in the world of theater.\n\nLeguizamo posted a video critique of Spielberg's 2021 remake of \"West Side Story\" to his Facebook page months after its release.\n\nHe said the film was a \"masterpiece,\" overall and praised the fact that there was authentic casting instead of brownface, but he also said he had \"some issues\" with it, including how many of the characters had accents.\n\nThe \"Ice Age\" star also said that the Latin characters \"had no sense of humor\" in the film, though some of the white characters did.\n\n\"Latin people have so much humor. I mean, we have to. We're all in social services. So, we gotta gave personality,\" he said. He described Latin and Puerto Rican characters in the remake of the classic love story as \"mad\" and \"prideful.\"\n\nSpeaking about the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Latino to MSNBC in 2021, Leguizamo said, \"As a child, I didn't have Latin heroes. We've been erased from history and we made America.\"\n\n\"This myth that we just got here is BS,\" he continued. He said that not seeing Latin people in movies makes the community feel \"nonexistent\" and \"demonized.\"\n\nAs reported by Deadline in 2022 , Leguizamo spoke about colorism in the entertainment industry in the series \"Seen,\" a project by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences that premiered in January 2022.\n\n\"I've benefited from being light skin, and I stayed out of the sun so I could work. I definitely would not go in the sun,\" he told interviewer Nick Barili. \"For years I was so pasty so I could work. All the Latinos who've made it so far, a lot of them were light-skinned.\"\n\nHe said that Afro-Latinos or indigenous Latinos \"don't get a shot\" in the industry.\n\nIn August 2022, Leguizamo posted a screenshot of a Deadline article with news of the casting on Instagram, reacting in the post's caption.\n\n\"How is this still going on? How is Hollywood excluding us but stealing our narratives as well? No more appropriation Hollywood and streamers!\" he wrote in the post. \"Boycott! This F'd up! Plus seriously difficult story to tell without aggrandizement which would b wrong! I don't got a prob with Franco but he ain't Latino!\"\n\nJohn Martinez O'Felan, the producer of \"Alina of Cuba,\" told The Hollywood Reporter that he respected Leguizamo but disagreed with him.\n\n\"His comments are culturally uneducated and a blind attack with zero substance related to this project,\" O'Felan said. \"The reality of the ignorance falls within his statement suggesting his personal view on being 'Latino,' because a land mass or living area does not determine a person's blood history or genetics.\"\n\nLeguizamo wrote an open letter to the industry in the Los Angeles Times in November addressing the lack of visibility for Latinos in film despite the fact that they make up 19% of the US population.\n\n\"We need a better pipeline for Latinos in movies, TV shows, and plays,\" Leguizamo wrote. \"We need a system for our stories and our projects. We need executives to provide the greenlight.\"\n\nIn the letter, he also wrote about white actors playing Latino roles and putting on brownface to do so. He added that there aren't enough Latino \"executives, or development heads or directors or writers\" in the industry, making it difficult to get projects centered on \"Latin heroes and Latin success stories\" greenlit.\n\nIn December, Leguizamo told Insider while promoting his gory Christmas flick \"Violent Night\" that there was an incident in which a director told him that he already had a Latin person in the movie, and couldn't cast him.\n\n\"He said, 'I love your work, I want you in the movie,'\" Leguizamo told Insider. \"And then I hear back from him, he calls me up and he says, 'Oh, sorry man, you can't be in my movie because I already have a Latin actress and I can't have two Latin people in the movie.'\"\n\nLeguizamo said the incident was indicative of an \"unspoken 'Latin quota'\" in films. In other instances, he told Insider that he would be cast in films that would whitewash other Latin roles, making him the \"only Latin guy representing.\"\n\nLeguizamo said that while Pacino was \"his hero\" and  \"brilliant\" actor, it was a bizarre experience doing \"Carlito's Way\" with him.\n\n\"It's an odd experience to be a Latin man in a Latin story written by a Latin man and the lead guy's a white guy pretending to be Puerto Rican,\" Leguizamo said. \"I'm not going to lie, it's surreal. It was surreal. I turned the part down a few times and then eventually I decided to do it.\"\n\nDuring a guest-hosting stint on \"The Daily Show\" in March , Leguizamo spoke again about white actors being cast in Latino roles . This time, he gave an ultimatum - if it kept happening, he was going to do the same with white roles, starting with playing Gwyneth Paltrow in a hypothetical film about her ski accident trial.\n\n\"If white people can take our roles, I'm going to take theirs,\" he said. \"When they do the TV series based on Gwyneth Paltrow's ski-accident trial, I'm going to be Gwyneth Paltrow.\"\n\nAs reported by Today, Leguizamo appeared on the Spanish-language morning program Hoy Día to promote his new docuseries, \"Leguizamo Does America,\" about Latin contributions to American culture and civil rights issues.\n\nDuring the March 14 interview, he argued that in order to get more Latin stories on big and small screens, his peers need to \"complain\" as he does.\n\n\"We have to protest, we have to make noise so that they hear that we are not happy with the representation,\" he continued, noting that he's not afraid of potential consequences.\n\n\"I grew up in this country, I suffered a lot, I fought a lot, and all my life my opportunities were a thousand. And I knew at that moment that even if I was super smart and super talented, I would never have the same opportunities,\" he explained.\n\nLeguizamo starred in the 1993 live-action \"Super Mario Bros.\" movie as Luigi, along with Bob Hoskins as Mario. He's been outspoken about the lack of similar representation in the cast of the new animated film , which premiered on April 5.\n\n\"No, I will not be watching,\" Leguizamo told TMZ on April 6. \"They could've included a Latin character. I was groundbreaking and they stopped the groundbreaking.\"\n\n\"They messed up,\" he continued. \"They messed up the inclusion, they disincluded.\"\n\nJump to"

The \"John Wick\" star went on to call the lack of Latin inclusion in front of and behind the camera \"cultural apartheid.\"\n\nHe said that Latin artists succeed in all sections of the entertainment industry when measurable statistics are considered, citing musicians like J Balvin, Cardi B, Maluma, and Bad Bunny as examples of people whose success can't be denied because of numbers.\n\nLeguizamo claimed that when it comes to TV and movie projects, where \"an executive's opinion\" and \"taste\" matters in order for a story to get told, \"we're done.\"\n\n\"They don't see us, they don't know us, they don't care about us,\" he continued.\n\n\"The wall isn't on the border, the wall is in American culture,\" Leguizamo said in the 2020 docuseries .\n\nThe \"Encanto\" star , who was born in Colombia and raised in Queens, New York, said that he felt \"betrayed\" that his American education didn't teach him about all of the Latin heroes who are a part of US history.

Harry Reid adviser Jorge Silva and former Democratic National Convention Committee and Media Matters staffer Jess Torres.\n\nFounded in 2014 by actress Eva Longoria and Democratic National Committee treasurer Henry Muñoz III, the group recently refocused as a progressive organization after initially casting itself as more middle-of-the-road, occasionally backing Republican candidates.\n\nBut following the 2016 election, the group decided that the leaders of the Republican Party were openly hostile to policies that would benefit Latinos.\n\n\"Given the political climate and the policy priorities of our community, we've got to change. Because the Republican Party turned its back on us,\" Latino Victory Project President Cristóbal Alex told BuzzFeed News earlier this year.\n\n\"We can't negotiate with the white nationalists and racists that Trump has brought in.\"\n\nWhile the group always valued issues like immigration reform, it is focusing on backing candidates who take strong progressive stances on issues including healthcare, education, and raising the minimum wage.\n\nThough it is a fairly small organization, the candidates it backed in 2016 tended to win. As BuzzFeed notes, Latino Victory Project-backed candidates won nine of 11 primary campaigns, as well as nine of their 13 general election campaigns.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Read the pitch deck Suma Wealth, a Latino-focused fintech platform, used to raise $2.2 million to teach money management through culturally relevant content\n\nSuma Wealth, a 3-year-old fintech company that combines culturally relevant content and experiences with financial tools to help Latinos build wealth, raised $2.2 million in new funding.\n\nLeading the round was Radicle Impact, which was joined by Vamos Ventures, OVO fund, and the American Heart Association Impact fund. They joined previous backers Ulu Ventures, Female Founders Fund, and Chingona Ventures. The new round brings Suma's total funding to $5.5 million.\n\nSuma plans to use the new funding to hire in engineering, product, and sales. It also plans to invest in AI and other technology and data and analytics.\n\nSuma's proposition is that young Latinos have huge purchasing power and often are responsible for managing their families' finances . At the same time, there's a need for financial literacy. More than 9% of Hispanic households in the US were unbanked, meaning no one in the household had a checking or savings account, compared to 2.1% of white households, according to a 2021 FDIC survey .\n\n\"Our goal is to extend our reach beyond this achievement and continue our mission of closing the wealth gap within our Latino community,\" said Beatriz Acevedo, CEO and cofounder of Suma.\n\nSuma's approach includes a lot of colorful, food-themed video and gaming content that's useful (and funny). One video instructs viewers to \"Pay your bills on time (just like you eat your mamá's homemade empanadas while they're hot),\" for example.\n\n\"To stand out from the general market with our demo, we need to make sure we connect with them at an emotional level,\" Acevedo said. \"This is particularly important since for generations they've felt distrust in financial institutions.\"\n\nSuma also works with big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo to reach Latino customers and offers education programs for individuals and small-business owners.\n\nAcevedo was a radio and television host who cofounded the Latino-focused media brand Mitú in 2012. It sold in 2020. She got the idea for Suma during the pandemic when she saw its disproportionate impact on Latinos, Acevedo told TechCrunch.\n\nAlong with closing the seed round, Suma announced that it had passed 1 million users on its platforms and acquired Intellecto, a platform designed to personalize users' learning experiences.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck that Suma used to raise its most recent funding.\n\nSuma touts its coverage in outlets including The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch.\n\nSuma says big banks don't know how to cater to Latinos culturally and don't have their trust.\n\nIt uses food imagery to make an emotional connection to its users.\n\nSuma says 80% of its users are Gen Z and millennial, 65% are female, and 70% are Latino.\n\nSuma says its approach has led to increased savings by its users.\n\nSuma says it imparts financial literacy by speaking to users' core values.\n\nSuma says 70% of its users have increased their savings and more than half now have three months of emergency savings.\n\nIt's worked with Fidelity, Wells Fargo, Verizon, and more.\n\nFinancial coaching, educational games, and in-culture content are part of its approach.\n\nSuma's revenue sources include a membership tier and lead generation.\n\nIt considers itself to be competing with MoneyLion, Rocket, and Cleo.\n\nThe platform describes young Latinos as the influencers in their families and communities.\n\nIts founders are Beatriz Acevedo, who cofounded Mitú; Mary Hernandez, a former Mitú exec; and Xavier Gutiérrez, an investor.\n\nThe new round was led by Radicle Impact and brings its total funding to $5.5 million.\n\nJump to"

      "website": "https://www.insider.com",
      "text": "Pete Buttigieg's race problem is an overblown media creation he can overcome - so long as he doesn't screw up his response to it\n\nAs Pete Buttigieg surges in Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest places in the country, it's hard to ignore that he's not a frontrunner in racially diverse Nevada and South Carolina, the third and fourth states, respectively, to hold nominating contests. Nationally, he polls at 2% with African Americans and Latinos.\n\nThese blocs share a number of the same policy interests, including healthcare, jobs, and the economy, but there are differences, too. Hispanics list immigration as one of their top issues, while African Americans are more likely to express concerns about the criminal-justice system. Both groups, however, worry about racial inequality - a problem that Buttigieg has struggled with over the years.\n\nSouth Bend's first black police chief sued the city for discrimination after Buttigieg demoted him in 2012 for his role in wiretaps which caught officers making racist remarks, according to a white city official fired during the ordeal. An urban-renewal project Buttigieg initiated saw the destruction of abandoned and vacant homes in mostly black and Latino neighborhoods.\n\nEven since this summer Buttigieg has found himself embroiled in controversies surrounding his record on race. He clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. There were allegations of inflated black support for his plan to combat systemic racism.\n\nSome of the criticism, Buttigieg's supporters have argued, is unfair. For instance, his detractors accused him of equating being a gay man to being black , a comparison he never directly made. His allies have also accused the media of focusing on the racial tensions in South Bend at the expense of his efforts to fight inequality . Even the idea that Buttigieg struggles to gain traction with voters of color, they say, is unfair: Most of the presidential candidates aren't earning more than single-digit support from African Americans and Latinos.\n\nIf Buttigieg has a \"race problem,\" it seems much of the Democratic field does, too.\n\nShifting the perception that he's disconnected from minority voters won't be easy. Activists, politicians, voters, and the mayor himself said he'll have to own his past missteps while challenging a popular narrative that positions the African-American and LGBTQ communities as adversaries. Along the way, he'll need to tout his efforts to promote equality and boost his name recognition with voters of color - a group Buttigieg admits doesn't yet know him well.\n\n\"Even now, we know that we're not as well known as some of my competitors,\" he said after being told he had taken the lead in some Iowa polls. \"So, it's very encouraging and, at the same time, there's a long way to go, and there are a lot of states in this process.\"\n\nWhen we spoke, the mayor wore his usual ensemble: white dress shirt, a blue tie and pants, and brown Oxfords. His fresh haircut and slight build gave him a youthful air. He appeared warmer in person than he does on television. Careful to make eye contact as he spoke, he adopted a humble tone when addressing rival Julián Castro's concern that the Democratic nominee should be someone who can win support from blacks and Latinos.\n\nDuring his westward swing, which took him to California and Nevada, Buttigieg spoke to audiences in Spanish. He talked about hate crimes, xenophobia, and what he calls a \"crisis of belonging.\" He told me that he is devoted to black and brown communities. \"It hasn't been perfect,\" he said of his campaign, \"and I recognize there is work to do.\" He added: \"It is most certainly true that to win, and to deserve to win, any candidate for the presidency needs to be speaking with black voters, needs to be speaking to Latino voters, needs to earn that support.\"\n\nTo help him do so, Buttigieg has diversified his campaign staff - it's now 40% people of color . He met with civil-rights activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton , Rep. John Lewis , and the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber , and won endorsements from minority politicians across the country .\n\n\"Can you say it to us today in front of all these cameras that black lives matter?\"\n\nOn June 21, five days after South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O'Neill killed Eric Logan, a 54-year-old black man, protesters demanded that the mayor respond to their question.\n\nA husband and father of seven, Logan died after O'Neill stopped him on suspicion of burglary in the parking lot of a South Bend apartment complex. The officer claimed he shot the suspect for wielding a knife, but his body camera had been off during the incident, angering activists and community members.\n\nOutcry over the killing prompted Buttigieg to leave the campaign trail and return to South Bend, where he briefly met with the Logan family. A crowd of protestors awaited him in front of police headquarters with signs stating: \"Who do you call when police murder\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nAs the demonstrators shrieked their complaints to him, Buttigieg appeared shocked, concerned, and frustrated.\n\n\"Did you just ask me if black lives matter?\" he asked the activists.\n\n\"Yes, we want to hear you say it!\" a woman screamed back.\n\n\"Of course, black lives matter,\" he said.\n\nSouth Bend is 26.4% African American and 14.4% Hispanic. Buttigieg has been a popular enough politician to win re-election there, but his relationship with the black community has, at times, been strained.\n\nA major rupture occurred in 2012, with the demotion of former Police Chief Darryl Boykins, the first and only African American to serve in the role. After Boykins's departure, the percentage of black officers on the police force dropped from 10% to 5% from 2014 to 2018. Buttigieg acknowledges the lack of diversity in the police force has been a failure of his tenure , admitting that he \" couldn't get it done .\"\n\nThe mayor has also struggled to close the city's racial-wealth gap , which is wider than the nation's generally, despite concerted efforts .\n\nThe aftermath of Eric Logan's killing endangered any gains Buttigieg made with South Bend's black community. In his encounter with the Black Lives Matter activists this summer, he told the crowd he \"did not have evidence\" that officers in the police department had been disciplined for racist behavior, which only heightened their anger.\n\nIn one widely reported exchange, a protester asked him how he expected African Americans to support his candidacy if he didn't take action on Logan's killing.\n\nAccording to a number of reports, Buttigieg told the woman he wasn't asking for her vote, a response that drew criticism. But his full response was more nuanced: \"I'm not asking for your vote. I will promise that there will be a review to make sure that there is no racism on this department and that it will be independent.\"\n\nButtigieg's remarks crystalized one of his campaign's biggest challenges: A desire to please all parties - an approach that often winds up leaving no one satisfied.\n\nSoon after he met with protestors, the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police slammed his handling of the incident, calling one of his statements after the shooting - \"All police work and all American life takes place in the shadow of racism\" - divisive.\n\nProgressives also criticized the mayor's response. As he stumbled through the crisis, he seemed to lack the innate ability \"to navigate ... a situation that calls for humanity and an open ear and awareness of systemic racism,\" Natalia Salgado, chief of civic engagement for the Center of Popular Democracy , said.\n\nThe confrontational posture the episode demanded doesn't come easy for a candidate inclined towards comity and unity building.\n\n\"In our community, we like people to tell the truth,\" Brandon Neal, a senior adviser to Buttigieg, told me. Neal, who is black, added: \"One of the things the mayor has been applauded on is the fact that he did tell the truth and said he made a mistake, and there are things, looking back on it, he could've done better. I think that's within itself a quality of a leader and a quality of a person that's trustworthy.\"\n\nIn November, Buttigieg stepped onto the ballroom stage of Las Vegas's Bellagio Hotel, the site of the Democratic Party's \"First in the West\" event. There, he told the diverse crowd that the US is facing \"a crisis of belonging\" and he's the antidote to \"divider-in-chief\" Donald Trump.\n\n\"Americans are told in so many ways, for so many reasons, that you don't belong, that you don't fit .... I want every American to know, regardless of where you come from or the language you speak at home, where your parents came from, you belong,\" Buttigieg said. \"No matter who you love or who you worship, you belong.\"\n\nAs a Christian, an immigrant's son, and a gay man, Buttigieg has said that his overlapping identities have always made him feel marginalized. Outsiders like him, he said, will be welcome in his United States.\n\nSome voters have speculated about whether Buttigieg can deliver on that message. Among them is Mujahid Ramadan , the former CEO of the nonprofit Nevada Partners in North Las Vegas, a historically black city roughly eight miles from the pomp of the Bellagio Hotel. In this community, residents share many problems with South Bend's low-income communities, such as a persistent racial wealth gap\n\n\"He'll be able to see the populations of color and how they're affected by systemic racism because he's affected by a similar 'ism,' as in homophobia,\" Ramadan said of Buttigieg. \"Now, is he going to be courageous enough to take that step and make that an inclusive part of his campaign?\"\n\nAlthough Buttigieg has not explicitly compared sexual orientation with race during his presidential run, he has been criticized for drawing a parallel between his journey as a gay man and the experiences of people of color.\n\n\"My commitment as somebody who has seen my own rights up for debate and benefitted from the advocacy of people not at all like me is to make sure I'm doing everything I can, given my background and frankly the privileges that I carry, for others,\" Buttigieg told me.\n\nWhen the mayor made nearly identical remarks during the Nov. 20 presidential debate, Sen. Kamala Harris - who has since dropped out of the race - suggested they were \"just not productive\" and \"a bit naive.\" Rev. Sharpton, who has not endorsed any candidate in the race, avoided taking sides on the matter, telling the Washington Post both that Harris \"had a point\" and that Buttigieg had been misunderstood.\n\n\"It's always tricky to compare marginalizations ... because when things are different there's an assumption that one must be bigger, greater, or more important than another,\" Ron Buckmire , a black former-LGBTQ activist and an associate dean at Occidental College, told me. \"But that reasoning leads you straight to the 'Oppression Olympics' where no one is the winner. I do think that a gay white man is more likely to be able to empathize with a black man or Latinx woman than a straight white man can.\"\n\nMedia coverage of homophobia among black Americans previously grew out of misleading data following California's Proposition 8 , a 2008 ballot measure to eliminate same-sex marriage. A similar narrative surrounding Buttigieg's sexuality and his struggles with black voters has popped up, but some voters are tired of the idea.\n\nRenee Gray, a 56-year-old black Army veteran, said she found the coverage of Buttigieg's struggles with African-American supporters exasperating.\n\n\"They're trying to say black people or minority people don't care for gays, and I know for a fact that's not true. I don't believe that.\"\n\nThe subject of black homophobia has made headlines during Buttigieg's presidential bid, in part, because his campaign hired a consulting firm to conduct focus groups with black voters in South Carolina. Some participants questioned how a young man with no Washington experience could take on the Republicans, while others expressed discomfort with the candidate's same-sex marriage . When the findings about the focus groups made their way into the news media - thanks, reportedly, to a leak from operatives for the Buttigieg campaign - a spate of stories about black homophobia followed.\n\n\"I can't imagine any reason why our team would have leaked that, and I stand by the fact that the assertation is just really insulting,\" Lauren Brown, the candidate's South Carolina spokesperson, told me. \"It's unfortunate because I think there's a lot of voters in the state that believe in the inclusivity that we're promoting on this campaign.\"\n\nAt the Nov. 17 \" Democratic Presidential Forum on Latino Issues \" at California State University, Los Angeles, Buttigieg was joined by Sanders, Harris, Castro, and billionaire Tom Steyer. The presidential hopefuls fielded questions from local reporters about Latino voters, who are expected to make up the nation's largest nonwhite voting bloc in 2020.\n\nWhen Buttigieg took the stage, he received tepid applause. In his first question to the mayor, KABC-TV news anchor Marc Brown made it plain: His frontrunner status meant little to Golden Staters.\n\n\"Iowa is not California, [it is] demographically very different from California, arguably very different from much of the Democratic Party,\" Brown said. \"What are you gonna do to connect with Latino voters here in California?\"\n\nButtigieg began his response by saying that he has connected with some Latino voters already and looked forward to connecting with more, particularly in California.\n\n\"Latino voters that I speak to are extremely concerned about healthcare, about the direction of our economy, about immigration policy,\" he said, \"and about something that's deeper than any individual policy, the way people are being treated, singled out, and told they do not belong in this country.\"\n\nBefore he can bond with California's Hispanic electorate, the mayor will have to make his existence known to many of them. A November Latino Decisions poll found that 49% of likely Hispanic voters in the Golden State have never heard of Buttigieg or have no opinion of him. Only 16% of those surveyed said the same for Biden and Sanders, while 34% said they didn't know enough about Warren.\n\nBut the poll also revealed that protecting immigrant rights is a top concern of the state's Hispanic electorate - meaning that Buttigieg's advocacy for undocumented immigrants could give him some cache with Latinos unfamiliar with him.\n\nIn 2016, Buttigieg collaborated with a South Bend nonprofit to develop a \"Community Resident Card,\" a sort of municipal ID for undocumented immigrants to use at city agencies and businesses, including schools, libraries, pharmacies, and banks. Of South Bend's roughly 4,500 undocumented immigrants, more than 2,000 have reportedly signed up for the card. \"[T]hat was one example where we knew we could make a difference and didn't want to hesitate to act,\" Buttigieg told me.\n\nAlthough immigration policy disproportionately affects Latinos, too often politicians focus solely on that issue, Danny Turkel, a spokesman for the advocacy group Voto Latino , told me.\n\n\"Politicians will say, 'I support a pathway to citizenship,' and that's all they have to say to Latino voters,\" Turkel said. \"It's a really lazy way of checking the box off. Immigration matters to Latinos, but so many issues matter that are not being addressed.\"\n\nMariela Hernandez, the Latino advocate for the Nevada State Democratic Party, had a slightly different take. \"One of the reasons we focus on immigration more than any other issue is because immigration issues do drive Latino voters to the polls. It's a combination of immigration, plus the economy and healthcare.\"\n\nUnder Trump, Hispanic engagement in the election process has risen - perhaps an unsurprising outcome for a president who famously kicked off his campaign by describing some immigrants from Mexico as \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\"\n\nAt Cal State L.A. forum, a moderator asked Buttigieg to discuss Trump's characterization of DACA recipients as \" far from angels .\" (DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , a program started by the federal government in 2012 to offer some undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children permission to work, thereby delaying deportation.)\n\nIn response, Buttigieg shook his head and sighed.\n\n\"Where do you begin? This is a president who is looking at human beings and not seeing human beings. Last time I checked, the president's not an angel either,\" he quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.\n\n\"He has an understanding about our population, so I think that's really important,\" Cal State L.A. senior Mayra Zamora said after the forum.\n\nPrior to the event, Zamora knew little about Buttigieg. But he made a strong impression, particularly when describing the fear Latinos feel in the current political climate.\n\n\"The other candidates, they say they understand us, but I think Pete Buttigieg can speak from personal experience, so he can relate to us more,\" Zamora added.\n\nWhen Buttigieg has tried to meet the urgency of the moment, his efforts seem to backfire. Consider the Douglass Plan debacle.\n\nThrough the plan, which includes strategies to improve health, education, voting rights, and entrepreneurship in communities of color, the Buttigieg campaign hoped to demonstrate his commitment to racial minorities.\n\nBut soon after its roll out, The Intercept reported that two of the three black South Carolina politicians Buttigieg's campaign listed as supporters hadn't actually endorsed the plan. The Intercept also reported that a press release the campaign sent out alongside an open letter featured in HBCU Times implied the plan's 400 endorsees were black. (It listed only African-American names as featured endorsees.)\n\nThe story also said that an email from the campaign implied that the politicians listed as endorsees also backed Buttigieg's presidential bid. On top of all that, The Intercept reported that some of the people named as supporters may reside out of state or couldn't be found.\n\nThe ordeal drew national attention and further fueled the notion that Buttigieg's supposed \"race problem\" would render him unelectable should he become the Democratic nominee.\n\nButtigieg's South Carolina staffers Jarvis Houston and Lauren Brown, who are both black, insisted that the campaign never stated publicly that all the South Carolinians backing the policy were African American. \"We have been very clear that not every supporter of the plan is African American, and we never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan,\" Houston said.\n\nJohnnie Cordero, chair of the Democratic Black Caucus of South Carolina and one of the politicians who did not endorse the plan, said the question of whether all 400 people that endorsed it were actually black amounted to \"nitpicking.\" But he did find it problematic if the campaign implied that they were all black.\n\nCordero said he didn't endorse the plan for a number of reasons, including that he couldn't be sure who actually wrote it. According to Houston, multiple people authored the plan, including two black advisors: Portia Allen-Kyle, advocacy and policy counsel for the ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice, and Chike Aguh of the McCrystal Group.\n\nWhile Cordero said that the controversies around the plan aren't \"as damaging as one would think,\" he also stressed that the candidate is the leader of the campaign.  \"[Buttigieg] is the captain of the ship ... The ship goes down, the captain is responsible.\"\n\nAlthough the racial wealth gap in South Bend remains higher than it is nationally, the poverty rate has dropped from 32% in 2011, when Buttigieg was elected mayor, to 20% in 2017, the most recent year statistics are available.\n\nIn 2018, the city of South Bend teamed up with the South Bend Heritage Foundation to launch the West Side Small Business Resource Center, a community center designed to help new entrepreneurs of color by connecting them with business experts and networking opportunities. The resource center opened last year in a largely African-American neighborhood. James Summers, a business consultant involved in the effort, has described it as a \"truly grassroots and community-focused approach to generating new wealth through small business.\" When the facility opened its doors, Buttigieg said he got involved to narrow the city's racial wealth gap.\n\nElizabeth Bennion, a political scientist at Indiana University, has cautioned against holding a single politician responsible for the economic changes in South Bend (or any city) since state and national trends have a large influence.\n\nBut Bennion said that mayors can work with city councils to set wage and benefits standards for companies seeking tax abatements and other incentives. They can attract and retain businesses, support efforts to raise local wages, or increase pay for city workers. Buttigieg did all that.\n\n\"Mayors can make the problems of poverty and economic inequality better or worse based on the policies and opportunities they create and support at a local level,\" she said, adding that it could take a full term or longer for a mayor's efforts to come to fruition.\n\nButtigieg told me that one way he plans to win over voters in majority-minority states like Nevada is by emphasizing his desire to improve their economic circumstances through policies like raising the federal minimum wage.\n\n\"I think the important thing is to make sure that we're connecting with voters, whether they are with policy answers to knowing how much of a difference it disproportionately makes to women of color to raise the wage,\" Buttigieg said. He also discussed helping entrepreneurs who are women of color, pointing out that they are the ones often \"creating economic opportunities for others, but who face a lot of barriers when it comes to access to credit and the ability to grow their business.\"\n\nTameika Devine, a Columbia, South Carolina, councilwoman, endorsed the Douglass Plan because of its emphasis on closing the racial wealth gap. She told me she's tried to educate other city leaders about how historic forms of discrimination like redlining and Jim Crow still drive the racial wealth gap.\n\n\"One of the big things about the Douglass Plan to me is Mayor Pete addresses that history upfront and how a lot of our country's policies allow the wealth gap to continue to grow along racial and ethnic lines,\" she said. Devine, who had expressed concerns to The Intercept that her endorsement of the plan was perceived as an endorsement of the mayor, said she believes Buttigieg can recover from the Douglass Plan episode.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 18 Quinnipiac poll, 60% of likely black voters in South Carolina aren't familiar enough with Buttigieg to have an opinion of him. Only 12% and 11% of these voters, respectively, said the same about Sanders and Biden.\n\nOf course, even if voters get to know Buttigieg, there's no guarantee they'll back him over an established candidate like Biden. African Americans heavily back the former vice president, and Latino voters identify him as the candidate they believe can beat Trump.\n\nWhile some people of color appreciate Biden's experience or his ties to the Obama administration, others view him as a safe choice in a perilous time. His missteps on race - his central role in authoring the 1994 crime bill , his handling of Anita Hill's testimony against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, his numerous racially insensitive gaffes , the recent departure of his top Latina adviser - may have no bearing on these voters.\n\n\"We should never underestimate the power of name recognition,\" Salgado said. \"Biden is riding the coattails of an esteemed president. There's also anxiety and fear permeating our communities. People are scared about whether they're going to be deported or going to be safe in church.\"\n\nBuckmire paraphrased an anecdote from a Jonathan Capehart column , in which he recounted something an aunt told him: \"The way the system is set up now, there is so much racism that it's going to have to be an old white person to go after an old white person.\"\n\nThis, of course, is not what Buttigieg, who is vying to be the youngest US president in history, would say.\n\nAt the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, he touted his military experience, politics of inclusion, and down-to-earth lifestyle as reasons why he's a viable alternative to Trump. He assured the crowd that, though the president and his allies will do all they can to maintain power, their playbook won't work on him.\n\nButtigieg went on to ask the audience to imagine the first day the sun comes up without Trump as president. He knows how high the stakes are for the 2020 election, he stressed.\n\n\"So much depends on getting this right,\" he said, \"because if there are four more years of this president, we will not recognize our United States of America.\"\n\nThe mayor then punctuated his next three words: \"We. Must. Win.\"\n\nNadra Nittle is a writer living in California.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Read the pitch deck Suma Wealth, a Latino-focused fintech platform, used to raise $2.2 million to teach money management through culturally relevant content\n\nSuma Wealth, a 3-year-old fintech company that combines culturally relevant content and experiences with financial tools to help Latinos build wealth, raised $2.2 million in new funding.\n\nLeading the round was Radicle Impact, which was joined by Vamos Ventures, OVO fund, and the American Heart Association Impact fund. They joined previous backers Ulu Ventures, Female Founders Fund, and Chingona Ventures. The new round brings Suma's total funding to $5.5 million.\n\nSuma plans to use the new funding to hire in engineering, product, and sales. It also plans to invest in AI and other technology and data and analytics.\n\nSuma's proposition is that young Latinos have huge purchasing power and often are responsible for managing their families' finances . At the same time, there's a need for financial literacy. More than 9% of Hispanic households in the US were unbanked, meaning no one in the household had a checking or savings account, compared to 2.1% of white households, according to a 2021 FDIC survey .\n\n\"Our goal is to extend our reach beyond this achievement and continue our mission of closing the wealth gap within our Latino community,\" said Beatriz Acevedo, CEO and cofounder of Suma.\n\nSuma's approach includes a lot of colorful, food-themed video and gaming content that's useful (and funny). One video instructs viewers to \"Pay your bills on time (just like you eat your mamá's homemade empanadas while they're hot),\" for example.\n\n\"To stand out from the general market with our demo, we need to make sure we connect with them at an emotional level,\" Acevedo said. \"This is particularly important since for generations they've felt distrust in financial institutions.\"\n\nSuma also works with big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo to reach Latino customers and offers education programs for individuals and small-business owners.\n\nAcevedo was a radio and television host who cofounded the Latino-focused media brand Mitú in 2012. It sold in 2020. She got the idea for Suma during the pandemic when she saw its disproportionate impact on Latinos, Acevedo told TechCrunch.\n\nAlong with closing the seed round, Suma announced that it had passed 1 million users on its platforms and acquired Intellecto, a platform designed to personalize users' learning experiences.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck that Suma used to raise its most recent funding.\n\nSuma touts its coverage in outlets including The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch.\n\nSuma says big banks don't know how to cater to Latinos culturally and don't have their trust.\n\nIt uses food imagery to make an emotional connection to its users.\n\nSuma says 80% of its users are Gen Z and millennial, 65% are female, and 70% are Latino.\n\nSuma says its approach has led to increased savings by its users.\n\nSuma says it imparts financial literacy by speaking to users' core values.\n\nSuma says 70% of its users have increased their savings and more than half now have three months of emergency savings.\n\nIt's worked with Fidelity, Wells Fargo, Verizon, and more.\n\nFinancial coaching, educational games, and in-culture content are part of its approach.\n\nSuma's revenue sources include a membership tier and lead generation.\n\nIt considers itself to be competing with MoneyLion, Rocket, and Cleo.\n\nThe platform describes young Latinos as the influencers in their families and communities.\n\nIts founders are Beatriz Acevedo, who cofounded Mitú; Mary Hernandez, a former Mitú exec; and Xavier Gutiérrez, an investor.\n\nThe new round was led by Radicle Impact and brings its total funding to $5.5 million.\n\nJump to"

So they were doing that for my safety and to protect me. But even so, these conversations have shown me that I'm still proud of being Hispanic, even though it's being frowned upon by other people.\"\n\nOne million Hispanic-Americans will turn 18 this year and every year for at least the next two decades, said Mark Hugo López, director of global migration and demography research at the Pew Research Center. That stream of adolescent Latinos coming of age in the U.S. started a few years ago and is now gushing.\n\n\"This won't be a passing wave,\" Lopez said, \"but instead an ongoing process over the next 20 years as the young Latino population enters adulthood.\"\n\nAlthough percentage-wise Asian Americans are the nation's fastest-growing minority group, the Latino population will add more people each year to the U.S. than any other group for the next few decades, and their median age is younger than Asian Americans, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nMost of these young Latinos have one thing in common - they were born in the United States.\n\nNine out of ten Latinos under 18 are U.S. born.\n\nFor those under 35, it's about eight in ten, according to new figures from Pew Research Center .\n\nOver half of Latinos under 18 and roughly two-thirds of Latino millennials are second-generation Americans - born in the U.S. to least one immigrant parent.\n\n\"These young Latinos are U.S. born, going through U.S. schools,\" Lopez said, \"yet they grew up in Latino households, exposed to the culture of their parents' home country - that is the distinguishing point. They have all the markers of being American, yet they are the children of immigrants.\"\n\nNavigating their parents' immigrant culture while being born and raised in the U.S. has shaped their views on identity and what it means to be an American - factors that are, in turn, shaping the nation's adult workforce and electorate.\n\nLike other population waves throughout the country's history, these young bicultural Americans are coming of age enmeshed in their Latino and American worlds and trying to carve out a place for themselves in both of them and between.\n\nBerenize García, 16, of New York City, said her father, a Mexican immigrant, has pressured her to be \"more American,\" while her mother told her it's disrespectful not to retain and speak Spanish to their Mexican relatives.\n\n\"That makes me feel confused, because how can I be Mexican when I'm pressured to be more American? How can I be American when I'm pressured to be more Mexican?\" she said.\n\nHer confusion is captured in a scene from the 1997 movie \"Selena,\" in which actor Edward James Olmos, playing a father, tells his children how difficult it is to be Mexican-American and the nonacceptance that comes from both Mexico and the United States: \"We have to be twice as perfect as everybody else.\"\n\nThese experiences with language and culture have imprinted themselves on García and have affected how she sees her future.\n\n\"I'm trying to, hopefully, one day become a doctor, and in that way empower my patients who have that language barrier, because my mom, who goes to the doctor constantly, can't really express her pain because she doesn't speak English,\" García said. \"Her pain is brushed off.\"\n\nWhile this younger generation of Latinos is more conversant in English than their immigrant parents' generation, three-in-four young Hispanics say they use Spanish as well, according to Pew.\n\nToggling between two languages - and that it's hard to be truly bilingual - is perhaps one of the most common threads growing up for these young Latinos.\n\n\"We're stripped in a lot of cases of our Spanish tongue and our Spanish heritage and told it's really important that you only speak English and you know how to speak English well because otherwise, you're going to face hardship, which is in a lot of ways true because of the prejudice that this country holds,\" said Alma Flores-Perez, 21, born and raised in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"But at the same time, I've really come to see the importance of speaking Spanish or at least trying to claim that as our own and not be ashamed when you do speak Spanish, but also not being ashamed if you weren't taught it, because that wasn't necessarily your choice,\" Flores-Perez said. She thinks her bicultural upbringing is one of the reasons she's majoring in linguistics at Stanford.\n\nEven more of an impact than language, for many young Latinos, is how their skin color influences how they're perceived, not only by other Americans but by other Hispanic Americans.\n\nFlores-Perez, who is light-skinned, has been questioned when she identifies herself as Chicana.\n\n\"I've been called whitewashed,\" said Flores-Perez, who said it hurt to not be considered Latina enough because of her light complexion. But she's come to understand it's not something she can control.\n\n\"I think I can do my best to project that identity and to make clear who I am and explain when people ask,\" she said.\n\nChristopher Robert, 18, of Brooklyn, whose mother is Dominican and father is Puerto Rican, said, \"There are a lot of people in my family who have a dark skin tone, but still, like, insist that they're part of a white Latino population.\"\n\nRobert, who describes himself as Afro-Latino, added, \"I choose to acknowledge it and accept it as part of who I am.\"\n\nLeyanis Díaz, 25, is an Afro-Latina blogger and entrepreneur based in Miami who was born in Cuba and came to the United States with her family when she was 3.\n\n\"I had people tell me they didn't even know that there were black people in Cuba, which made me really feel ...,\" she said pausing. \"It gave me self-esteem issues, for the most part.\"\n\nThat didn't stop her from entering, and winning, the Miss Black Florida USA pageant last year. \"In all honesty, the way I've combated these stereotypes is by continuing to educate not only my friends, but the people that I encounter -educating them about Cuba, where I come from, teaching them more about my culture,\" Díaz said.\n\nMany young Latinos see themselves as in-between skin colors and races.\n\nJeanette Garzón Terreros, 18, a freshman at Columbia, said that when she's filled out certain forms, she has left blank the questions on race or ethnicity.\n\n\"I don't identify as white, I don't identify as black, I don't identify as any of the things, and they don't put an 'other,'\" she said. Garzón Terreros said she saw a picture of the part of Mexico that her parents are from, and the people looked part indigenous, part Spanish. \"It's like the mix between the two races.\"\n\nBeyond issues of language and color, living amid their immigrant parents and their extended network has influenced how young Latinos see issues in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nSome recounted, amid smiles, growing up as Latinos while not necessarily embracing their families' traditions. \"I don't dance; salsa, nothing,\" said Christopher Robert. \"I don't know how to cook Dominican food or anything.\"\n\nMore seriously, they spoke of the pressure their parents felt to help relatives in their home countries, despite not having much more money themselves.\n\nThey also spoke of having to explain their identity not just in their U.S. neighborhoods, but in their parents' home countries, to family members who questioned their accents or status based on their U.S. experience.\n\nHere at home, U.S.-born young Latinos also grow up with the reality that depending on their family or friends' immigration status, they could one day be taken by immigration enforcement officers, held in detention for long periods and possibly deported.\n\nWith community if not familial ties to immigrants - including legal residents without documents and people with deportation deferrals - detentions and deportations or the fear of them are part of young Latinos' daily lives.\n\nFlores-Perez said she was \"really rocked\" when President Donald Trump brought up trying to rescind the DACA program, Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, which allowed undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country.\n\nHer best friend, from Honduras, was a DACA student. \"I was terrified, and she was terrified because she's been here since she was 2 years old. This country is all she knows,\" said Flores-Perez.\n\nA survey of millennials released in January found that 49 percent of millennial Latinos worried a lot that a family member or close friend could be deported, compared to 25 percent of Asian Americans and 21 percent of African-Americans. White millennials' experience was the polar opposite to Latinos: Fifty percent said they did not know anyone at risk of being deported.\n\nYoung adults under 35 are already the most diverse generation in U.S. history, according to Stella Rouse , a University of Maryland political scientist. The diversity has found its way into politics and policy making and is likely to give a distinct shape to how the country addresses major issues.\n\nIn her new book, \"The Politics of Millennials\" - written with Ashley D. Ross, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University - Rouse argues that millennials' diversity, combined with growing up amid the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Great Recession and the debate over immigration, \"simply guides a lot of attitudes and policy preferences.\" This includes their views on the economy, the role of government in providing opportunities and how to deal with a lack of access to health insurance.\n\nRouse sees the influence of diversity and upbringing in young Latinos' attitudes toward climate change, for example.\n\nThe share of Latino millennials who believe climate change is occurring is about 49 percentage points higher than white millennials and 20 percentage points higher than African-Americans.\n\nYoung Latinos may be disproportionately affected by climate change considering where they live, how many of them or their families are employed in the agricultural industry and that they have relatives in other countries that have experienced climate-related issues, Rouse said.\n\nAs with every generation, a young person's trajectory is eventually tied not only to their prosperity but to the country's economic success. When looking at the nation's Latino youth, there are challenges and there are opportunities, according to Pew Research's López.\n\nOn the one hand, a record number of young Latinos, 3.6 million in 2016, are attending college, and their share is growing, according to Pew. Additionally, 67 percent of Latinos ages 25 and older had earned a high school degree.\n\nYet they lag behind other groups in pursing higher education. Just 17.2 percent of Hispanic adults have a bachelor's degree and 5 percent an advanced degree, compared to 38.1 percent and 14.3 percent of non-Hispanic whites, according to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is college costs, complicated by the fact that Latino families, which generally started the Great Recession with less net worth than other ethnic groups, lost 66 percent of their household wealth during this period.\n\n\"I'm at Northeastern right now - I'm only here because there was a good financial aid package, and even so it was extremely expensive,\" said Robert, the Brooklyn teen . \"Before I made my decision, I sat down with my mom and asked her, 'Are you sure you want to do this?'\"\n\nDespite financial odds, young Latinos are profoundly optimistic. More than three-in-four Hispanics ages 18-35 say most people who want to get ahead will be able to make it if they work hard.\n\nMarco Garcia is Berenize's twin brother. He described their immigrant parents' hard work. \"My dad works six days a week from 10 to 10,\" Marco said. \"My mom works as a housemaid, scrubbing floors, cleaning bathrooms and what not.\"\n\nWhen they were younger, Marco was embarrassed by his parents' broken English when they came to school functions. Now he and his sister, students at Uncommon Charter High School in Brooklyn, see it as a point of pride that they're children of immigrants - as well as high achieving students.\n\n\"I feel very optimistic about the future,\" Berenize said. \"Our parents already did the majority of the work. All we've got to do is just finish it.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK , TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM .\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In a year of political polarization fueled by a presidential election, we're marking Hispanic Heritage Month by focusing on 10 Americans who have received major recognition or seen their work and influence grow in 2024. While they do vastly different work, they all have one thing in common: Their Latino heritage proudly informs their expertise and their outlook - as well as their commitment to making things better.\n\nWhen so many people are talking about a specific TV episode starring one particular character , you know the actor's done something right. That actor is Liza Colón-Zayas, who has drawn critical acclaim and quickly become a fan-favorite for her role as Bettina \"Tina\" Marrero on the hit FX series \"The Bear.\" (Update: After publication, Colón-Zayas made history by becoming the first Latina to win an Emmy win for supporting actress in a comedy series .) Her performance also garnered a 2024 Imagen Award for best supporting actress in the television comedy category. The Bronx-born actor of Puerto Rican heritage - a proud \"Nuyorican\" - has worked for decades in TV and won awards for her work in the theater. But Colón-Zayas nabbed major attention this year when \"The Bear\" focused an episode on her sous-chef character's heartbreaking and inspirational origin story, which also starred her real-life husband , David Zayas , as her other half in a loving, hardworking Latino couple. In a recent NBC News interview, Colón-Zayas gave some words of advice for those still working for their big break. \"Be prepared. Show up on time. Know what you have to do. If it goes your way, it goes your way, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. Be yourself. Don't try to imitate anybody else.\"\n\nThere's a reason why Luis A. Colón received the 2024 Lifetime Mentor Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS): More than one-third of faculty members hired in chemistry departments in recent years who come from underrepresented groups have a connection to Colón or a program inspired by him, a colleague told the AAAS. Originally from Puerto Rico and the first in his family to go to college, the University at Buffalo chemistry professor has spent decades recruiting and encouraging students from his native island and other places to pursue advanced science degrees, recommending them for jobs and fellowships and paying their way to conferences when financial resources were scarce. As a result, his students have gone on to jobs in research and academia, corporations and in the pharmaceutical industry. \"If I was somehow able to contribute a little crystal of sand as they went along their way, I'm very happy about that,\" he told NBC News. \"I am actually proud that. Out of all my students, I still maintain some relationship or connection with at least 90% of them, even if it's only a Christmas card or a phone call.\"\n\nAs \"Saturday Night Live's\" first Gen Z cast member, Marcello Hernández has become a breakout star in his short time on the show , including his role as a young man trying to shield his date from his overly protective Latina mom - and tía. In July, Variety magazine named him as one of its 2024 Power of Young Hollywood honorees. The comedian, writer and actor of Cuban and Dominican descent was an instant hit on the show, going viral with his first on-air \"Weekend Update\" segment in which he discussed Latino baseball players, and he's since been called the series' \"new secret weapon.\"\n\nWhen Hernández first moved to New York City, he started out as a \"barker\" in the East Village, trying to cajole passersby into buying tickets to comedy shows as he dreamed of doing stand-up. On NBC's \"TODAY\" show , Hernández described his experience on \"SNL\" as \"insane,\" saying \"every day you ... can't believe you're there.\" Hernández draws upon his experiences as the son of immigrants for much of his stand-up, and he credits his mother for always supporting his dream. Growing up, he told the \"TODAY\" anchors, \"me and my mom were always together.\"\n\nKenny Luna grew up hanging and working the shelves at his Dominican dad's New York City supermarkets, also influenced by his Peruvian mom and his family's visits to the Dominican Republic's \"campo,\" or countryside, where his father came from. When both he and his college buddy Scott Hattis started young families of their own - Hattis' wife is Dominican - they decided to combine their desire for healthier, fresher food products without artificial ingredients or fillers with Latin pantry staples used to make traditional Caribbean and Hispanic dishes. The result was Loisa, named for New York City's iconic \"Loisaida\" (Lower East Side) neighborhood, with its rich Puerto Rican history. In 2017, they started selling online their organic, all-natural \"adobo\" and \"sazón\" seasonings, later pairing up with chef and educator Yadi Garcia to offer \"sofrito\" and \"recaíto\" cooking sauces used in Spanish Caribbean cooking. Their online fan base grew and they started expanding. \"What I'm most proud of Loisa's success,\" Luna told NBC News, \"is seeing the brand grow and be sold in larger retail stores,\" including the Wegmans supermarket chain beginning in 2023 and also now nationwide this year at Whole Foods and Sprouts. \"With young Latinos in the U.S.,\" said Luna, \"we're seeing a lot of excitement with Loisa being in grocery store shelves.\"\n\nThe young Mexican American owner of a taquería in the small border town of Mission, Texas, Ana Liz Pulido took home the equivalent of a food \"Oscar\" when she won the James Beard Award for best chef in Texas. Since she opened Ana Liz Taqueria in 2021, she's gotten rave reviews for her restaurant, where everything is made from scratch - even the organic corn masa for her tortillas. The native Texan's business is a family affair, with her father grilling meat every day and her mother making flour tortillas. \"My father, who had experience in the food industry, told me at first to do something else. ... He said it's too hard, it's too much work, too many hours,\" Pulido told NBC News. \"But eventually he came around and has been super supportive.\" Until recently, her small establishment had only five tables , but after her award, her food was in such high demand that the restaurant had to briefly shut down all takeout service. Since then, Pulido has expanded her dining area and her kitchen, she told NBC News. Some fans are urging her to expand her business into other locations in Texas, but for now she is content with her place in Mission. \"We want to keep working and improving here,\" Pulido said, \"and to make the best food for our customers.\"\n\nAs the top doctor overseeing the health of the nation's most populous state, California's surgeon general is harnessing her decades of experience in public health - and as a practicing OB-GYN. \"The week that I was sworn in was the week that I delivered my last baby,\" she told NBC News. Now as surgeon general, Ramos is spearheading a $4 billion initiative to bolster youth mental health and strengthening reproductive health care access and maternal health. \"I see myself as a bridge, a connector between all parties, and a voice that can share some of the experiences that people are living,\" Ramos said. This year, she was recognized with the 2024 Latino Spirit Award from the California Latino Legislative Caucus for her achievement in public service and health. Only a little over 2% of U.S. doctors are Latina women, and Ramos is aware of what her achievements represent: Raised in a one-bedroom apartment in South Central Los Angeles, her Mexican mother sometimes worked three jobs so Ramos could pursue her education. \"When I share that I was the first person in my family to go to college, I have students come up to me and some of them are crying - they say they can see themselves in me,\" she said, \"and that has been the best gift of this job.\"\n\nAuthor Cristina Rivera Garza won one of literature's most esteemed awards this year when she took home the 2024 Pulitzer Prize in memoir or autobiography for \"Liliana's Invincible Summer: A Sister's Search for Justice.\" The true story of her sister, a young woman who was murdered by her former boyfriend in 1990, was so personal to Rivera Garza - a professor at the University of Houston and the head of its creative writing program in Hispanic studies - that she wrote both the Spanish and English versions herself, without a translator. Relying on everything from her sister's letters to police files, the Mexican author and former MacArthur \"genius\" recipient crafted a \"remarkable and genre-defying memoir,\" according to the Pulitzer committee. \"I knew that this story was intimate, personal, painful and absolutely fundamental for me and my family,\" she told NBC News, \"but I didn't really know that it would have such a generous, warm embrace with readers.\" Noting that violence against women is still widespread in both the U.S. and her native Mexico , Rivera Garza said, \"I wanted to convey my sister's, Liliana's, perspective on the world with the kind of sensitivity and freedom that she was always so keen on defending.\"\n\nOne of the world's greatest living jazz artists, trumpeter, pianist and composer Arturo Sandoval is set to become a 2024 Kennedy Center Honoree, the nation's pre-eminent performing arts award, in December. \"This is something I will keep close to my heart for the rest of my days,\" Sandoval told NBC News. The Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient has such a remarkable story, it ' s been made into a movie. At 12, Sandoval was studying classical trumpet, though \"nobody in my family had anything to do with the arts - my dad was a car mechanic. They thought I was completely nuts.\" As a young man, Sandoval was jailed in communist Cuba for listening to a Voice of America jazz program during mandatory military service. Sandoval's life changed when his hero, jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, visited Cuba in 1977. It was while touring with Gillespie in 1989 that Sandoval defected to the U.S., and he credits the musical giant with helping secure his freedom. \"I was a hopeless kid in Cuba, and then music changed me and my life completely. Music saved my life.\" The former music professor still mentors young people . \"It's like passing art to the next generation,\" he said.\n\nIt may surprise some to know that Minnesota Timberwolves center-forward Karl-Anthony Towns, heading into his 10th season in the NBA, had different plans as a kid: \"I always thought I'd be a baseball player for the Yankees, but that was the Dominican in me talking,\" he told NBC News with a smile. At 7 feet tall, it's no surprise his dad encouraged him to play basketball. But the NBA star has done so much more: Towns was honored as the NBA's Social Justice Champion for the 2023-24 season, receiving the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Trophy . A staunch advocate for voting rights, he lobbied for a bipartisan law that helped restore the right to vote to tens of thousands of people in Minnesota who were formerly incarcerated or on parole. He's also used his visibility to raise awareness about the dangers of Covid after losing eight family members , including his beloved mom, during the pandemic. Towns, a global ambassador for World Youth Clubs, told NBC News he'll be announcing a substantial donation to GO Ministries, WYC's partner in the Dominican Republic, to bring more services to youth there. He credits his dad's African American and mom's Dominican cultures with the \"love and teachings\" that shaped him. \"To live the American dream you have to be willing to help others with it,\" Towns said. \"For me to be recognized for what I do off the court is something...all I ever wanted to do. And I think that would make my mother more proud than what I've done on the court.\"\n\nAndrea Vidaurre was one of just six people in the world selected for the 2024 Goldman Environmental Prize , sometimes called the \"Green Nobel Prize.\" As the announcement explained , \"Vidaurre's grassroots leadership persuaded the California Air Resources Board to adopt, in the spring of 2023, two historic transportation regulations that significantly limit trucking and rail emissions,\" including the first emissions rule for trains in the U.S. and a path to 100% zero emissions by 2036 for freight truck sales. Other states have also adopted California's regulations, meaning that Vidaurre's work has had a national impact. Vidaurre, who is Peruvian American, was born and raised in California's Inland Empire, which is east of Los Angeles and has some of the country's worst air quality . Yet Vidaurre has spoken of how different it was when she was growing up enjoying the mountain scenery. After speaking with many of her neighbors, in 2020 Vidaurre co-founded the People's Collective for Environmental Justice , a nonprofit that advocates for clean air quality. \"Many of us advocating for zero-emissions freight use the phrase, 'We're just trying to breathe,'\" Vidaurre said in an interview with Earthjustice . \"The power of this phrase is its simplicity. We're asking for what all living things do, and that's to breathe. It's human nature, and all of us who live in this area deserve to breathe clean, healthy air.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nRaul A.

Amid growing numbers the definition is expanding\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 people in the U.S. are Hispanic, but growth comes with rethinking the terms of a âmixed ethnicity.â\n\nBy Nicole Acevedo, Edwin Flores and Suzanne Gamboa Contributing Reporting by Albinson Linares of Noticias Telemundo, Carmen Sesin, Arturo Conde, Christopher Alvarez Sept. 15, 2022\n\nPara leer en espaÃ±ol haga click aquÃ­\n\nA biracial family in Wisconsin. A Black Dominican in Massachusetts. A Cuban of Lebanese descent in New York. A Mexican Chinese Californian. A white man from Texas. A Brazilian German in Arizona.\n\nLatino identity is becoming more fluid and varied than ever before.\n\nAmid dramatic population growth, rising intermarriage rates, geographic dispersal and the growing use of DNA technology, millions of Americans are expanding the definition of what it means to be of Latino or of Hispanic descent.\n\nAs racial, ethnic and language boundaries evolve, Latinos are defying categorization or definition in narrow terms.\n\nâA lot of people tend to ask me why are there are so many labels â is there an identity crisis?â said sociologist G. Cristina Mora , the author of â Making Hispanics : How Activists, Bureaucrats and Media Constructed a New American.â âSo many labels are an expression of how big we are getting.â\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 Americans , 62.6 million, are Hispanic, according to the latest 2020 census numbers, a 23% increase from 2010.\n\nAmong them are a young man who does genealogy work at low cost, helping others discover their Latino roots. Another uses her native Spanish to reach fellow Latino Muslims through her radio show. A third is at the helm of a university in the countryâs seventh-largest city. Theyâre different in myriad ways â yet they all count themselves as part of the vast and growing community.\n\nâSome people think itâs contradictory to have multiple identities,â said Matthew Reyes, 19, a sophomore at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Thatâs not how he sees it.\n\nReyes was born and raised in Los Angeles; his mother emigrated from Hong Kong and his  Californian father is of Mexican American heritage. Although Reyes sees himself as half Chinese, half Mexican, others often identify him as Asian, because people âcan recognize it more easily,â he said.\n\nMatthew Reyes, seen here with his Mexican-American father, considers himself half-Chinese and half-Mexican.\n\nMatthew Reyes, seen here with his Mexican-American father, considers himself half-Chinese and half-Mexican.\n\nLatinos like Reyes, who are multiracial or have mixed backgrounds, are one of the fastest growing groups, said Jens Manuel Krogstad, a senior writer and editor at the Pew Research Center. Krogstad, who grew up in Minnesota, has a Mexican mother and a white father of Norwegian descent.\n\nThe number of Latinos identifying as more than one race in the 2020 census has grown from 3 million to 20.3 million since 2010, while those identifying as only white dropped drastically, from 26.7 million to 12.6 million.\n\nOne of the drivers of those changes is that Latinos and Asians are the most likely to intermarry . In 2019, almost 4 in 10 U.S.-born Latinos, 39%, married someone who wasnât Hispanic. The majority of Latinos, 70%, are U.S.-born.\n\nReyes acknowledged he flips between his Mexican and Chinese identities âlike a chameleonâ depending on the specific scenario, but he said âit feels greatâ to embrace both sides of his heritage.\n\nâThatâs not to say both cultures are antithetical to being American,â he said. âBut at the same time, assimilation kind of removes you a little bit from your roots. So Iâm always trying to strengthen these connections.â\n\nJuan Zapata and his grandmother, Isabel Garcia, and her partner, Abuelo Ta.\n\nJuan Zapata and his grandmother, Isabel Garcia, and her partner, Abuelo Ta.\n\nIncreased interest in DNA ancestry and genealogy has shifted the way people think about themselves, said Robert Santos, the first Latino to lead the Census Bureau .\n\nâTheir story isnât going to be âIâm this one thing,ââ he said. âItâs primarily going to be âIâm this one thing and this other thing.â... People want to tell their stories.â\n\nAt least four ancestry companies reported substantial increases in their Latino clients since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020. One of them, 23andMe, said it had a 50% jump in new customers of Hispanic descent, while MyHeritage said it had a 20% to 30% increase. FamilyTreeDNA and Ancestry had big increases but didnât say how big.\n\nAs a child in Huntsville, Alabama, Juan Zapata, 25, was bullied for being Mexican. Before he obtained a green card, he also struggled with his lack of legal immigration status after he emigrated from Mexico with his parents. âI was ashamed of those roots,â he said.\n\nThen Zapata, an Army reservist and science fiction enthusiast, became an accidental genealogist on TikTok.\n\nZapata has spent more than 1,000 hours sifting through paper trails to build out his genealogy tree, which dates to the 1500s. He has traced his ancestry to several continents and learned of Indigenous, Sephardic Jewish and African ancestors.\n\nâNow, I love being Mexican. Iâm proud of all my roots,â Zapata said.\n\nTikTok videos with the hashtags #familytree and #genealogy have surpassed 280 million views. Thanks to the topicâs popularity, Zapata turned his passion project into a side hustle with his 5,000 TikTok followers. He charges $25 an hour to help others with their genealogy while still working security at a manufacturing company.\n\nHis clients include Spencer Montoya, 37, of Oregon, who is half white and half Mexican. He explored his Mexican roots years after he lost touch with his fatherâs family following his parentsâ divorce.\n\nSpencer Montoya in Mexico as a child, right, and a photo of his great-great grandfather, Juan Ramirez, and great-great aunt, Librada.\n\nSpencer Montoya in Mexico as a child, right, and a photo of his great-great grandfather, Juan Ramirez, and great-great aunt, Librada.\n\nAnother client, Jason Lopez, 36, of Hawaii, reached out to Zapata after he took a DNA test and learned his genetic makeup is 54% Indigenous. His parents may be from Zacatecas, Mexico, but after his research, âI consider myself more Indigenous or Native American,â Lopez said. âI identify more with that now.â\n\nJason Lopez's great grandfather, Alberto Ramirez, as a small child being held by other family members.\n\nJason Lopez's great grandfather, Alberto Ramirez, as a small child being held by other family members.\n\nFor others, ancestry has led to new geographic connections. Amanda Florian, 27, grew up very familiar with her Puerto Rican motherâs background, visiting her hometown of Arecibo and getting to know the island. But her familyâs new knowledge of her dadâs Irish and Italian roots led to meaningful family visits â and real ties to Europe.\n\nAmanda Florian with her mother and father.\n\nAmanda Florian with her mother and father.\n\nâIt's not like this changed everything for me. It's not like I had a huge coming-of-age moment,â Florian said. âBut it does open a lot of doors. I wanted to feel connected to these roots.â\n\nBecause Latinos are inherently of mixed ethnicity, DNA and ancestry tests often help families get a glimpse of why relatives in the same family can look so widely different. Erick Galindo, 31, an award-winning writer, director, podcast creator and showrunner in Los Angeles, has red hair and light skin. People donât think heâs Latino, and he doesnât look much like his Mexican parents.\n\nâI took the DNA test, and it does really look like a map of Napoleon's plan to conquer the world,â he said. âI have blood from everywhere â my father is a quarter Ethiopian, a little bit Irish. My mother's a little bit Jewish, a little bit Irish, too, French, Italian. A lot. Both have a lot of Spanish, Portuguese. And about 40% of my DNA is Indigenous from Mexico.â\n\nJose Moya's sister's first birthday in Bayamo, Cuba, in 1955.\n\nJose Moya's sister's first birthday in Bayamo, Cuba, in 1955.\n\nJosÃ© Moya Hajje, 69, a Barnard College historian, had paternal great grandparents who hailed from Spain, one of whom married a Black Cuban, and maternal grandparents who were of Lebanese descent. Cuba attracted many Lebanese merchants during the 1910s, Moya said.\n\nAfter Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, Moya was sent away by his family, like thousands of other young boys before they reached 15, Cubaâs military age. After a brief stint in Spain, Moya Hajjer reunited with his family in New Jersey in 1969.\n\nMoya with a chocolate \"Cuba\" cigar in Norway.\n\nMoya with a chocolate \"Cuba\" cigar in Norway.\n\nâWe had a sense of gratitude towards a country that hosted us,â he said about the U.S. But still, âI think of myself as Cuban, really. â¦ That is the place where I was born.â\n\nFor Colombian American Christian LeÃ3n, 48, growing up in his Spanish-speaking household in Tampa, Florida, was a big reason he never really identified as âAmericanâ and didnât embrace his bicultural upbringing until adulthood â even though he was born in the U.S.\n\nHe recalled that his friends came to know his place as the dancing and music house, because his parents, doctors who emigrated from Colombia, were ârumberosâ who hosted big parties.\n\nChristian LeÃ3n grew up in Florida in a Spanish-speaking household.\n\nChristian LeÃ3n grew up in Florida in a Spanish-speaking household.\n\nâIt was very Latino and very CaleÃ±o,â LeÃ3n said, referring to the city of Cali, his parentsâ birthplace.\n\nFor Latinos who are proficient in Spanish, knowing the language has been a way to build community.\n\nVilma Habibah, 52, whose last name was Santos, was born and raised in Puerto Rico. When she started practicing the Muslim religion 25 years ago in New York, she was âone of the few Hispanic Muslim women in Long Island, and I felt super alone,â she said. Now sheâs part of a growing community â and she uses her native language to host âConstruyendo Puentes de Paz,â (âBuilding Bridges of Peaceâ), a Spanish-language show on Americaâs Islamic Radio .\n\nHabibah in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; in Albonito, Puerto Rico, in 1978; and in Mecca in 2022.\n\nHabibah in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; in Albonito, Puerto Rico, in 1978; and in Mecca in 2022.\n\nIn 2017, an estimated 276,000 Muslims in the U.S. â roughly 8% of the countryâs Muslim population â were of Hispanic descent, up from 6% in 2011, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nWhile 88% of Hispanic adults say itâs important for future generations to speak Spanish, later generations are less likely to speak it .\n\nIn Wilson, North Carolina, the 10 Herrera siblings grew up in a traditional Mexican household with immigrant parents who mainly spoke Spanish. Markedly more English is spoken in their home now, said Alberto, the seventh-born, compared to when Flor, the eldest, was born in 1990.\n\nAlberto Herrera and his grandparents, Frajedis Juarez and Sarah Villanueva de Juarez.\n\nAlberto Herrera and his grandparents, Frajedis Juarez and Sarah Villanueva de Juarez.\n\nAlberto, 19, said his youngest siblings, ages 15 and 13, grew up with technology and video games that have âinherently made them more connected to the American side.â Alberto said he embraced the value of his Spanish skills at a construction internship where he was the only person who could communicate with the Spanish-speaking subcontractors.\n\nFlor, 32, chose to own her identity after she turned 18 and was looking to legally change her middle name, Josefina, which she had always hated â until she asked her parents about it.\n\nWhen her parents made the trek from Mexico to the U.S. border, her mom, then pregnant with Flor, became extremely dehydrated and thought she wasnât going to make it. She prayed to San JosÃ© ( St. Joseph) that if she survived, sheâd name her child after him â hence Josefina. Flor kept her middle name.\n\nAlejandro and Irma Herrera with Flor and Alex.\n\nAlejandro and Irma Herrera with Flor and Alex.\n\nFlor and her sister Elizabeth run Casa Azul, a nonprofit organization in their hometown, focusing on helping first-generation college students and promoting Latino culture.\n\nâBecause of my American existence, I know Iâm not white,â Flor said. âI know Iâm not Black. But Iâm Latina.â\n\nAn estimated 5 million American adults with Hispanic ancestry, or 11%, said they donât identify as Hispanic or Latino , according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nGrowing up in Speegleville, Texas, a mostly white community, Matthew Swindall marked âwhiteâ when he was asked about his race or ethnicity at school, he remembers. He felt nobody would believe him if he said he was Hispanic, even though his mother, whose maiden name is Mendoza, is Mexican American.\n\nâEveryone sees my last name, thatâs the whitest name you can have!â Swindall, 39, a red-haired, fair-complexioned police officer, said between laughs.\n\nMatthew Swindall and his grandmother, Sofia Mendoza.\n\nMatthew Swindall and his grandmother, Sofia Mendoza.\n\nHe fondly remembers attending family reunions in South Texas where his great-grandmother understood English but wouldnât speak it. His mother translated but never taught him Spanish, because, as she told him, âI honestly didnât think youâd ever need it,â Swindall said.\n\nNow married to a Mexican American woman and with two children, âI want my kids to know theyâre bothâ white and Hispanic, he said.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry, a vice president and executive editor of an imprint at Random House, describes herself as the daughter of a brown Colombian woman and an âincandescently whiteâ Irish Canadian man.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry with her parents and her Canadian grandparents in Toronto, left; MÃ©ndez Berry, third from left, with cousins in Cali, Colombia, around 2010.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry with her parents and her Canadian grandparents in Toronto, left; MÃ©ndez Berry, third from left, with cousins in Cali, Colombia, around 2010.\n\nShe has been working on a book about a formerly incarcerated man who has a common Latino last name. But in every record she found of him, he was categorized as white. âI donât think we are being counted well at this point,â she said.\n\nMÃ©ndez Berry feels âvery closeâ to her Latino identity, but she said itâs important for light-skinned Latinos like her âto acknowledge our whiteness and our privilege.â\n\nMirabella Isais, 22, whoâs Mexican and Russian, found herself distancing herself from her Latino roots as she navigated middle school in West Covina, California, blending in with other lighter-skinned kids so she wouldnât have to deal with the bullying she saw other Latino students face.\n\nâI was very scared,â Isais said. âI would almost try to hide it and pretend like it wasnât there.â\n\nIt wasnât until college, as she got closer to her half-Salvadoran and half-Mexican best friend, that Isais felt more comfortable owning her Latino side. âItâs the first thing that I say when people talk to me. Iâm half Russian, half Mexican. Itâs so important to me.â\n\nAbel ChÃ¡vez, 43, the first Latino president of Our Lady of the Lake University, a Hispanic-serving institution in San Antonio, said heâs Spanish, French and German from his fatherâs side and Tarahumara, an Indigenous people from Mexico, from his maternal grandfather.\n\nHe identifies as Chicano and marks that on census forms. Itâs an identity reflected in his passion for lowrider cars, which his father showed him how to build â and which inspired ChÃ¡vezâs eventual career as a mechanical engineer.\n\nAbel ChÃ¡vez, first Latino president of Our Lady of the Lake University, on the campus in San Antonio, Texas.

(Courtesy of Our Lady of the Lake University)\n\nOn the race question, he also checks off âwhite,â a nod to his family nickname, âEl GÃ1⁄4ero,â a  reference to his light skin. Nonetheless, ChÃ¡vez solidly proclaimed, âI have no doubt that I am mestizo.â The complexity of his identity allows him to be an academic executive and a lowrider fanatic, he said. âYou are one and you are the other,â he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Cindy Medina, 47,-a genealogist from Texas, feels more comfortable embracing her European roots, which she attributes to her fatherâs lineage.\n\nShe manages the New Spain and Mexico Facebook page, where she posts about Spanish, Mexican and Indigenous history.\n\nMedinaâs great-great grandparents, Miguel and Pilar Vidal from Chihuahua City; Medina in El Paso, Texas; and five generations of women in Medinaâs family in the late 1970s.\n\nMedinaâs great-great grandparents, Miguel and Pilar Vidal from Chihuahua City; Medina in El Paso, Texas; and five generations of women in Medinaâs family in the late 1970s.\n\nMedina is of Mexican descent, but sheâs more likely to promote her Spanish heritage when sheâs speaking to âAnglos,â she said.\n\nâWith white people, I push it. They think they are European. Well, Iâm European and have been for longer,â she said, explaining the history of the Spanish colonial settlers who inhabited a wide swath of what is now the U.S. Southwest and West. Medinaâs efforts have at times put her at odds with relatives who identify as Chicano, she said.\n\nâAs Mexican Americans, as Spanish Americans, we must understand each other. We are the ones with the history,â Medina said. âIâm not going to let someone else tell me otherwise.â\n\nAnne HernÃ¡ndez.\n\nAnne HernÃ¡ndez.\n\nRace is still the biggest factor in the way many Latinos see themselves â and the way others see them.\n\nFifty-seven percent of Hispanic adults the Pew Research Center surveyed last year said skin color shapes their daily life experiences, and 62% said they believe having darker skin hurts their ability to get ahead in the U.S.\n\nMassachusetts resident Anne HernÃ¡ndez, 46, a Black Dominican, recalled a recent conversation with her son, a high school junior who is half Haitian, about where he was thinking of applying to college.\n\nThere were âso many statesâ where he didnât want to be, he told her, on account of his color. âIt was so painful to hear him say that,â she said. âHe belongs wherever he wants to be, but people are going to make him feel like he doesnât.â\n\nAs much as she warns her son about the difficulties he may encounter, HernÃ¡ndez, who said she has ânever had a problem with being Black,â said she strives to be an example, instilling racial and cultural pride in her family.\n\nWhen her son is asked about his background, he doesnât say just âAmerican,â even though he was born in the U.S., HernÃ¡ndez said. âHe says Dominican and Haitian. I love that he does that.â\n\nThere are about 6 million Afro Latinos in the U.S., about 12% of the adult Latino population.\n\nThere are more people of African descent in Latin America and the Caribbean than in the U.S., about 200 million compared to 47 million , âand people are still asking if weâre Black,â said Yvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian who founded the organization Encuentro Diaspora Afro in Boston 25 years ago.\n\nYvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian woman.\n\nYvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian woman.\n\nZapata, the genealogist from Alabama, said he got backlash from people who refused to acknowledge Latinosâ Black heritage after he posted about his 52 African ancestors on TikTok. Some followers were offended and even accused him of being incorrect, Zapata said.\n\nSpeaking of the terms \"Latinidad\" and \"Afro Latino,\" Modestin said: âWe have to acknowledge that Latinidad in this country leans into whiteness. As long as that continues to happen, then we will constantly be in a struggle to bring these two terms together.â\n\nNorma Duckworth, who is Mexican American, is married to an African American man. She and her family recently had to move to a different suburb in Wisconsin after a traumatic incident with a âhatefully racistâ neighbor, who called her son a racial slur.\n\nâPeople do look at you differently,â said Duckworth, âbecause you married somebody that's out of your own ethnic background.â\n\nFrom making tamales during the holidays to celebrating her daughterâs quinceaÃ±era, she and her husband have been adamant about passing their respective cultures down to their children.\n\nNorma Duckworth, right, with her daughter, Aliah, and her husband.\n\nNorma Duckworth, right, with her daughter, Aliah, and her husband.\n\nBut that doesnât stop others, said Duckworthâs daughter Aliah, 18, from pressuring mixed-race people like her to pick a side.\n\nâI never understood why. If you are two things, why do you have to pick one?â said Aliah, who considers herself biracial.\n\nThe term \"Afro Latino\" resonates with her, Aliah said, because it mixes âboth of the terms of what I am.â\n\nFor later generations of Latinos and those who are mixed, claiming âtheir Latino identity will be an active choice they make,â said Krogstad of the Pew Research Center. âExpressing their Latino identity will require a certain amount of work and a certain amount of pride in their background.â\n\nRichard Abraham Rugnao, who is half Mexican American and half Filipino, started making that âactive choiceâ at age 23 when he began working for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. Growing up, âbeing Latinoâ wasnât celebrated, he said.\n\nThe job âreally lit a fire in me â it began to shift my perspective around my own heritage,â said Rugnao, 51. It also helped him better understand why his Mexican mother, who lived in a migrant camp in California as a child, marched with CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez in the 1960s.\n\nIn Arizona, Julianna Schrader, 18, embraces her mixed Brazilian German background, despite being perceived as only white.

      "text": "Who's Latino? Amid growing numbers the definition is expanding\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 people in the U.S. are Hispanic, but growth comes with rethinking the terms of a âmixed ethnicity.â\n\nBy Nicole Acevedo, Edwin Flores and Suzanne Gamboa Contributing Reporting by Albinson Linares of Noticias Telemundo, Carmen Sesin, Arturo Conde, Christopher Alvarez Sept. 15, 2022\n\nPara leer en espaÃ±ol haga click aquÃ­\n\nA biracial family in Wisconsin. A Black Dominican in Massachusetts. A Cuban of Lebanese descent in New York. A Mexican Chinese Californian. A white man from Texas. A Brazilian German in Arizona.\n\nLatino identity is becoming more fluid and varied than ever before.\n\nAmid dramatic population growth, rising intermarriage rates, geographic dispersal and the growing use of DNA technology, millions of Americans are expanding the definition of what it means to be of Latino or of Hispanic descent.\n\nAs racial, ethnic and language boundaries evolve, Latinos are defying categorization or definition in narrow terms.\n\nâA lot of people tend to ask me why are there are so many labels â is there an identity crisis?â said sociologist G. Cristina Mora , the author of â Making Hispanics : How Activists, Bureaucrats and Media Constructed a New American.â âSo many labels are an expression of how big we are getting.â\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 Americans , 62.6 million, are Hispanic, according to the latest 2020 census numbers, a 23% increase from 2010.\n\nAmong them are a young man who does genealogy work at low cost, helping others discover their Latino roots. Another uses her native Spanish to reach fellow Latino Muslims through her radio show. A third is at the helm of a university in the countryâs seventh-largest city. Theyâre different in myriad ways â yet they all count themselves as part of the vast and growing community.\n\nâSome people think itâs contradictory to have multiple identities,â said Matthew Reyes, 19, a sophomore at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Thatâs not how he sees it.\n\nReyes was born and raised in Los Angeles; his mother emigrated from Hong Kong and his  Californian father is of Mexican American heritage. Although Reyes sees himself as half Chinese, half Mexican, others often identify him as Asian, because people âcan recognize it more easily,â he said.\n\nMatthew Reyes, seen here with his Mexican-American father, considers himself half-Chinese and half-Mexican.\n\nMatthew Reyes, seen here with his Mexican-American father, considers himself half-Chinese and half-Mexican.\n\nLatinos like Reyes, who are multiracial or have mixed backgrounds, are one of the fastest growing groups, said Jens Manuel Krogstad, a senior writer and editor at the Pew Research Center. Krogstad, who grew up in Minnesota, has a Mexican mother and a white father of Norwegian descent.\n\nThe number of Latinos identifying as more than one race in the 2020 census has grown from 3 million to 20.3 million since 2010, while those identifying as only white dropped drastically, from 26.7 million to 12.6 million.\n\nOne of the drivers of those changes is that Latinos and Asians are the most likely to intermarry . In 2019, almost 4 in 10 U.S.-born Latinos, 39%, married someone who wasnât Hispanic. The majority of Latinos, 70%, are U.S.-born.\n\nReyes acknowledged he flips between his Mexican and Chinese identities âlike a chameleonâ depending on the specific scenario, but he said âit feels greatâ to embrace both sides of his heritage.\n\nâThatâs not to say both cultures are antithetical to being American,â he said. âBut at the same time, assimilation kind of removes you a little bit from your roots. So Iâm always trying to strengthen these connections.â\n\nJuan Zapata and his grandmother, Isabel Garcia, and her partner, Abuelo Ta.\n\nJuan Zapata and his grandmother, Isabel Garcia, and her partner, Abuelo Ta.\n\nIncreased interest in DNA ancestry and genealogy has shifted the way people think about themselves, said Robert Santos, the first Latino to lead the Census Bureau .\n\nâTheir story isnât going to be âIâm this one thing,ââ he said. âItâs primarily going to be âIâm this one thing and this other thing.â... People want to tell their stories.â\n\nAt least four ancestry companies reported substantial increases in their Latino clients since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020. One of them, 23andMe, said it had a 50% jump in new customers of Hispanic descent, while MyHeritage said it had a 20% to 30% increase. FamilyTreeDNA and Ancestry had big increases but didnât say how big.\n\nAs a child in Huntsville, Alabama, Juan Zapata, 25, was bullied for being Mexican. Before he obtained a green card, he also struggled with his lack of legal immigration status after he emigrated from Mexico with his parents. âI was ashamed of those roots,â he said.\n\nThen Zapata, an Army reservist and science fiction enthusiast, became an accidental genealogist on TikTok.\n\nZapata has spent more than 1,000 hours sifting through paper trails to build out his genealogy tree, which dates to the 1500s. He has traced his ancestry to several continents and learned of Indigenous, Sephardic Jewish and African ancestors.\n\nâNow, I love being Mexican. Iâm proud of all my roots,â Zapata said.\n\nTikTok videos with the hashtags #familytree and #genealogy have surpassed 280 million views. Thanks to the topicâs popularity, Zapata turned his passion project into a side hustle with his 5,000 TikTok followers. He charges $25 an hour to help others with their genealogy while still working security at a manufacturing company.\n\nHis clients include Spencer Montoya, 37, of Oregon, who is half white and half Mexican. He explored his Mexican roots years after he lost touch with his fatherâs family following his parentsâ divorce.\n\nSpencer Montoya in Mexico as a child, right, and a photo of his great-great grandfather, Juan Ramirez, and great-great aunt, Librada.\n\nSpencer Montoya in Mexico as a child, right, and a photo of his great-great grandfather, Juan Ramirez, and great-great aunt, Librada.\n\nAnother client, Jason Lopez, 36, of Hawaii, reached out to Zapata after he took a DNA test and learned his genetic makeup is 54% Indigenous. His parents may be from Zacatecas, Mexico, but after his research, âI consider myself more Indigenous or Native American,â Lopez said. âI identify more with that now.â\n\nJason Lopez's great grandfather, Alberto Ramirez, as a small child being held by other family members.\n\nJason Lopez's great grandfather, Alberto Ramirez, as a small child being held by other family members.\n\nFor others, ancestry has led to new geographic connections. Amanda Florian, 27, grew up very familiar with her Puerto Rican motherâs background, visiting her hometown of Arecibo and getting to know the island. But her familyâs new knowledge of her dadâs Irish and Italian roots led to meaningful family visits â and real ties to Europe.\n\nAmanda Florian with her mother and father.\n\nAmanda Florian with her mother and father.\n\nâIt's not like this changed everything for me. It's not like I had a huge coming-of-age moment,â Florian said. âBut it does open a lot of doors. I wanted to feel connected to these roots.â\n\nBecause Latinos are inherently of mixed ethnicity, DNA and ancestry tests often help families get a glimpse of why relatives in the same family can look so widely different. Erick Galindo, 31, an award-winning writer, director, podcast creator and showrunner in Los Angeles, has red hair and light skin. People donât think heâs Latino, and he doesnât look much like his Mexican parents.\n\nâI took the DNA test, and it does really look like a map of Napoleon's plan to conquer the world,â he said. âI have blood from everywhere â my father is a quarter Ethiopian, a little bit Irish. My mother's a little bit Jewish, a little bit Irish, too, French, Italian. A lot. Both have a lot of Spanish, Portuguese. And about 40% of my DNA is Indigenous from Mexico.â\n\nJose Moya's sister's first birthday in Bayamo, Cuba, in 1955.\n\nJose Moya's sister's first birthday in Bayamo, Cuba, in 1955.\n\nJosÃ© Moya Hajje, 69, a Barnard College historian, had paternal great grandparents who hailed from Spain, one of whom married a Black Cuban, and maternal grandparents who were of Lebanese descent. Cuba attracted many Lebanese merchants during the 1910s, Moya said.\n\nAfter Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, Moya was sent away by his family, like thousands of other young boys before they reached 15, Cubaâs military age. After a brief stint in Spain, Moya Hajjer reunited with his family in New Jersey in 1969.\n\nMoya with a chocolate \"Cuba\" cigar in Norway.\n\nMoya with a chocolate \"Cuba\" cigar in Norway.\n\nâWe had a sense of gratitude towards a country that hosted us,â he said about the U.S. But still, âI think of myself as Cuban, really. â¦ That is the place where I was born.â\n\nFor Colombian American Christian LeÃ3n, 48, growing up in his Spanish-speaking household in Tampa, Florida, was a big reason he never really identified as âAmericanâ and didnât embrace his bicultural upbringing until adulthood â even though he was born in the U.S.\n\nHe recalled that his friends came to know his place as the dancing and music house, because his parents, doctors who emigrated from Colombia, were ârumberosâ who hosted big parties.\n\nChristian LeÃ3n grew up in Florida in a Spanish-speaking household.\n\nChristian LeÃ3n grew up in Florida in a Spanish-speaking household.\n\nâIt was very Latino and very CaleÃ±o,â LeÃ3n said, referring to the city of Cali, his parentsâ birthplace.\n\nFor Latinos who are proficient in Spanish, knowing the language has been a way to build community.\n\nVilma Habibah, 52, whose last name was Santos, was born and raised in Puerto Rico. When she started practicing the Muslim religion 25 years ago in New York, she was âone of the few Hispanic Muslim women in Long Island, and I felt super alone,â she said. Now sheâs part of a growing community â and she uses her native language to host âConstruyendo Puentes de Paz,â (âBuilding Bridges of Peaceâ), a Spanish-language show on Americaâs Islamic Radio .\n\nHabibah in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; in Albonito, Puerto Rico, in 1978; and in Mecca in 2022.\n\nHabibah in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; in Albonito, Puerto Rico, in 1978; and in Mecca in 2022.\n\nIn 2017, an estimated 276,000 Muslims in the U.S. â roughly 8% of the countryâs Muslim population â were of Hispanic descent, up from 6% in 2011, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nWhile 88% of Hispanic adults say itâs important for future generations to speak Spanish, later generations are less likely to speak it .\n\nIn Wilson, North Carolina, the 10 Herrera siblings grew up in a traditional Mexican household with immigrant parents who mainly spoke Spanish. Markedly more English is spoken in their home now, said Alberto, the seventh-born, compared to when Flor, the eldest, was born in 1990.\n\nAlberto Herrera and his grandparents, Frajedis Juarez and Sarah Villanueva de Juarez.\n\nAlberto Herrera and his grandparents, Frajedis Juarez and Sarah Villanueva de Juarez.\n\nAlberto, 19, said his youngest siblings, ages 15 and 13, grew up with technology and video games that have âinherently made them more connected to the American side.â Alberto said he embraced the value of his Spanish skills at a construction internship where he was the only person who could communicate with the Spanish-speaking subcontractors.\n\nFlor, 32, chose to own her identity after she turned 18 and was looking to legally change her middle name, Josefina, which she had always hated â until she asked her parents about it.\n\nWhen her parents made the trek from Mexico to the U.S. border, her mom, then pregnant with Flor, became extremely dehydrated and thought she wasnât going to make it. She prayed to San JosÃ© ( St. Joseph) that if she survived, sheâd name her child after him â hence Josefina. Flor kept her middle name.\n\nAlejandro and Irma Herrera with Flor and Alex.\n\nAlejandro and Irma Herrera with Flor and Alex.\n\nFlor and her sister Elizabeth run Casa Azul, a nonprofit organization in their hometown, focusing on helping first-generation college students and promoting Latino culture.\n\nâBecause of my American existence, I know Iâm not white,â Flor said. âI know Iâm not Black. But Iâm Latina.â\n\nAn estimated 5 million American adults with Hispanic ancestry, or 11%, said they donât identify as Hispanic or Latino , according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nGrowing up in Speegleville, Texas, a mostly white community, Matthew Swindall marked âwhiteâ when he was asked about his race or ethnicity at school, he remembers. He felt nobody would believe him if he said he was Hispanic, even though his mother, whose maiden name is Mendoza, is Mexican American.\n\nâEveryone sees my last name, thatâs the whitest name you can have!â Swindall, 39, a red-haired, fair-complexioned police officer, said between laughs.\n\nMatthew Swindall and his grandmother, Sofia Mendoza.\n\nMatthew Swindall and his grandmother, Sofia Mendoza.\n\nHe fondly remembers attending family reunions in South Texas where his great-grandmother understood English but wouldnât speak it. His mother translated but never taught him Spanish, because, as she told him, âI honestly didnât think youâd ever need it,â Swindall said.\n\nNow married to a Mexican American woman and with two children, âI want my kids to know theyâre bothâ white and Hispanic, he said.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry, a vice president and executive editor of an imprint at Random House, describes herself as the daughter of a brown Colombian woman and an âincandescently whiteâ Irish Canadian man.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry with her parents and her Canadian grandparents in Toronto, left; MÃ©ndez Berry, third from left, with cousins in Cali, Colombia, around 2010.\n\nElizabeth MÃ©ndez Berry with her parents and her Canadian grandparents in Toronto, left; MÃ©ndez Berry, third from left, with cousins in Cali, Colombia, around 2010.\n\nShe has been working on a book about a formerly incarcerated man who has a common Latino last name. But in every record she found of him, he was categorized as white. âI donât think we are being counted well at this point,â she said.\n\nMÃ©ndez Berry feels âvery closeâ to her Latino identity, but she said itâs important for light-skinned Latinos like her âto acknowledge our whiteness and our privilege.â\n\nMirabella Isais, 22, whoâs Mexican and Russian, found herself distancing herself from her Latino roots as she navigated middle school in West Covina, California, blending in with other lighter-skinned kids so she wouldnât have to deal with the bullying she saw other Latino students face.\n\nâI was very scared,â Isais said. âI would almost try to hide it and pretend like it wasnât there.â\n\nIt wasnât until college, as she got closer to her half-Salvadoran and half-Mexican best friend, that Isais felt more comfortable owning her Latino side. âItâs the first thing that I say when people talk to me. Iâm half Russian, half Mexican. Itâs so important to me.â\n\nAbel ChÃ¡vez, 43, the first Latino president of Our Lady of the Lake University, a Hispanic-serving institution in San Antonio, said heâs Spanish, French and German from his fatherâs side and Tarahumara, an Indigenous people from Mexico, from his maternal grandfather.\n\nHe identifies as Chicano and marks that on census forms. Itâs an identity reflected in his passion for lowrider cars, which his father showed him how to build â and which inspired ChÃ¡vezâs eventual career as a mechanical engineer.\n\nAbel ChÃ¡vez, first Latino president of Our Lady of the Lake University, on the campus in San Antonio, Texas.

(Courtesy of Our Lady of the Lake University)\n\nOn the race question, he also checks off âwhite,â a nod to his family nickname, âEl GÃ1⁄4ero,â a  reference to his light skin. Nonetheless, ChÃ¡vez solidly proclaimed, âI have no doubt that I am mestizo.â The complexity of his identity allows him to be an academic executive and a lowrider fanatic, he said. âYou are one and you are the other,â he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Cindy Medina, 47,-a genealogist from Texas, feels more comfortable embracing her European roots, which she attributes to her fatherâs lineage.\n\nShe manages the New Spain and Mexico Facebook page, where she posts about Spanish, Mexican and Indigenous history.\n\nMedinaâs great-great grandparents, Miguel and Pilar Vidal from Chihuahua City; Medina in El Paso, Texas; and five generations of women in Medinaâs family in the late 1970s.\n\nMedinaâs great-great grandparents, Miguel and Pilar Vidal from Chihuahua City; Medina in El Paso, Texas; and five generations of women in Medinaâs family in the late 1970s.\n\nMedina is of Mexican descent, but sheâs more likely to promote her Spanish heritage when sheâs speaking to âAnglos,â she said.\n\nâWith white people, I push it. They think they are European. Well, Iâm European and have been for longer,â she said, explaining the history of the Spanish colonial settlers who inhabited a wide swath of what is now the U.S. Southwest and West.

I love that he does that.â\n\nThere are about 6 million Afro Latinos in the U.S., about 12% of the adult Latino population.\n\nThere are more people of African descent in Latin America and the Caribbean than in the U.S., about 200 million compared to 47 million , âand people are still asking if weâre Black,â said Yvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian who founded the organization Encuentro Diaspora Afro in Boston 25 years ago.\n\nYvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian woman.\n\nYvette Modestin, a Black Panamanian woman.\n\nZapata, the genealogist from Alabama, said he got backlash from people who refused to acknowledge Latinosâ Black heritage after he posted about his 52 African ancestors on TikTok.

Meet the faces of a new era.\n\n(Chelsea Stahl / NBC News)\n\n(Chelsea Stahl / NBC News)\n\nBy Suzanne Gamboa and Nicole Acevedo Sept. 15, 2021\n\nIn New Hampshire, a Roman Catholic church where Irish and French Canadian immigrants used to worship now has the state's largest Latino congregation. In the Deep South, a county in Georgia is one of the nation's top 10 in diversity.\n\nHispanics accounted for over half of the nation's population growth in the last decade. This is not just reflected in larger cities, but in mountain towns, Southern neighborhoods and Midwestern prairies.\n\n\"The Latino population has been dispersing across the United States for years - a reflection of where the nation's population is moving and where opportunities are located,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nLopez, whose Mexican American family has been in California for over a century, has seen dispersion in his own family, with relatives moving to Washington state, Nevada, North Carolina and New Jersey as they followed job, educational and military opportunities, mirroring some of the data he and his team have recorded over the years.\n\nThough a majority of Latinos - almost 70 percent - are U.S. born, Lopez noted that as \"you see Hispanics pursuing opportunity around the country, oftentimes immigrants are leading the way\" in terms of moving to places with new economic opportunities.\n\nLissy Samantha Suazo in Bozeman, Mont., on Aug. 25.

(Adrian Sanchez Gonzalez for NBC News)\n\nFor Lissy Samantha Suazo, 18, the open space of Big Sky, Montana - a small town near Yellowstone National Park - has been a beginning to wider, bigger possibilities.\n\n\"When I arrived here in Big Sky, I was the second person of color and Spanish-speaking person in the school and the first one who didn't know how to speak English,\" said Suazo, who was 12 when her family came from Honduras.\n\nWaded Cruzado's journey through Montana started a few years earlier than Suazo's. She was hired in 2010 as president of Montana State University in Bozeman.\n\n\"I remember saying, 'You know, I have never been to Montana. ... Do you know what I look like? I don't look like and sound like anyone in Montana,'\" said Cruzado, 61, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico. \"But I was wrong.\"\n\nWaded Cruzado, the president of Montana State University, welcomes freshmen students at Bobcat Stadium on Aug. 24.

(Courtesy of MSU Communications)\n\nHispanics have been in Montana since the early 1800s as fur traders, ranchers, rail workers and laborers in beet fields, according to Bridget Kevane, professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at Montana State University.\n\nBut in the last two decades, Montana has been among the states with the fastest growing Latino populations in the country. Though the 45,199 Latinos who live in Montana are minuscule  compared to the 15.6 million Hispanics who live in California, the state's 58.2 percent jump in Latino residents since 2010 leads all U.S. western states over the last decade.\n\nThe timber industry in the northern part of the state and oil jobs in the east have drawn Latino workers, as have resorts in Bozeman and Big Sky, Kevane said.\n\n\"Scholars say this is a non-gateway state, meaning there wasn't already a settled community,\" Kevane said of North Dakota. \"But it might be in the next 20 years.\"\n\nSuazo and Cruzado became part of that last decade of Latino growth amid the majestic outdoors - and the bracing winters.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, that's one of the things I had a hard time adjusting to, but now I love the cold and now I love the snow,\" said Suazo, who regularly enjoys hiking and walking.\n\nSuazo's family was in New York after coming from Honduras when her father got a call to come work in Big Sky. Since then, Suazo has taken advantage of the opportunities available to her.\n\nNow in her senior year in high school, the straight-A student is spending a semester at a leadership academy in South Africa and has found meaning beyond academics, starting with when she helped a fellow Honduran student learn English and get her bearings.\n\nSuazo expanded on that by starting a Latino student union in her high school, creating a nonprofit group, GLAM , to assist people in other countries, including Honduras, and starting a Spanish-language newspaper, Noticias Montaña , with friends that among other things keeps Montana Latinos informed on local issues, including Covid-related information.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it is the impact that I make that makes me feel successful,\" Suazo said.\n\nLissy and her father, Marvin Suazo, in Bozeman, Mont., on Aug. 25.

In 2009, after a national search, she landed MSU's lead job.\n\nEleven years since taking the helm, Cruzado has put her stamp on the institution, helping ensure it lives up to its mission as a land grant university, originally intended to educate the children of America's working families.\n\n\"At MSU, we are not going to chase privilege. We are going to choose promise,\" Cruzado said, a phrase she regularly emphasizes. \"If we are able to convey that message to anyone out there - our Native American students or Latino students or African American students or Asian students, our students from rural communities in Montana, what happens if we give them the chance?\"\n\nCruzado has launched a campaign to increase the average course credits taken by first-year students as well as a program to enroll more young people who are on the fence about college.\n\nAlthough she wishes she could see her granddaughters in Puerto Rico more often, Cruzado said she's found a kinship in the work ethic of the state's residents.\n\nShe shares her Puerto Rican cooking with fellow Montanans and loves camping, soaking up the state's stunning natural sites.\n\n\"I don't focus on the differences,\" she said. \"I focus on what we can we accomplish together.\"\n\nRafael Almonte with a customer at La Fama, his barbershop, in Nashua, N.H, on Sept. 11. (Philip Keith for NBC News)\n\nRafael Almonte with a customer at La Fama, his barbershop, in Nashua, N.H, on Sept. 11. (Philip Keith for NBC News)\n\nRafael Almonte frequently found himself in his grandfather's barber shop as a little kid in the Dominican Republic. Decades later, he established his own in one of the nation's least diverse states, New Hampshire.\n\nAt La Fama barber shop in Nashua, Fridays and Saturdays are busy, especially in the evenings, when many clients come by after they're done with work.\n\nThe business that Almonte, 50, opened in 2004 has become \"like the station for the community,\" he said, where newcomers can learn what companies have job postings and what apartments are available.\n\n\"A lot of the construction guys, they also come to the barber shop and say, 'I need five guys, or I need three guys,'\" he said.\n\nThe barber shop even served as a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination center this past summer. In collaboration with the state's Health Department, the shop helped to vaccinate up to 30 people a day, many of them Spanish speakers with no access to vaccine information in their native language, Almonte said.\n\nAlmonte was 14 when his family moved to southern New Hampshire in the mid-1980s, after his father was recruited to work for a company as a \"tallador\" - someone who designs and carves wooden coffins.\n\n(Philip Keith for NBC News)\n\n(Philip Keith for NBC News)\n\nWhen Almonte started school, there were essentially no Latinos in his community; he was among nearly 6,000 Hispanics in the state at the time. Now, he's one of the more than 59,000 Latinos living in the state, according to the 2020 census.\n\nAs the second-largest racial or ethnic group in New Hampshire, Latinos were pivotal to the state's recent milestone: For the first time, the percentage of people of color reached double digits, with nearly 12 percent of the state's 1.38 million people identifying as Hispanic or nonwhite in the 2020 census count .\n\nAround the time Almonte's family moved to New Hampshire, Latinos of Mexican descent were also moving to work in construction, landscaping and service industries; in the 1990s, migrant workers from Guatemala and Mexico came to work on dairy farms.\n\nThere's also been movement from nearby Massachusetts: Latinos from the more urban, heavily Hispanic cities of Lawrence and Lowell also started moving to New Hampshire for employment opportunities and more affordable housing. These included Dominicans and Puerto Ricans who settled mostly in Nashua and Manchester in Hillsborough County, where more than half of the state's Latinos live.\n\nIn Manchester, the St. Anne-St. Augustin Catholic Parish houses the state's largest Spanish-speaking congregation, with around 2,000 Latino members. Generations before, the church used to serve Irish and French-Canadian immigrants.\n\nThe first group of Hispanics to immigrate to New Hampshire were Uruguayans, who came to the state about 40 years ago to work in textile mills, according to Eva Castillo, a longtime Latina and immigrant rights advocate who has lived in the state for nearly three decades. They were followed by Colombians, who moved to New Hampshire after missionaries from the church visited the South American nation.\n\n\"Most of these families settled here, and they're in their third and even fourth generation - they have completely assimilated,\" Castillo, who's originally from Venezuela, said in her native Spanish.\n\nWhen Almonte opened his barber shop, it was one of the few Latino-owned businesses in Nashua.\n\nThe barber shop even served as a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination center this past summer.

(Philip Keith for NBC News)\n\n\"Right now, we have a lot of restaurants - Mexican, Honduran, Dominican,\" he said. \"They're getting used to us.\"\n\nAlmonte's adult children, from 19 to 27 years old, have come to appreciate their New England upbringing. Despite living in other places - Almonte lived in New Jersey and Florida before returning to New Hampshire - they tell their dad that they want to set roots in the city his dad moved to as a teen. It's a place where they can get a good job and live an affordable life.\n\n\"That's what has continuously brought people back to Nashua,\" he said.\n\nChef and entrepreneur Omar Pereney places fish onto a tray at his test kitchen in Houston on Sept. 13.

(Sergio Flores for NBC News)\n\nHouston resident Omar Pereney started cooking in Venezuelan restaurants at age 13. He had his own TV cooking show in the Argentinian El Gourmet cable channel by 14, became the youngest instructor at Le Cordon Bleu in Mexico at 18 and by his early 20s was a chef to former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nPereney, 27, born in Caracas, Venezuela, moved to Texas from Mexico in 2010. He's certainly adopted the idea that in Texas, you go big.\n\n\"I think I'm in the early days of an empire,\" Pereney said about his latest undertaking, Culinary Matters , a consulting business he opened in March. The company works with restaurateurs to build their businesses, from concepts and menus to interior design and labor and location advice.\n\nTexas is the state with the largest absolute growth of Latinos in the last decade, almost 2 million more than in 2010. That has pushed the number of Hispanics in the state - which was once a part of Mexico along with nine other states in the West, Southwest and Midwest - to being nearly even with non-Hispanic whites.\n\nMexican Americans are the border state's largest Latino group - including families who have been there longer than Texas has been a state.\n\nBut in 2000, 17 percent of Texas Latinos were not of Mexican descent, according to Pew Research Center. In the last two decades, a growing number of Texas Hispanics have included Salvadorans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, people who tie their origins to Spain and many South Americans, all drawn by the state's booming economy, tech hubs and proximity to the Mexican border.\n\nPereney describes himself as \"a Doogie Howser of Hispanic cooking.\" (Sergio Flores for NBC News)\n\nPereney describes himself as \"a Doogie Howser of Hispanic cooking.\" (Sergio Flores for NBC News)\n\nVenezuelans leaving their country's political and economic turmoil were the fastest-growing Latino group in the U.S. during the last decade, said Lopez, of the Pew Research Center.\n\nMany ended up in Texas, mostly in the Houston area, drawn by the oil and gas industry. In fact, so many Venezuelans can be found in the suburban city of Katy that it came to be called Katyzuela over the past decade.\n\nTexas has the second-largest Venezuelan American population, behind Florida, going from 20,162 in 2010 to about 73,000, according to the 2010 census and 2019 population estimates.\n\nPereney said many of his Venezuelan friends, with whom he gathers with regularly for rounds of Truco, a card game popular in South America, are engineers or other employees in the oil and gas business.\n\nPereney, who described himself as \"a Doogie Howser of Hispanic cooking,\" first traveled to the U.S. at 17 to cook and learn from acclaimed Cuban American chef and restaurateur Douglas Rodriguez in several cities. He followed that with a tapas restaurant in Cancún, Mexico, and later working as a corporate chef in Mexico City. His employers moved him to Houston to cook at Peska, a seafood restaurant.\n\nHe was soon recruited to be chef to the first President Bush and his wife, Barbara, who were Houston residents after they left the White House.\n\n(Sergio Flores for NBC News)\n\n(Sergio Flores for NBC News)\n\n\"They lived down the street from Peska, so they'd order food from my restaurant, which I didn't know,\" said Pereney. \" I basically worked with them until they passed. It was an awesome experience.\"\n\nPereney currently owns a home and two businesses in Texas, but recognizes there's always the possibility of change. \"Life is a matter of moments and where you're at that moment,\" he said. \"I have high hopes for the future, but I try not to lose sight of where I am today.\"\n\nAlfredo Corona in his car at Rhodes Jordan Park in Lawrenceville, Ga., on Sept 10.

(Piera Moore for NBC News)\n\nWhen Alfredo Corona, 26, is not working at his mother's commercial cleaning business, he's either making Chicano rap music or attending lowrider car shows in the Atlanta metropolitan area, where he was born and raised.\n\n\"When we drive our cars, we always play our music,\" Corona said. \"It's so intertwined.\"\n\nThe states from the Southwest to the Southeast have accounted for nearly half of the Latino population growth nationwide since 2010. In the southeastern states, the Latino population has grown by 29 percent.\n\nYoung U.S.-born Latinos such as Corona have been the driving force behind this growth.\n\n\"Today, only about 32 percent of all Latinos were born outside the United States,\" Pew Research's Lopez said.\n\nCorona grew up immersed in Mexican culture; though his mother was born in El Salvador, she embraced his father's Mexican heritage. Corona learned Spanish at home and English at school, like other multicultural families who were increasingly settling in Gwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta.\n\n(Piera Moore for NBC News)\n\n(Piera Moore for NBC News)\n\n\"We were kind of starting to be that wave of brown folks who moved to Lawrenceville,\" Corona said. He remembers classmates from the Caribbean, Latin America and even Bosnia.\n\nGwinnett County is now among the nation's top 10 counties for diversity , based on an index that measures the probability that two people chosen at random will be from different racial and ethnic groups, according to the 2020 census . It's also the county with the largest number of Latinos in the state, about 220,460.\n\nSomewhere between home and school, Corona was exposed to Chicano rap - a subgenre of hip-hop that centers around the experiences of people of Mexican descent born in the U.S. - as well as lowrider culture, derived from the vibrant customized vintage cars with low-to-the-ground hydraulic suspension.\n\n\"It was music that helped me open my eyes to a culture that was above me and that I wanted to get to know more,\" he said. For Corona, Chicano rap is a vehicle to tackle issues that matter to him, such as toxic masculinity  or cultural identity.\n\nIn Georgia, Latinos are the third-largest racial or ethnic group, now 1.1 million, according to the 2020 census. Nearly half live in five Atlanta-area counties - Fulton, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett.\n\nA growing number of Latino communities emerged from the state's construction boom to prepare for the 1996 Summer Olympic, which is how Corona's Salvadoran mother and Mexican father met. Latinos also settled in the area after poultry companies recruited workers from Texas, California and northern Mexico, while the Atlanta metro area's flourishing business hub has drawn Latino professionals.\n\nCorona's mother started her first cleaning business in 1999 after working at the Four Seasons Hotel in Atlanta. While there, she started paying attention to little details such as how clean towels were placed in the rooms in neat designs. She applied what she learned selling that first business in 2012 and starting her own commercial cleaning business.\n\n\"We cleaned for Tyler Perry for a time. And now, we're cleaning for studios as well,\" said Corona. He hopes to grow the business and build something he can pass down to his children.\n\nCorona relaxes in his car, drinking a bottle of Topo Chico mineral water from Mexico.

(Piera Moore for NBC News)\n\nCorona learned about the Chicano civil rights movement while studying U.S. history at Georgia Gwinnett College, motivating him to volunteer with groups to register Latino voters in the 2020 election.\n\n\"Seeing that I could potentially help and be a part of that same history is what pushed me,\" Corona said.\n\nHe also joined a coalition advocating for the rights of former immigrant detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center, which is set to close. Irwin County is one of two small, southern rural counties that saw its Latino population almost triple, according to the 2020 census. About 660 Latinos now live there.\n\nThe other county is Charlton County, bordering Florida, where about 2,000 Latinos now live compared to 310 a decade ago. It's also home to another immigration detention facility, the Folkston ICE Processing Center.\n\nFor Corona, a multifaceted man who considers himself \"a conscious Chicano rapper,\" living in Georgia often means cruising on a lowrider car one minute and enjoying a nature hike in Mount Yonah the next.\n\n\"That's Georgia!\" he said.\n\nVerónica Calles Torrez at an entomology lab at North Dakota State University in Fargo on Sept. 10.

(Ann Arbor Miller for NBC News)\n\nTrapping and studying the corn rootworm has been Verónica Calles Torrez's route to exploring North Dakota.\n\nCalles Torrez, 36, originally from La Paz, Bolivia, is an entomologist with the North Dakota State University Agricultural Extension Service in Fargo, whose postdoctorate work revolves around keeping insect pests under control.\n\n\"In North Dakota, there is always a need for any research because they have big agricultural production, so there's always insects eating their crop,\" she said. \"They want to know about it.\"\n\nNorth Dakota had the highest rate of Hispanic population growth of all states - it boomed 148 percent over the last decade.\n\nLatino workers from around the country arrived amid the last decade's oil and construction boom, though it has since declined. Counties in western North Dakota, where the Bakken oil field is, saw much of the Latino growth.\n\nThe county of McKenzie led with a 1,002.2 percent increase, a jump of 1,393 Latinos since 2010.\n\nBut there also was Latino growth in other counties throughout the state. In Cass County, where Fargo is, it rose 105 percent - or 3,167 more Hispanics.\n\nAmazon is building a 1-million-square-foot fulfillment center on former farmland in West Fargo, and Microsoft has its second-largest nonheadquarters campus in Fargo, said Kevin Iverson, North Dakota's state demographer.\n\nThe region's Latino population has jumped 28 percent in 12 states in the last decade.\n\nFrom meat plants in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota to farm fields and oil refineries, Hispanic growth in urban, suburban and rural areas has been a mix of new immigrant arrivals, births and domestic migration.\n\nCalles Torrez grew up on a small Bolivian farm where her family cultivated coffee, mandarins, lemons and other citrus by hand. They grew corn only one year, when the native remnant land they had converted for agricultural use was rich in nutrients. Corn requires nutrient-rich soil and most small Bolivian farms don't use fertilizer, she said.\n\nKnowledgeable about plants, she saw an opportunity in combining that with entomology, the study of insects. In Bolivia, her family dealt with beetle pests and moths that damaged coffee and cocoa plants.\n\nVerónica Calles Torrez holds a European corn borer.

Many approach her, curious about her work, and she uses the opportunity to show them what the pests look like and how they damage their corn.\n\nVerónica Calles Torrez demonstrates how to set up a trap to collect European corn borers near Casselton, N.D.

He knew that Thursday was my day to visit his field,\" she said.\n\nCalles Torrez and her husband, who's finishing his doctorate, have a 7 month old. Whether they will raise their child and set roots in North Dakota boils down to employment opportunities for both after her three-year research program ends.\n\n\"We are going to move wherever we find a job,\" she said.\n\nDesign and development:\n\nPedro Barquinha, Nigel Chiwaya, Joe Murphy and Jiachuan Wu\n\nSuzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC Latino and NBCNews.com\n\nNicole Acevedo is a reporter for NBC News Digital.

Why does it continue to be?\"\n\nHe added that Georgia is among the 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage , which would allow more families to obtain health care access.\n\nThe survey also found that women's reproductive and abortion rights, affordable housing, and climate change are important to Latinos in the state.\n\nThe survey was conducted by BSP Research, a Democratic firm that often conducts polls on Latino voters, in September. Analysts spoke to 500 Latino adults in Georgia in English or Spanish, and the results were weighted using known demographics data, mostly from the U.S. census and the American Community Survey.\n\nWhen GALEO started two decades ago, there were about 10,000 Latinos registered to vote, Gonzalez recalled.\n\nNow, more than 400,000 Latino voters are estimated to be registered to vote, making up about 5% of all voters in Georgia . While small in percentage, they can turn out to be a deciding voting bloc in races won by small margins, or crucial to building coalitions with other minority voters in the state, according to the survey.\n\nLatino voters in Georgia are mostly concentrated in the Atlanta metropolitan area. An overwhelming majority, about 88%, of these registered voters are considered to be \"active,\" meaning they voted in the last two elections, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\n\n\"You add to the mix that there's about 20,000 children of immigrants that become eligible to register to vote every year in Georgia. You add that there is a high percentage of folks that are becoming naturalized citizens every year in Georgia,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nWith a 1.1 million population, Latinos are now the third-largest racial or ethnic group in Georgia, according to the 2020 census.\n\n\"The road to the White House goes straight through Georgia, and Latinos are at the center of it,\" Gonzalez said, adding that a potential exists for Latino voters to be crucial in deciding competitive congressional districts and some legislative districts as well.\n\nDespite Latinos being active voters in the state, Georgia is still \"a hard state to vote in,\" Gonzalez said, emphasizing growing restrictions on absentee ballots and lack of language access.\n\nLatino voters' view on this issue was reflected in the survey, with 84% of those surveyed supporting a new voting rights act ensuring all people can vote without barriers.\n\nThey also voiced overwhelming support, between 80% to 92%, for legislation providing in-state tuition for noncitizens, making housing more affordable and protecting renters' rights.\n\nLatino voters in Georgia have outperformed national Latino voter participation rates in recent elections, according to Gonzalez, especially in counties that were doing significant work in this regard.\n\n\"So it will be decisive come election cycle,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nYet when it comes to voter outreach, the survey found only a third of Latinos reported being contacted by a political party or organization and asked to register or vote.\n\n\"If they don't reach out, it's their own peril,\" Gonzalez said of political parties and campaigns. \"Our community does turn out to vote in strong numbers.\"\n\nNicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

These same groups also advocate for a Latino agenda that has been largely aligned with Democratic Party policies and for candidates and issues of equity. It also can affect their funding for those missions, something that is a continual struggle.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, economic discontent drove Latino men's vote, said Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative for UnidosUS, a national Latino advocacy group whose social welfare arm, UnidosUS Action Fund, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Republicans had a historic night, largely expressed through discontent with the economy. That was the most potent driver,\" Martinez de Castro said in a conference call Tuesday.\n\n\"If there is a mandate here, it's ... to raise wages to bring down food, housing and health care costs, and that is particularly so for Hispanics,\" she said.\n\nAlong with UnidosUS, Latino-focused advocacy groups such as Voto Latino, Somos Votantes, Hispanic Federation and La Brega y Fuerza Fund sponsored a poll of Latino voters. Additional sponsors included other groups focused on immigration, progressive causes or communities of color, such as America's Voice, the American Civil Liberties Union, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Climate Power and First Nations Development Institute.\n\nVoters heard more about addressing those needs from Trump and Republicans, Martinez de Castro said. A lot of times, the candidates choose to be quiet on issues that they think are going to harm them, and \"I think for a good while, Democrats did that on the economy,\" she said.\n\nThe coalition rejected national exit poll findings showing that Trump won the majority of Latino men - 55% - to Harris' 43%. The groups' American Electorate Voter Poll - using a larger Latino sample and additional techniques for polling Hispanics - flipped that outcome, with Harris winning 56% of Latino men to Trump's 43%. BSP Research, the African American Research Collaborative and Harvard University conducted the poll. The Latinos were polled as part of a pool of 9,000 voters surveyed for the American Electorate Voter Poll.\n\nThe coalition said it surveyed 3,750 Latinos in all 50 states and its poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.62 percentage points for Latino voters.\n\n\"The national exit polls are wrong about Latinos and Latino men,\" said Matt Barreto, co-founder of BSP Research and a pollster for Harris. \"They did shift Republican. However, a majority of Latino men continued to vote Democrat.\"\n\nOverall, the NBC News Exit Poll reported Harris capturing 52% of Hispanic voters, compared with 46% for Trump. The coalition's poll found Harris winning Latino voters 62% to 37%. Ahead of the election, NBC News polling showed Harris with a lead of 54% to Trump's 40%.\n\nEdison Research, which conducts national exit polling for NBC News and other news organizations, surveyed 2,750 Latino voters nationally.\n\nRob Farbman, Edison Research executive vice president, told NBC News that he is confident \"the overall story that Hispanics edged to Trump is accurate.\"\n\nEdison Research's exit polling showed a smaller shift to Trump among Latinas too, he said. They voted 60% for Harris, compared with 69% for Joe Biden in 2020, a 9-point shift. (NBC News exit polls show that Latinas voted 38% for Trump this year, compared with 30% in 2020.) Polling that Edison Research did in states with high Hispanic populations also showed a 13-point drop from Biden to Harris with Hispanics.\n\n\"You just look around the country at high-Hispanic counties, the evidence is clear, the shift is real and there's always been this gender gap between Hispanic men and Hispanic women, so it makes sense that Trump may have edged Harris among men, because there's a big shift overall and we expect at least a 10-point gender gap,\" he said.\n\nTrump ended up winning Latino-dominant counties like Miami-Dade in Florida, where Republicans have steadily made gains, as well as several counties in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, including Starr County, which had voted Democratic for 100 years .\n\nNBC News reached out to the Trump campaign on how Latino men voted and Trump's gains with Hispanic voters, but has not received a response.\n\nSince the election, some pundits and analysts have attributed Trump's win to - or in the case of some Harris backers, blamed it on - Latino voters, particularly Latino men.\n\nThe Democratic-leaning Latino groups pushed back on that narrative, citing their own polling.\n\n\"Latino voters were not instrumental in the Trump victory,\" said Gary Segura, president and co-founder of BSP Research, a Democratic polling firm.\n\n\"We have a number that is different from the exit polls, but even if we accept the exit poll numbers, Latinos did not make the difference for Trump in any state,\" Segura said. \"If we take Latinos out in any state, Trump still wins. Latinos did not provide the margin for victory in any state.\"\n\nIn raw numbers, white men had the largest shift from Democratic to Republican, Barreto said. Thirty-seven percent of male participants in exit polling identified as white, while 6% identified as Latino in the Latino groups' poll.\n\nCarlos Odio, co-founder of Equis Research, a Democratic polling firm focused on Latinos that was not part of the coalition groups' poll, said about Latino voters overall in a social media post that \"this looks & sounds like a realignment.\"\n\nThe dominant issues for voters were pocketbook issues of inflation, jobs, the economy, housing and health care costs, Martinez de Castro said, citing the coalition's polling.\n\nFifty-five percent of those polled said Democrats would do a better job addressing the issue most important to them.\n\nThe disconnect between where Latinos land on policy, based on the polling, and their support for Trump is \"an area of strategic reflection for Democrats,\" Martinez de Castro said.\n\nLatino voters were more supportive of a Democratic or progressive agenda, support giving Medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices, support abortion rights and support investing in clean energy, Barreto said the coalition's poll found.\n\nAhead of the election, polls showed increasing support among Latinos for tougher border enforcement following rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border or apprehended.\n\nAccording to the post-election poll by the Democratic-leaning groups, Latino voters supported providing legal status to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. a very long time, including those brought to the U.S. as children. They also back making it easier to bring family members to the U.S. on visas, passing the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump killed and passing a voting rights act that ensures all eligible American citizens can vote without barriers.\n\n\"Let's be clear, Trump does not have a mandate for mass deportations or sending in the military to round up our immigrant neighbors and family members,\" said Vanessa Cardenas, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration advocacy group. \"American voters, and Latino voters in particular, still strongly support legal status for long-settled immigrants.\"\n\nCardenas said their tracking shows that Republicans and their allies spent more than $1 billion on anti-immigrant ads this election cycle.\n\nSuzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Poll: Democrats' advantage with Latino voters continues to shrink\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is leading former President Donald Trump among Latino voters. But that advantage has declined to Democrats' lowest level in the past four presidential cycles, according to a new national NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll .\n\nOverall, the poll shows that Democratic presidential candidate Harris has lost some ground with Latinos at a time when these consequential voters are more likely than the general electorate to cite the economy and the rising cost of living as top priorities. On both of these issues, Latino voters give Trump the advantage, but a majority of them prefer Harris on temperament, competency and having the necessary mental and physical health to be president.\n\nSupport for Harris is at 54% among registered Latino voters, according to the poll, while Trump gets 40% and another 6% say they're unsure or wouldn't vote. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nWhile Harris' 14-point advantage is an improvement from President Joe Biden's standing when he was at the top of the ticket, it is still lower than the past leads Democratic presidential candidates enjoyed in 2012 (by 39 points), 2016 (50 points) and 2020 (36 points), according to NBC's merged polling data from those past cycles.\n\n(Ultimately, Democratic presidential candidates ended up winning Latino voters by 44 points in 2012, 38 points in 2016 and 33 points in 2020, according to the NBC News exit polls in those years.)\n\nSimilarly, Latino voters' preference for which party controls Congress stands at 54% Democrats, 42% Republicans - a much narrower gap than in past years.\n\nDriving the declining support for Democrats in the presidential contest are defections from Latino men, particularly those without college degrees and those under the age of 50, the poll shows. But solid Democratic support from Hispanic women, or Latinas, has helped offset some of that erosion.\n\nSurveying 1,000 Latino voters nationwide in English and Spanish, the poll also finds a striking split on immigration between Latino voters who prioritize a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and preventing discrimination, and those who focus more on border enforcement.\n\nThe latest findings underscore the political diversity of Latinos, which mirror broader divisions seen across the general electorate.\n\n\"Latino voters are incredibly diverse. It can't be overstressed,\" said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll with Republican pollster Micah Roberts and his team at Public Opinion Strategies. \"We are looking at Latino voters rather than a consolidated Latino community.\"\n\nThe NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll asked Latino voters which presidential candidate is better on protecting immigrant rights, securing the border and fighting crime, as well as dealing with abortion issues, the economy and the rising cost of living.\n\nThose surveyed give Harris the advantage on the issues of immigrant rights (a 39-point lead over Trump), abortion (+32) and crime (+5).\n\nTrump receives the advantage on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (9-point lead over Harris) and the economy (+4 points), as well as securing and controlling the border (+13 points). A majority of Latinos in the poll - a combined 54% - say the cost of living and the economy are their top issues.\n\nAfter watching the first presidential debate between Harris and Trump, Victor Gutierrez, 62, of New Jersey said he is \"leaning toward Trump because I believe he has a better grasp on what to do as president\" based on his stances on the economy and border security. For Gutierrez, who is Puerto Rican, Harris came off as too performative during the debate, which he said made him distrustful.\n\nBut according to the poll, when it comes to deciding who possesses the necessary leadership qualities and personal traits to be president, Latinos favor Harris over Trump in all of the seven categories surveyed - including having the right temperament to be president (+28 points), having the necessary mental and physical health (+25 points), being honest and trustworthy (+26 points) and representing change (+21 points).\n\nMichelle García, 49, said she sees Harris as a leader who represents communities that have historically lacked a voice in government - such as women, people of color and immigrants.\n\nGarcía, who is of Peruvian and Puerto Rican descent, spent her Saturday knocking on doors in her community in Maryland to get people to vote for Harris. Some of the main issues driving García's support for Harris are her outspokenness on fixing the economy by closing the nation's growing wealth gap and the fact that Harris is unapologetically in favor of abortion rights, she said.\n\nThe poll also asks Latino voters which political party is better at addressing the Hispanic community's concerns. By a 47%-20% margin, Latino voters prefer the Democratic Party - essentially unchanged from when the poll asked this same question in 2022.\n\nBut the Democratic advantage declines to 11 points, 39%-28%, when Latino voters are asked which party better shares their values - a drop from the Democrats' 19-point edge here two years ago.\n\nIn California, Hispanic voters Matthew Delao, 60, and Fredy Arguello, 50, have historically voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in previous elections. But this year, Delao has decided to vote for Trump, saying he realized he was better off economically during his presidency. Arguello is solidly supporting Harris, because he views her as having the necessary experience and character to lead the country.\n\n\"There's no comparison. You're talking about a former state attorney, someone who has served the public,\" Arguello said about Harris, \"versus someone like Trump, who has no moral standing.\"\n\nBut Delao strongly believes Democrats are \"just giving away so many things to people who shouldn't need it,\" he said, adding that it is important to him that whoever wins the White House \"should concentrate on the United States, concentrate on your own people.\"\n\nTheir divide is representative of how Harris and Trump are splitting the vote evenly among Latino men, with each getting 47% support, the poll shows, versus Harris' 26-point lead among Latinas.\n\nThat's a shift from NBC's merged polling from 2020, when Biden held a 20-point lead over Trump among Latino men. Young Hispanic voters ages 18 to 34 have also moved, supporting Harris over Trump by 10 points (51%-41%), down from Biden's 44-point lead in 2020 (66%-22%).\n\nAmong Latino men, Trump gets more support from men under 50 (they break for him over Harris, 51%-42%) and from those without college degrees (who prefer Trump, 51%-38%), according to this poll.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' stronghold remains with Latinas over 50 (winning them 74%-22%) and Hispanic women with college degrees (61%-35%).\n\nAs a college graduate who worked through school and is also still paying off her student loans, García believes Harris is better equipped to understand \"what it's like to struggle.\"\n\n\"That's a humbling experience. That takes grit. And as a woman, that represents me,\" said García.\n\nAmong religious Latinos, support is split, the poll shows.\n\nCatholic Latinos back Harris over Trump by 20 points (56%-36%) while Trump leads among evangelical Latinos, 64%-28%. Nonreligious Latinos voiced support for Harris by more than 40 points (71%-24%).\n\nWhat also stands out in the poll are Latinos' changing attitudes on immigration, as well as a stark divide on their immigration priorities.\n\nSixty-two percent of Latino voters believe immigration helps more than it hurts, versus 35% who think it hurts more than it helps. That 35% share saying immigration hurts more than it helps is the highest share of Latino voters coming down on that side in two decades of asking the question.\n\nIn addition, when asked to pick their bigger priority, 52% of Latino voters said it was more important to prevent discrimination against immigrants and to create a pathway to citizenship, versus 46% who said it was more important to secure the border and stop immigrants from entering the country illegally.\n\nIn the battle for control of Congress, Democrats hold a double-digit lead in congressional preference - but it's down from past election cycles.\n\nIn this poll, 54% of Latino voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, versus 42% who want Republicans in charge.\n\nThat 12-point lead represents a steady decline from September 2012 (when the Democrats' advantage was 45 points), September 2016 (when it was 34 points), October 2020 (26 points) and September 2022 before that midterm election (21 points).\n\nThe NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC Latino poll of 1,000 registered Latino voters was conducted Sept. 16-23. Fifty-three% of respondents were reached by cellphone, 10% were reached by landline, and 37% were reached text-to-web. Overall, 20% of the interviews were conducted in Spanish. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nNicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.\n\nMark Murray is a senior political editor at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "'Latinos for Trump' rebrands and is set to launch as 'Latino Americans for Trump'\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nDonald Trump's campaign has rebranded its Hispanic outreach, with the former president set to launch \"Latino Americans for Trump\" at a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday.\n\nThe switch from \"Latinos for Trump\" to \"Latino Americans for Trump\" was made to emphasize that Latinos are American, according to Jaime Florez, the Hispanic communications director for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign.\n\n\"It's very important that we all understand that no matter where we're coming from, we're already American,\" Florez said, explaining the name change. \"Whether you're African American, Latino American, Asian American, European American, wherever you come from, we are all American.\"\n\nThe term \"Latino\" is widely considered to be a term that refers to people of Latin American heritage who live in the U.S.\n\nIn explaining the rebranding, Florez said the new campaign name was a collective idea that emerged through meetings and conference calls.\n\n\"We as Latinos want to be treated as what we are. We are already American. This is our country,\" Florez said. \"We came here to stay, we came here to pursue our American dream, we have our families here, and we have our future in the United States. ... Trump gave us the opportunity to feel more united with the idea of working together to make America great again.\"\n\nFlorez said the campaign plans to hold rallies and launch digital, TV and radio ads in both English and Spanish. But he declined to share more specifics, including who will run the effort or how much money it will spend on outreach, saying that some details will be unveiled at Sunday's rally.\n\nTrump's official Latino outreach campaign is off to a late start, less than five months before Election Day. The Republican Party ha s also closed some of its Latino and minority outreach offices.\n\nThe Biden campaign has touted its earlier outreach to Latino voters since last year. In March, the campaign launched its official \"Latinos con Biden,\" investing in ground operations in key battleground states and holding campaign events with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , as well as placing ads in English, Spanish and Spanglish.\n\nWhen asked why the Trump campaign's Latino outreach is launching now, Florez said Trump's trial had complicated the plans they had and put them on hold.\n\nLast week, Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election; his sentencing will be on July 11.\n\nTrump still faces criminal charges in Georgia, Florida and Washington, D.C., but the trials have been delayed and are unlikely to take place until after the Nov. 5 election.\n\nRegarding the closings of the Republican community outreach centers, Florez said those happened because the leases had ended and the Republican National Committee chairperson cannot sign contracts beyond the limit of their tenure, ( Ronna McDaniel resigned as RNC chair in February, after Trump handpicked a new leader).\n\nDanielle Alvarez, a senior adviser for Trump's campaign, said the campaign has \"hundreds of staff and dozens of offices throughout the country to harness the energy and movement President Trump has created, and ultimately deliver victory in November.\" She said offices and staff in the states are not specific to certain voters because issues like the economy impact everyone.\n\nBiden won 63% of the Latino vote in 2020. Trump, however, made inroads with Latino voters in that race compared to 2016, especially in Texas and Florida. According to an April NBC News poll, Latinos favor Biden over Trump, 49% to 39%.\n\nThe April poll also found low approval ratings for Biden among Latinos (40%), though that was up from 35% in January.\n\nTrump has made gains among Latino and other voters in recent polls.\n\nThe economy has been a top concern for Latinos , and two-thirds of Hispanic people surveyed in NBC News' April poll thought the economy had not improved under Biden.\n\nTrump held an event in the Bronx in New York City last week aimed at reaching out to Hispanic and Black voters.\n\nFlorez said that under Trump, Latinos \"had our great hour, our income was better.\"\n\nBiden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement that Biden has delivered \"real results\" for Latinos, citing lower health care costs , job creation that has resulted in record - low Latino unemployment , and \" historic investments leading to Latino small businesses opening at the fastest rate in a decade.\"\n\nFlorez said part of the appeal for Hispanic people who support Trump is his unscripted style.\n\n\"He says the things that we want to hear,\" said Florez. \"He doesn't speak our language, but he says what he thinks.\"\n\nFlorez referred to Trump's speaking style using an expression in Spanish, \"al pan pan y al vino vino,\" which means Trump says it like it is.\n\nTrump's critics, including the Biden campaign, have slammed some of the former president's recent comments, including floating the possibility of imprisoning his political opponents .\n\n\"The American people and the Latino community deserve a president who's focused on delivering solutions for them and their families instead of a wannabe dictator who's focused on himself and ripping away our basic freedoms,\" Chavez Rodriguez said.\n\nCarmen Sesin is a reporter for NBC News based in Miami, Florida.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

After decades in the business, Leguizamo says Hollywood still underrepresents Latino artists and their contributions to American culture are often overlooked.\n\nLeguizamo's talent for playing a range of characters has led to roles from Tybalt in the 1997 film \"Romeo and Juliet\" to Toulouse Lautrec in \"Moulin Rouge!\" in 2001 to a past-his-prime action hero in 2022's \"The Menu.\" He's also the voice of Gor Koresh in the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian,\" Sid the sloth in the \"Ice Age\" movie franchise, and Bruno in Disney's \"Encanto.\"\n\nIn a new MSNBC docuseries , the Emmy-winning actor and producer travels to cultural hotspots in New York, Miami, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Puerto Rico in search of what Leguizamo calls \"exceptionalism\" in the Latino community.\n\n\"There's so much wasted Latin talent in America right now. It breaks my heart to see all these beautiful dreams squandered,\" Leguizamo told NPR's A Martinez.\n\nBreaking through inequalities\n\nAfter pitching stories to production companies for 40 years without a \"green light,\" Leguiazamo says he abandoned an idealistic belief that \"talent will out.\" Instead, he tells Morning Edition that Latino artists must be more \"aggressive\" so their voices break through. And he points to how research for a one-man show on the Latino community's contributions to American history \"made me want to make noise.\"\n\n\"Now I want more. Now I feel more entitled. Now I feel like we deserved. I'm not going to accept no for an answer,\" says Leguizamo.\n\nThe new series, \"Leguizamo Does America,\" features his encounters with artists from dancers and directors to architects and activists.\n\n\"We sit down, we commune with a great Latin meal, and some of us do a little Latin dancing. And we share. We talk about what it's like to be Latinx in America at this time.\"\n\nLeguizamo says inequalities persist and members of the Latino community must be \"much more aggressive.\"\n\nLeguizamo says that \"things are not changing and they need to change now,\" but members of the Latin communities he visited maintain a \"very positive hopeful attitude.\"\n\n\"It's happening. People are listening. They're paying attention. And they realize that there's a void and that it needs to be filled with Latinx.\"\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn working in an underrepresented community in Hollywood\n\nI've been pitching for 40 years to Hollywood and nobody greenlights any script you write. I could write like Shakespeare, but if you had Latin characters and a Latin name, they weren't going to greenlight it no matter how amazingly brilliant it was. And I didn't know that because I was naive and ignorant and I thought America was a meritocracy. You know, I was idealistic back then, thinking that talent would out, but it doesn't.\n\nOn discovering Latino exceptionalism in America\n\nThat gives you confidence. That gave me confidence. It gave me power. It made me much more political. It made me much more outspoken. It made me want to get loud. It made me want to make noise. And that's what we got to do.\n\nOn fighting for more Latino representation in Hollywood\n\nI feel like there's a lot of Latinx out there who are organizing, who are doing grassroots. And you see all these other Latinx people who are creatives who are coming up with Latin stories and want to see more plays. I was just in New York at the Public Theater and I was doing a workshop, but there were like four other Latinx workshops. I had never seen so many Latin creatives in one room, and we all hugged each other and talked and celebrated and high-fived. It's happening. People are listening. They're paying attention. And they realize that there's a void and it needs to be filled with Latinx.\n\nPhil Harrell produced the audio version of the interview.

Phil McCarten/Invision/AP hide caption\n\nYears ago, actor John Leguizamo was helping his then eighth-grade son with a school project and found a lot less Latino history in the textbook than he expected.\n\n\"And so, as super sleuth dad, I got all these books on Latin history on Amazon and went to all the [web] sites - and I was changed,\" Leguizamo says. \"When I found all this information, incredible countless facts and data about our contributions to the making of the U.S. and the world, I ... [went from] feeling small to feeling like a giant.\"\n\nLeguizamo learned that the Maya people likely had flush toilets , that the Inca practiced skull surgery and that thousands of Latino people fought in the American Civil War.\n\n\"These are some of the findings you get,\" Leguizamo says. \"And you're like, 'Wait a minute, what? How is this kept from me? Why is this kept from me?' And then you start to understand that he who writes the history textbooks controls society.\"\n\nIn 2023, Johns Hopkins University released a study finding that 87% of \"key topics in Latino history\" are either underrepresented in textbooks, or left out entirely. Leguizamo is trying to wrest back some of that control with VOCES American Historia , a three-part PBS docuseries he co-created with director Ben DeJesus. The series features interviews and facts that highlight Latino contributions to American history and culture.\n\n\"I wanted [the series] to be like Latino culture was on trial,\" he says. \"I wanted to have evidence to support this, because there's a lot of deniers and they're going to be deniers about our contribution.\"\n\nOn the difference between Hispanic and Latino\n\n\"Hispanic\" means you speak Spanish and, for the most part, Hispanics are from Spain. ... We are all Hispanics because we all speak Spanish, but \"Latino\" means you're not from Spain, means you're from Latin America, means you were colonized. ... We are all Latinos who experience a lot of oppression, slavery, the stealing of our incredible wealth and land wealth and exploitation, for 500 years, that's what Latino means to me.\n\nOn growing up seeing white actors playing Latino roles, like in West Side Story\n\nThey made me feel like I didn't deserve to be the lead in our own stories. I was made to feel that. Now that I'm a grown man, it's not OK. I'm enraged by it. You took an opportunity of a Latin person. Antonio Banderas playing Latinos. He's not Latino. ... We don't have Latino executives who say, \"Look, you're not Latino. Why are you taking Latino roles?\" Or you're [Al] Pacino, you're a white Italian, why are you taking playing a Puerto Rican in Carlito's Way and playing a Cuban in Scarface ? Those should be Latino roles and it should be Latinos playing them. ...\n\nThis Menendez story being done right now [on Netflix about a true story of brothers convicted of killing their parents in 1989] ... It's a Latino story, a horrible Latino story. But there's plenty of Latino actors to play the dad. I love Javier Bardem . I think he's an incredible actor, but he's not Latino. He's a white Spaniard. ... There's tons of Latino actors and talent out there. Put Latinos in Latino roles. Let's not do a disservice. I see so much Latin talent being laid to waste, dreams allowed to desiccate. Use our Latin talent.\n\nOn not getting as many auditions as white actors when he was at NYU\n\nThey were going to five to 10 auditions a day, and I was going to one every five months for a gang member, a drug dealer, a murderer or a janitor. And I realized, wow, I don't have a shot just because I'm Latino. ...\n\nI knew my opportunities were not equal and were not fair. Even if I was as good looking as Brad Pitt - a Latino Brad Pitt - even if I could write like William Shakespeare and Tennessee Williams, or if I could act like Brando, I would not be given that opportunity because I was Latino.\n\nAnd so I tried to find some other venues and I found performance art. And then I started creating my first show, Mambo Mouth . I would do all these characters and I became a celebrity in those venues. ... When Latin audiences found me, my God, it was church. Because they would be crying and screaming and laughing, and it was wild. And that fueled me. That fueled me for my four decades in the business.\n\nOn why some Latino immigrants want a stricter border\n\nWe're doing the work. We're feeding America. We're doing all that labor that nobody wants. America does not function without Latino immigrants. It just doesn't. It never has and never will.\n\nWe're doing the work. We're feeding America. We're doing all that labor that nobody wants. America does not function without Latino immigrants. It just doesn't. It never has and never will.\n\nJohn Leguizamo\n\nSome immigrants feel ... empowered by going against other immigrants, and I guess they feel more American or less \"othered\" if they attack others. I think there's a syndrome of that. And some immigrants are afraid of immigrants taking their jobs because those are the jobs that they might take. ... I mean, the jobs Latinos are doing, nobody wants. That's why they're doing it. And that's why we need immigrants, because immigrants fuel America. They're doing the essential labor. The Mexican immigrants and the Central American immigrants that died on the Maryland bridge, they were doing that infrastructure work. We built Katrina back after Hurricane Katrina. We built Louisiana back. ... We're doing the work. We're feeding America. We're doing all that labor that nobody wants. America does not function without Latino immigrants. It just doesn't.

Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., is among the members using Spanglish - meaning a mix of English and Spanish - to communicate with constituents. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption\n\nRep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., is among the members using Spanglish - meaning a mix of English and Spanish - to communicate with constituents.\n\nAs the youngest candidate elected to Congress last year , Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost says Spanglish was key in connecting with voters.\n\n\"You might be nervous doing a full ad in Spanish and maybe sounding, you know, like a 'gringo' or whatever, and you don't want to sound that way,\" Frost, 27, told NPR recently from his Capitol Hill office.\n\nHowever, Spanglish - switching back and forth between Spanish and English, sometimes in the same sentence - may be a more effective way to \"speak with all your constituents,\" he added.\n\nFrost is part of new, groundbreaking project this election cycle for Latino House Democrats who today are launching a campaign war room using Spanish and Spanglish to boost candidates in key congressional races. In an exclusive preview for NPR, leaders of the BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the effort will be backed by an initial six-figure budget.\n\nThe campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is calling the new effort \"Our Lucha War Room,\" or their fight for Latinos and boosting their  representation in Congress.\n\n\"This is the first war room that has ever had Latinos in mind from the very beginning and at its very core,\" said Victoria McGroary, executive director of BOLD PAC . \"So every single thing that we have done in designing this war room is with the lens of: How can we communicate this best to a Latino audience?\"\n\nFlorida Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, an endorsed BOLD PAC candidate running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott this cycle, has battled misinformation in her state for years.\n\nThat included testimony before members of Congress about its spread on Spanish language media.\n\nShe says the new \"Lucha\" war room will be a boost in her race.\n\n\"This is more critical than ever as we continue to see disinformation being spread and targeted to Latinos,\" she said. \"And we know that there are going to be over 35 million Latinos that are eligible to vote in these November elections.\"\n\nThe war room will target Senate races in Florida, as well as the battleground state of Arizona, where BOLD PAC endorsed Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego. The Arizona race - where Gallego could face off against former Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake - could decide control of the Senate in 2025.\n\nAlready, \"Lucha\" war room launched an ad targeting Lake and her \"extremist\" views .\n\nIn Arizona, \"Our Lucha War Room,\" which is backed by BOLD PAC, has launched its first ad targeting former GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who could face off against Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego for a U.S. Senate seat.\n\nBOLD PAC leaders say this new effort will expand on test cases led by congressional candidates like Frost, who released a Spanglish ad in his last campaign.\n\n\"My abuela,\" he says in the ad referring to his grandmother, \"taught me early on to always look out for my community.\"\n\nFlorida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost is among pioneering members in Congress using Spanglish to connect with Latino voters, releasing this ad during his first campaign.\n\nLast year, a Pew Research study found that Spanglish is widespread among Latinos . More than a majority, 63%, now use the combination of Spanish and English.\n\nWith this in mind, the \"Lucha\" war room is part of Latino Democrats' larger mission to defeat Republican candidates, and especially the party's more extreme candidates.\n\nThey'll start with a focus on a dozen key races around the country with ads on YouTube and other social media platforms. The races include two for U.S. Senate and 10 swing House congressional districts in West Coast states such as California, as well as in Colorado, Nebraska and Texas.\n\nMcGroary said the effort is designed to reach every generation of Latino in the same household.\n\n\"We want to make sure that all of the content that we are creating right down to the logo and the name,\" she says, \"that every piece of what we are doing is designed with the Latino audience in mind.\"\n\nCalifornia Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sánchez, who is the chairwoman for BOLD PAC, says the war room is poised to quickly respond to misinformation and disinformation.\n\nThe BOLD PAC is launching the Lucha War Room under the direction of the group's first entirely female leadership team. Catie Dull/NPR hide caption\n\nThe BOLD PAC is launching the Lucha War Room under the direction of the group's first entirely female leadership team.\n\nShe points to the recent, fake robocalls impersonating President Biden in the New Hampshire primaries as an example of what would trigger the Lucha war room into action.\n\n\"We think this is long overdue. We're making a sizable investment in this,\" Sánchez told NPR. \"And that's just a down payment on, you know, further investment and ... making sure that voters have accurate information.\"\n\nMcGroary, the BOLD PAC executive director, also notes it would be historic if Latinos were elected in either the Arizona or Florida Senate races.\n\n\"It is critically important that Democrats defend the Senate this cycle,\" she says. Also, \"Arizona has never had a Latino senator. ... In Florida, they have never had a Latina senator.\"\n\nBack at Congressman Frost's office, he remembers all of the young Latinos who reached out after that first ad featuring Spanglish.\n\n\"Young Latinos who are maybe first- or second-generation Americans ... oftentimes use Spanglish,\" he said. And \"after we put out that ad, we received a lot of texts and DMs from like young Latinos who ... said, 'I love that ad' ... so I think that we'll see a lot more Spanglish ads going on across the country.\"\n\nDestinee Adams produced the audio for this piece.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The First Latino 'Bachelor' Makes His Debut\n\nBy\n\nShereen Marisol Meraji\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis, a contestant on a past season of \"The Bachelorette,\" stars in the 18th season of \"The Bachelor.\" Craig Sjodin/AP hide caption\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis, a contestant on a past season of \"The Bachelorette,\" stars in the 18th season of \"The Bachelor.\"\n\nThe Bachelor is back again. Yep - the ABC reality show where a single guy gets to choose a potential wife from a couple dozen women. This season's single guy is Latino. He's the first bachelor-of-color in the show's 11 year history.\n\nAnd ABC's is really hyping it up, calling this month Juan-uary after the new star: Juan Pablo Galavis. Promos for the show say he's 'Juan-in-a-million' and 'Juan-derful.' Alex Nogales, President and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition (a group working to put more Latinos in front of and behind the camera), says \"trite\" and \"frivolous\" are better words to describe the Bachelor and Bachelorette franchise. But regardless, he says, Latinos should be a part of it. \"How we are perceived is going to always be the way that we're treated. If we're not even visible, it's even worse.\"\n\nIt's not hyperbole to say that people of color have been completely sidelined on both The Bachelor and Bachelorette . A couple of years ago Entertainment Weekly asked the show's creator Mike Fleiss if there would ever be a non-white Bachelor or Bachelorette :\n\nI think Ashley [Hebert] is 1/16 th Cherokee Indian, but I cannot confirm. But that is my suspicion! We really tried but sometimes we feel guilty of tokenism. Oh, we have to wedge African-American chicks in there! We always want to cast for ethnic diversity, it's just that for whatever reason, they don't come forward. I wish they would.\n\nABC faced a class action suit, last year, led by two African-American men who auditioned and claimed they were treated unfairly based on race. The suit was eventually dismissed.\n\nAt first glance, Juan Pablo Galavis does look like every other Bachelor. \"He's a very good-looking, athletically built and engaging fellow who happens to be very light-complected,\" says Nogales.\n\nCritics of the choice vocal in the blogosphere and on social media said he's just another white guy.\n\nMichelle Herrera Mulligan, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan for Latinas , says it's more nuanced than that. \"I could see why people would take issue with the notion that he's the first non-white bachelor to be on there but he's the first non-sort-of-quote-unquote 'culturally white' bachelor to be on there.\"\n\nHerrera Mulligan says ABC made an interesting choice. Yeah, Galavis may look white, but he's bilingual and bicultural. Born here, but raised in Venezuela, he played soccer professionally, speaks with an accent and has a daughter, a nod to the importance of family in Latino culture.\n\nIn part one of the season premiere, there was a scene with Galavis's extended family hanging out together and eating traditional Venezuelan food. Galavis was definitely one of the lightest in the bunch, a reminder that within Latino families there is a range in color.\n\nAlex Nogales from the National Hispanic Media Coalition says ABC IS taking a step in the right direction with Juan Pablo Galavis, but he adds that the great majority of Latinos in the United States are Mexican. And he says a majority of those Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans are mestizos, mixed primarily with indigenous and Spanish blood. They're brown, he says, and deserve to be Bachelors and Bachelorettes too.\n\n\"They gotta include everybody, African Americans as well as Latinos of every coloration. And forget this b------- of 'We can't find any,' \" says Nogales. \"They're there!\"\n\nDisparities in how darker-skinned Latinos and African Americans are treated in the United States have real consequences. NPR correspondent Shankar Vedantam wrote about this in a 2010 New York Times piece :\n\nConsider: Lighter-skinned Latinos in the United States make $5,000 more on average than darker-skinned Latinos. The education test-score gap between light-skinned and dark-skinned African-Americans is nearly as large as the gap between whites and blacks.\n\nThe Harvard neuroscientist Allen Counter has found that in Arizona, California and Texas, hundreds of Mexican-American women have suffered mercury poisoning as a result of the use of skin-whitening creams.\n\nPutting aside the dispute of whether the choice of Galavis is a real step forward for Latinos and other people of color, Nogales says he hopes ABC won't end this season of The Bachelor and go back to business as usual. He's expecting more than a Juan-Off.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Immigrants' Resentment Over New Arrivals Helped Boost Trump's Popularity With Latino Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAt first, she didn't think much about the Nicaraguan asylum-seekers who began moving into town a few years ago. Rosa was an immigrant too, one of the many undocumented Mexican immigrants who'd settled nearly 30 years ago in Whitewater, a small university town in southeast Wisconsin.\n\nSome of the Nicaraguans had found housing in Rosa's neighborhood, a trailer park at the edge of town. They sent their children to the same public schools. And they got jobs in the same factories and food-processing facilities that employed many of Rosa's friends and relatives.\n\nThen Rosa realized that many of the newcomers with ongoing asylum cases could apply for work permits and driver's licenses - state and federal privileges that are unavailable to undocumented immigrants. Rosa's feelings of indifference turned to frustration and resentment.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" said Rosa, who works as a janitor. \"Those of us who have been here for years get nothing.\"\n\nHer anger is largely directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for failing to produce meaningful reforms to the immigration system that could benefit people like her. In our reporting on the new effects of immigration , ProPublica interviewed dozens of long-established Latino immigrants and their U.S.-born relatives in cities like Denver and Chicago and in small towns along the Texas border. Over and over, they spoke of feeling resentment as they watched the government ease the transition of large numbers of asylum-seekers into the U.S. by giving them access to work permits and IDs, and in some cities spending millions of dollars to provide them with food and shelter.\n\nIt's one of the reasons so many Latino voters chose Donald Trump this election, giving him what appears to be Republicans' biggest win in a presidential race since exit polls began tracking this data. Latinos' increased support for Trump - who says he could use the military to execute his plans for mass deportations - defied conventional wisdom, disrupting long-held assumptions about loyalties to the Democratic Party. The shift could give Republicans reason to cater to Latinos to keep them in the party's fold.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump singled out Whitewater after the police chief wrote a letter to Biden asking for help responding to the needs of the new Nicaraguan arrivals. While some residents were put off by Trump's rhetoric about the city being destroyed by immigrants, it resonated with many of the longtime Mexican-immigrant residents we interviewed. They said they think the newcomers have unfairly received benefits that they never got when they arrived illegally decades ago - and that many still don't have today.\n\nAmong those residents is one of Rosa's friends and neighbors who asked to be identified by one of her surnames, Valadez, because she is undocumented and fears deportation. A single mother who cleans houses and buildings for a living, Valadez makes extra money on the side by driving immigrants who don't have cars to and from work and to run errands. It's a risky side hustle, though, because she's frequently been pulled over and ticketed by police for driving without a license, costing her thousands of dollars in fines.\n\nOne day two summers ago, one of her sons found a small purse at a carnival in town. Inside they found a Wisconsin driver's license, a work permit issued to a Nicaraguan woman and $300 in cash. Seeing the contents filled Valadez with bitterness. She asked her son to turn in the purse to the police but kept the $300. \"I have been here for 21 years,\" she said. \"I have five children who are U.S. citizens. And I can't get a work permit or a driver's license.\"\n\nWhen she told that story to Rosa one afternoon this spring, her friend nodded emphatically in approval. Rosa, like Valadez, couldn't vote. But two of Rosa's U.S.-born children could, and they cast ballots for Trump. One of Rosa's sons even drives a car with a bumper sticker that says \"Let's Go Brandon\" - a popular anti-Biden slogan.\n\nRosa said she is glad her children voted for Trump. She's not too worried about deportation, although she asked to be identified solely by her first name to reduce the risk. She believes Trump wants to deport criminals, not people like her who crossed the border undetected in the 1990s but haven't gotten in trouble with the law. \"They know who has been behaving well and who hasn't been,\" she said.\n\nIn the months leading up to the presidential election, numerous polls picked up on the kinds of frustrations felt by Rosa and her family. Those polls indicated that many voters considered immigration one of the most pressing challenges facing the country and that they were disappointed in the Biden administration's record.\n\nBiden had come into office in 2021 promising a more humane approach to immigration after four years of more restrictive policies during the first Trump administration. But record numbers of immigrants who were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border began to overwhelm the system. While the Biden administration avoided talking about the border situation like a crisis, the way Trump and the GOP had, outspoken critics like Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amplified the message that things at the border were out of control while he arranged to bus thousands of immigrants to Democrat-controlled big cities around the country. In Whitewater, hundreds of Nicaraguans arrived on their own to fill jobs in local factories, and many of them drove to work without licenses, putting a strain on the small local police department with only one Spanish-speaking officer.\n\nWhile the Biden administration kept a Trump expulsion policy in place for three years, it also created temporary parole programs and an app to allow asylum-seekers to make appointments to cross the border. The result was that hundreds of thousands more immigrants were allowed to come into the country and apply for work permits, but the efforts didn't assuage the administration's critics on the right or left. Meanwhile, moves to benefit undocumented workers who were already in the country were less publicized, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nConchita Cruz, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, which serves a network of around 1 million asylum-seekers across the country, said that because of either court challenges or processing backlogs, Biden wasn't able to deliver on many of his promises to make it easier for immigrants who've lived in this country for years to regularize their status.\n\n\"Policies meant to help immigrants have not always materialized,\" she said.\n\nCruz said that while the administration extended the duration of work permits for some employment categories, backlogs have hampered the quick processing of those extensions. As of September, there were about 1.2 million pending work permit applications, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, with many pending for six months or more. USCIS said the agency has taken steps to reduce backlogs while processing a record number of applications.\n\nBiden's attempts to push for broad immigration reform in Congress, including a proposal his administration sent on his first day in office, went nowhere. Earlier this year, in an effort to prevent a political win for Biden before the election, Trump pressured Republicans to kill bipartisan legislation that would have increased border security.\n\nCamila Chávez, the executive director of the Dolores Huerta Foundation in Bakersfield, California, said Democrats failed to combat misinformation and turn out Latino voters. She recalled meeting one young Latina Trump supporter while she knocked on voters' doors with the foundation's sister political action organization. The woman told her she was concerned that the new immigrant arrivals were bringing crime and cartel activity - and potentially were a threat to her own family's safety.\n\n\"That's our charge as organizations, to make sure that we are in the community and educating folks on how government works and to not vote against our own self-interests. Which is what's happening now,\" said Chávez, who is the daughter of famed farmworker advocate Dolores Huerta and a niece of Cesar Chávez.\n\nTrump has made clear he intends to deliver on his deportation promises, though the details of how he'll do it and who will be most affected remain unclear. The last time Trump was elected, he moved quickly to issue an executive order that said no \" classes or categories \" of people who were in the country illegally could be exempt from enforcement. Tom Homan, who Trump has picked to serve as his \"border czar,\" said during a recent interview with Fox & Friends that immigrants who were deemed to be a threat to public safety or national security would be a priority under a new administration. But he said immigrants with outstanding deportation orders will also be possible targets and that there will be raids at workplaces with large numbers of undocumented workers.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican strategist, said it's wishful thinking to believe Trump will give any special treatment to undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. for a long time. But he's heard that sentiment among Latino voters in focus groups.\n\n\"They believe that they are playing by the rules and that they will be rewarded for it,\" Madrid said. \"Republicans have never been serious about legal migration, let alone illegal migration. They're allowing themselves to believe that for no good reason.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's growing appeal to Latino voters was especially noticeable in places like Del Rio, a Texas border town. As ProPublica previously reported, Trump flipped the county where Del Rio sits from blue to red in 2020 and won it this year with 63% of the vote .\n\nSergio Garza Castillo, a Mexican immigrant who owns a gas station and convenience store in Del Rio, illustrates that political shift. Garza Castillo said he came to the U.S. legally as a teenager in the 1980s after his father, a U.S. citizen, petitioned and waited for more than a decade to bring his family across the border.\n\nEver since Garza Castillo became a U.S. citizen in 2000, he has tended to vote for Democrats, believing in their promise of immigration reform that could lead to more pathways to citizenship for long-established undocumented immigrants, including many of his friends and acquaintances.\n\nBut the Democrats \"promised and they never delivered,\" Garza Castillo said. \"They didn't normalize the status of the people who were already here, but instead they let in many migrants who didn't come in the correct way.\" He believes asylum-seekers should have to wait outside the country like he did.\n\nRead More\n\nHe said he began to turn away from the Democrats in September 2021, when nearly 20,000 mostly Haitian immigrants seeking asylum waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico and camped out under the city's international bridge near Garza Castillo's gas station. Federal authorities had instructed the immigrants to wait there to be processed; some remained there for weeks, sleeping under tarps and blankets with little access to water and food. Garza Castillo said he and other business owners lost money when the federal government shut down the international bridge, an economic engine for Del Rio.\n\nSome of the Haitian migrants were eventually deported; others were allowed into the U.S. to pursue asylum claims and given notices to appear in court in a backlogged immigration system that can take years to resolve a case. \"That to me is offensive for those who have been living here for more than 10 years and haven't been able to adjust their status,\" Garza Castillo said.\n\nHe hopes Trump seizes on the opportunity to expand support from Latino voters by creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who've been here for years. \"If he does that,\" he said, \"I think the Republican Party will be strong here for a long time.\"\n\nAnjeanette Damon , Nicole Foy , Perla Trevizo and Gerardo del Valle contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI report on immigration and labor, and I am based in Chicago.\n\nMica Rosenberg is an investigative reporter on ProPublica's national desk focusing on immigration.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Immigrants' Resentment Over New Arrivals Helped Boost Trump's Popularity With Latino Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAt first, she didn't think much about the Nicaraguan asylum-seekers who began moving into town a few years ago. Rosa was an immigrant too, one of the many undocumented Mexican immigrants who'd settled nearly 30 years ago in Whitewater, a small university town in southeast Wisconsin.\n\nSome of the Nicaraguans had found housing in Rosa's neighborhood, a trailer park at the edge of town. They sent their children to the same public schools. And they got jobs in the same factories and food-processing facilities that employed many of Rosa's friends and relatives.\n\nThen Rosa realized that many of the newcomers with ongoing asylum cases could apply for work permits and driver's licenses - state and federal privileges that are unavailable to undocumented immigrants. Rosa's feelings of indifference turned to frustration and resentment.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" said Rosa, who works as a janitor. \"Those of us who have been here for years get nothing.\"\n\nHer anger is largely directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for failing to produce meaningful reforms to the immigration system that could benefit people like her. In our reporting on the new effects of immigration , ProPublica interviewed dozens of long-established Latino immigrants and their U.S.-born relatives in cities like Denver and Chicago and in small towns along the Texas border. Over and over, they spoke of feeling resentment as they watched the government ease the transition of large numbers of asylum-seekers into the U.S. by giving them access to work permits and IDs, and in some cities spending millions of dollars to provide them with food and shelter.\n\nIt's one of the reasons so many Latino voters chose Donald Trump this election, giving him what appears to be Republicans' biggest win in a presidential race since exit polls began tracking this data. Latinos' increased support for Trump - who says he could use the military to execute his plans for mass deportations - defied conventional wisdom, disrupting long-held assumptions about loyalties to the Democratic Party. The shift could give Republicans reason to cater to Latinos to keep them in the party's fold.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump singled out Whitewater after the police chief wrote a letter to Biden asking for help responding to the needs of the new Nicaraguan arrivals. While some residents were put off by Trump's rhetoric about the city being destroyed by immigrants, it resonated with many of the longtime Mexican-immigrant residents we interviewed. They said they think the newcomers have unfairly received benefits that they never got when they arrived illegally decades ago - and that many still don't have today.\n\nAmong those residents is one of Rosa's friends and neighbors who asked to be identified by one of her surnames, Valadez, because she is undocumented and fears deportation. A single mother who cleans houses and buildings for a living, Valadez makes extra money on the side by driving immigrants who don't have cars to and from work and to run errands. It's a risky side hustle, though, because she's frequently been pulled over and ticketed by police for driving without a license, costing her thousands of dollars in fines.\n\nOne day two summers ago, one of her sons found a small purse at a carnival in town. Inside they found a Wisconsin driver's license, a work permit issued to a Nicaraguan woman and $300 in cash. Seeing the contents filled Valadez with bitterness. She asked her son to turn in the purse to the police but kept the $300. \"I have been here for 21 years,\" she said. \"I have five children who are U.S. citizens. And I can't get a work permit or a driver's license.\"\n\nWhen she told that story to Rosa one afternoon this spring, her friend nodded emphatically in approval. Rosa, like Valadez, couldn't vote. But two of Rosa's U.S.-born children could, and they cast ballots for Trump.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: A Closer Look\n\nThis election once again showed the need for more distinct voices in newsrooms. ProPublica and Texas Tribune reporter Perla Trevizo explains why newsrooms must comprise and engage the communities they cover - and not just before an election.\n\nby Perla Trevizo\n\nExamining the News\n\nLeer en español.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was co-published with the Houston Chronicle.\n\nIn 2016, when it became clear that Donald Trump would become president, media outlets across the U.S. were blindsided by the results. They pledged to do better representing the larger communities that make up America. That included conservatives, those in rural areas (a complex group on its own) and, yes, Latinos.\n\nFour years later, though Trump did not win reelection, former Vice President Joe Biden's narrower margin of victory in spite of polls predicting a landslide have media outlets asking similar questions all over again. The increased percentage of Latino voters for Trump in particular caught many off guard. How could pollsters get it wrong again? And is the media, and a lack of diversity in newsrooms, part of the problem?\n\nLast time around, a national publication made a show of announcing it was expanding its coverage teams and hiring people that brought those unique perspectives. I applied for a spot to cover immigration even though I knew that coming from a smaller newspaper, it would be a long shot. Still, if it was serious about diversifying the newsroom, I thought, I had a chance.\n\nI'm a first-generation immigrant, born in Ciudad Juárez and raised across the border in El Paso, in a middle-class family. While my dad had been an engineer in Mexico, he became a life insurance salesman when we emigrated, then a truck driver, something he is still doing in his mid-60s. There's no 401(k) for him, there's no deep savings account or a fully paid mortgage.\n\nWhen I applied for the position, I had been an immigration reporter for about a decade; I had experience writing about immigrants and refugees from a dozen countries. Spoiler alert, I didn't get the job, neither did another person of color.\n\nIt didn't have to be me, by any means, but we've made so little progress in diversifying our newsrooms. Newsrooms are a window into America. Journalists have the great power - and responsibility - to choose whose voices we represent and how. We are part, or should be, of the communities we cover.\n\nWhile Hispanics are credited with helping Biden in Arizona, Trump made significant gains in the Hispanic vote in Florida and Texas. That jump was particularly stark in South Texas, where Biden won in most counties but by a much narrower margin than Hillary Clinton did four years ago.\n\nAs a country, we continue to be surprised that Latinos are not a monolithic group and that not all vote for Democrats. Since President Richard Nixon's 1972 reelection, Republican candidates have pretty consistently received one-quarter to one-third of the Hispanic vote, according to Geraldo L. Cadava , an associate professor at Northwestern University who wrote a book on the topic.\n\nThe reasons that Latinos voted for Trump in Florida are different from those who did so in Texas. For Cuban Americans and Venezuelans, among other issues, it was the perceived threat of \"socialism\" from Biden, while for Mexican Americans in Texas the pull was in part secure borders and support for law enforcement.\n\nThe press, pundits and politicians at the national level still see immigration as the key issue for Latinos. If you want to win \"their\" vote, talk about Dreamers, talk about citizenship, talk about the border. But just as for any other group, there are so many other issues that are important. More than 18% of the U.S. population is Hispanic - 40% in Texas - yet we represent roughly 7% of the newsroom workforce, according to the News Leaders 2019 Diversity Survey. Latinos account for 10% of the staff at ProPublica, 21% at The Texas Tribune and 30% of our joint newsroom partnership.\n\nWhen trying to make a point about the diversity within this community, I often turn to my family. My grandfather was born in New Mexico to a father who worked at a smelter. At some point his family went back to Mexico, where my grandfather grew up, got married and had kids.\n\nEventually, he returned to the U.S. for work. The older siblings - including my mom - didn't fully learn English, prefer to watch Telemundo and identify more as Mexican than American. The younger siblings, though, graduated from high school in El Paso, speak Spanglish and have a split identity between both countries.\n\nAnd their children? Well, out of all the cousins very few of us can still communicate fluently in Spanish, and even fewer of us can read and write in our parents' native tongue. Most grew up with \"Sesame Street\" and not \"El Chavo del Ocho\" and prefer Flaming Hot Cheetos instead of Churrumais. They have few ties to their parents' country.\n\nWithin the family, there are small-business owners, a nurse, mechanics, military members - even a journalist. There are those who support Trump, those who are religious and conservative, those who are apathetic and disillusioned. There are those who sympathize with immigrants but feel \"we\" have our own problems here, and those for whom the border should be an imaginary line. Abortion, health care and equal rights are all defining issues - just like for the rest of America.\n\nThat's what we fail to understand. That even within one group, such as Mexican Americans, there can be a wide range of views, of beliefs, of priorities. Growing up in El Paso, immigration or the Border Patrol didn't control my life, even when you could see Juárez from our backyard. That's not what my parents talked about at the kitchen table. They worried about paying the mortgage and making sure we graduated.\n\nWhen I became a border reporter, I strived to go beyond the important but well-covered stories of migrant deaths in the desert, about unauthorized migration and Border Patrol shootings. It was hard, and I didn't always succeed. In this country, immigration is often covered as a problem, as a wave of people coming across, an invasion. The story of assimilation or divergent views and experiences among immigrant families is much tougher to tell and to sell, but they are now more important than ever.\n\nBy slashing teams that gather critical data, the administration has left the federal government with no way of understanding if policies are working - and created a black hole of information whose consequences could ripple out for decades.\n\nThese areas, these communities, are vibrant places with issues including limited access to well-paying jobs, quality education, health care and civic engagement. But that's not the story of the border we are generally exposed to.\n\nMy hope is that once again, as journalists reflect on what we did well and what we can improve on, we remember that immigrants, border communities and people of color are not homogenous and we must engage them as readers, as voters, as residents, day in and day out, not just before an election.\n\nOnly then will we, as a country, have a better understanding of who we are and what we represent. Only then will we stop covering immigrants, Latinos, rural communities, conservatives, Native Americans as something more than \"us\" versus \"them.\" Only then, will it be \"we.\"\n\nFiled under:\n\nPerla Trevizo\n\nI'm a reporter with the ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative unit and focus on border and immigration issues.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Chicago's \"Race-Neutral\" Traffic Cameras Ticket Black and Latino Drivers the Most\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen then-Mayor Richard M. Daley ushered in Chicago's red-light cameras nearly two decades ago, he said they would help the city curb dangerous driving. \"This is all about safety, safety of pedestrians, safety of other drivers, passengers, everyone,\" he said.\n\nHis successors echoed those sentiments as they expanded camera enforcement. \"My goal is only one thing, the safety of our kids,\" Rahm Emanuel said in 2011, as he lobbied for the introduction of speed cameras. And in 2020, Lori Lightfoot assured residents her expansion of the program was \"about making sure that we keep communities safe.\"\n\nBut for all of their safety benefits, the hundreds of cameras that dot the city - and generate tens of millions of dollars a year for City Hall - have come at a steep cost for motorists from the city's Black and Latino neighborhoods. A ProPublica analysis of millions of citations found that households in majority Black and Hispanic ZIP codes received tickets at around twice the rate of those in white areas between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe consequences have been especially punishing in Black neighborhoods, which have been hit with more than half a billion dollars in penalties over the last 15 years, contributing to thousands of vehicle impoundments, driver's license suspensions and bankruptcies, according to ProPublica's analysis.\n\n\"We felt the brunt of it the way white people didn't,\" said Olatunji Oboi Reed, a longtime activist for racial equity in transportation in Chicago who has received a handful of camera tickets over the years. \"Fortunately, I've always been in a situation where I can survive financially, unlike many Black and brown people in the city; one ticket is throwing their whole finances in a hurricane.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic widened the ticketing disparities. Black and Latino workers have been far less likely than others to have jobs that allow them to work remotely, forcing them into their vehicles more often. In 2020, ProPublica found, the ticketing rate for households in majority-Black ZIP codes jumped to more than three times that of households in majority-white areas. For households in majority-Hispanic ZIP codes, there was an increase, but it was much smaller.\n\nSimilar racial and income disparities in camera ticketing have been documented elsewhere. In Rochester, New York, officials eliminated the city's red-light camera program in 2016 in part because motorists from low-income neighborhoods received the most tickets and the financial harm outweighed any safety benefits. Miami ended its program in 2017 amid complaints from low-income residents who felt unfairly burdened by the fines. And in Washington, D.C., racial justice advocates are researching the city's camera-ticketing program after a local think tank in 2018 and The Washington Post last year found that cameras in Black neighborhoods issued a disproportionate share of tickets there.\n\nA weekly newsletter about wrongdoing in America\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nAlthough some cities have eliminated their camera programs, automated enforcement has been gaining support elsewhere in the aftermath of the nation's racial reckoning following the death of George Floyd in 2020 at the hands of police. From California to Virginia , citizens groups, safety organizations , elected officials and others are pointing to cameras as a \"race-neutral\" alternative to potentially biased - and, for many Black men, fatal - police traffic stops.\n\nAnd more funding for cameras may be coming: The federal infrastructure bill passed last fall allows states to spend federal dollars on traffic cameras in work and school zones.\n\nIn Chicago, officials have known of disparities since at least April 2020, when a pair of professors at the University of Illinois Chicago shared initial research showing that cameras send the most tickets to predominantly Black ZIP codes. The city then hired them to study the issue further.\n\nSix months later, Lightfoot - who campaigned in part on ending what she called the city's \"addiction\" to fines and fees - proposed that Chicago expand camera ticketing by lowering the speeds at which cameras will issue citations. Lightfoot called it a public safety measure, especially in light of a spike in traffic fatalities during the pandemic, but many observers called it a money grab. The City Council approved the measure as part of the 2021 annual budget.\n\nAfter the change went into effect last March, racial disparities persisted, ProPublica found.\n\nWhen asked why the city expanded the program despite knowing of the racial disparities, Dan Lurie, Lightfoot's policy chief, said the administration saw that traffic fatalities were \"at epidemic levels\" and that was a \"deep concern\" to the mayor. \"We feel strongly,\" he said, \"that cameras are a tool in the toolkit to help alleviate that.\"\n\nThe city is not considering eliminating the cameras or shrinking the program, though Lurie said the administration would \"evaluate\" cameras at locations where there's evidence they do not reduce crashes.\n\nA summary of the UIC research provided to ProPublica last week confirmed the racial disparities in red-light and speed-camera ticketing and found that most of the speed cameras improve safety.\n\nCity officials said they are trying to mitigate the financial harm caused by camera tickets. They pointed to a pilot program that halves the costs of fines and allows for some debt forgiveness for low-income residents. That initiative, which was announced last year with no mention of the racial inequities baked into the camera program, is scheduled to start by the end of March.\n\nLurie said the administration has been grappling with the \"twin challenges\" of improving traffic safety while \"very intentionally ensuring that the burdens of fines and fees as a result of those kinds of efforts do not fall disproportionately on Black and brown residents.\"\n\nThe irony is that some of the factors that contribute to ticketing disparities, such as wider streets and lack of sidewalks in low-income communities of color, also make those neighborhoods more dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists and even motorists. According to a 2017 city report, Black Chicagoans are killed in traffic crashes at twice the rate of white residents.\n\nThe city's latest transportation plan , which has a focus on racial equity, lays out a number of projects, such as improving crosswalks and building more bike lanes. City officials also said they plan to install more flashing signs that show drivers how fast they're going - devices known to help reduce speeds.\n\nLurie acknowledged that the best way to reduce traffic fatalities is to fix the underlying road infrastructure that contributes to unsafe driving. That way, he said, \"Pedestrians are safer, you're safer and no one's getting a fine. That's the ideal outcome here. We are dealing with, in many ways, after-the-fact consequences of streets that need to be rethought and redesigned.\"\n\nChicago's automated camera program began in 2003, after a 30-day \"experiment\" on opposite ends of Western Avenue recorded some 4,500 red-light violations. Over the next decade, the Daley administration installed cameras at dozens of intersections around the city.\n\nEmanuel expanded the program further in 2013 to include speed cameras.\n\nThe Lightfoot-era expansion happened, fundamentally, through lowering the speed limit threshold for tickets, not by adding more cameras.\n\nToday, motorists are monitored by cameras at close to 300 locations around the city, making Chicago's automated traffic enforcement program one of the largest in the country. Both red-light and speed cameras are distributed roughly evenly among the city's Black, Latino and white neighborhoods.\n\nThe cameras capture images of a vehicle's license plate as well as video of the alleged infraction, which is reviewed by a third-party vendor before a ticket is sent to the vehicle owner.\n\nEach year the city issues approximately 1 million camera tickets, about evenly split between the two types of infractions. In all, cameras have generated more than $1.3 billion in revenue since the first one was installed nearly two decades ago.\n\nIn general, research has found that the cameras help reduce serious accidents by changing driver behavior. Northwestern University researchers found in 2017 that the number of T-bone crashes - where one vehicle drives into the side of another - fell after red-light cameras were installed, as fewer people ran red lights. According to the executive summary of the latest research by UIC associate professors Stacey Sutton and Nebiyou Tilahun, speed cameras reduced the expected number of fatal crashes and those leading to severe injury by 15%.\n\nStill, a wide array of observers has criticized the program as a revenue generator more than a public safety solution. Tickets for running a red light or going 11 or more miles per hour over the limit cost $100; with late penalties that figure can grow to $244. Citations for driving between 6 and 10 mph over the limit cost $35, an amount that increases to $85 when late.\n\nAlmost half of the tickets received by low-income residents end up incurring additional penalties, according to the research by Sutton and Tilahun, both of whom are in UIC's College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. For upper-income residents, 17% of tickets end up with additional fees.\n\nOver the years, many residents have protested that the camera tickets hurt poor people who struggle to pay the fines in time to avoid hefty late penalties and collections fees.\n\nThe issue became a priority for Reed, who leads the nonprofit Equiticity, an advocacy and research organization focused on transportation equity, when he saw how much the city relied on enforcement as a strategy to help eliminate traffic fatalities in the Vision Zero Chicago plan published in June 2017.\n\nHe has for years called on the city to stop ticketing cyclists in Black and Latino neighborhoods for riding on sidewalks and to instead improve infrastructure in those areas. He is keenly aware that people of color are disproportionately killed in traffic accidents in Chicago and across the country. But he says he doesn't think the city can ticket its way to safer streets.\n\nAt a September 2017 meeting, Reed and others asked city transportation officials to identify and eliminate any racial or geographic disparities in camera ticketing, emails show. The city never committed, Reed said.\n\n\"We didn't subscribe to this notion that the answer to improved traffic safety is a punitive approach,\" he said. \"The root cause of traffic violence in our society that is disproportionately impacting Black and brown people is structural racism.\"\n\nThe following February, ProPublica reported on how debt from parking and camera tickets disproportionately piled up in Chicago's Black neighborhoods, sending tens of thousands of people into bankruptcy. The reporting has prompted significant reforms across the state.\n\nThis is the first time ProPublica has examined the disparities in camera ticketing itself, not just the financial consequences. The analysis relies on information obtained through public records requests from the city's ticket database, including the ZIP code associated with the vehicle registration for every camera ticket issued since the program's birth in 2003 through mid-2021.\n\nProPublica's main analysis relies on ticketing from 2015 through 2019 to correspond with the most recent five-year census survey data. Ticketing rates were calculated based on the number of households in each ZIP code, as there is no available and reliable measure of motorists or vehicles by ZIP codes that covers that period.\n\nThe data shows how motorists from Black and Latino areas of the city have consistently received a higher share of camera tickets. The disparity persists when you include motorists who live anywhere in Cook County but drive in the city or if you include speed warnings to first-time violators. ProPublica excluded warnings from its main analysis because they carry no financial penalties.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, some 3.1 million camera tickets went to Chicago residents. The highest share, or about 38%, of those tickets went to motorists from majority-Black ZIP codes. By comparison, those ZIP codes account for 27% of households.\n\nThe disparity is less severe in majority-Hispanic ZIP codes, which account for 19% of tickets and 16% of households.\n\nHouseholds in the city's majority Black ZIP codes received about four citations per household over that time period. That's more than twice the rate for households in majority-white ZIP codes, which received fewer than two tickets. Households in Hispanic ZIP codes received more than three tickets per household during the same time period.\n\nFor their study, which relies on census-tract level ticket data, Sutton and Tilahun looked at a shorter time period, 2016 through 2019, and arrived at a similar conclusion.\n\nRodney Perry has been caught in the cycle of ticketing. The 28-year-old entrepreneur quit his job at a logistics firm last spring to build a digital marketing and production company. The work leads him to drive past the city's cameras more than he did in his previous job. Last year, Perry received three tickets for running red lights and eight for speeding. Of the speeding tickets, five were for going just 6 or 7 mph over the limit - speeds that would not have triggered a ticket before Lightfoot lowered the threshold for tickets.\n\nHe paid some off, but the penalties eventually added up to more than $700, money he said he did not have. He tried to get on a city payment plan but said he couldn't figure out how to do that online. Because of the unpaid tickets, the city in November immobilized his 2018 Jeep Cherokee with a yellow Denver boot clamped over one of the front wheels outside his apartment. Perry had to borrow money from his older sister in Tennessee to get on a payment plan and get the boot removed, a process that came with yet more fines.\n\n\"Family doesn't ever want to see you have any moment of struggle,\" said Perry, who took on an extra job at a restaurant to help pay off the tickets and make ends meet. \"It's a financial impact, but mentally it's where I was affected the most. Mentally and emotionally.\"\n\nPerry said he takes responsibility for getting tickets. But he can't help but notice something every time he drives through majority-Black neighborhoods: There are fewer pedestrians and more vacant lots and industrial areas.\n\n\"It's almost like you feel like there is nothing there. Nothing to slow you down,\" he said.\n\nWhen Perry enters more densely populated Latino neighborhoods, he sees bustling commerce and more pedestrians. And in majority white neighborhoods, there are even more pedestrians and \"a stop light every few blocks. A stop sign between those. Crosswalks,\" he said. \"There's a million reasons to stop once you pass downtown on the North Side.\"\n\nIt all makes him wonder: Does the way a neighborhood looks affect whether a driver will get a ticket?\n\nConsider the speed camera on West 127th Street, a few blocks east of South Halsted Street in West Pullman, a majority-Black neighborhood on the city's Far South Side.\n\nThe camera sits next to a fenced-in steel plant, overlooking a busy, four-lane stretch of road where the speed limit is 30 mph. What allowed the city to place a camera there - as speed cameras are only allowed near parks or schools - is a bike trail that cuts across the street a little west of the device. It's not a frequently used path; on a bright October morning, not one cyclist passed through in the half hour or so a pair of reporters observed the trail. No pedestrians walked along that stretch of West 127th Street, either; only one side of the street even has a sidewalk.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of semitrucks and passenger vehicles roared past.\n\nAbout 20 miles north, another camera stands along a two-lane stretch of West Montrose Avenue that borders Horner Park in the whiter, more affluent Irving Park neighborhood.\n\nHere, the speed limit is also 30 mph. Drivers have to slow down to maneuver around a concrete pedestrian island and over bright green and white crosswalks that lead into the park. That same October morning, reporters encountered more than a dozen pedestrians, cyclists, dog walkers and others near the camera in about a half hour.\n\nIn 2020, the camera on West 127th Street issued 22,389 tickets to motorists caught driving 11 mph or more over the speed limit, each costing $100.\n\nThe one on West Montrose Avenue? Five.\n\nDrivers intuitively slow down when confronted with narrowed streets, speed bumps or other traffic, said Jesus Barajas, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California Davis, who has studied transportation and infrastructure in Chicago. Wide roads without what are often called calming measures, like the ones on West Montrose Avenue, encourage speeding.\n\n\"If it feels like a highway, you're going to go 50,\" Barajas said.\n\nProPublica found that all 10 locations with the speed cameras that issued the most tickets for going 11 mph or more over the limit from 2015 through 2019 are on four-lane roads. Six of those locations are in majority Black census tracts.\n\nMeanwhile, eight of the 10 locations where the fewest tickets were issued are on two-lane streets. And just two of the 10 are in majority Black census tracts. (The analysis focused on cameras near parks, because those devices operate for more hours and days than those by schools, leading them to issue the vast majority of tickets.)\n\nResidential density is another factor. Denser neighborhoods have more cars, more traffic and more pedestrians, all factors that cause motorists to intuitively slow down, experts said.\n\nAnd in Chicago, which has seen an exodus of Black residents in recent decades, Black neighborhoods are far less dense than their white counterparts.\n\nProPublica found that the 10 locations with speed cameras that issued the most tickets were in census tracts with about 6,400 people per square mile, on average. By comparison, the 10 locations with speed cameras that issued the fewest tickets were in tracts that, on average, were more than twice as dense.\n\nAnother factor in ticketing: proximity to expressways, which decades ago were built over Black communities in Chicago and across the nation. Seven of the 10 intersections with red-light cameras that issued the most tickets are within a block of an expressway entrance. Six of the 10 are in majority Black census tracts. None of the 10 intersections where red-light cameras issued the fewest tickets are near expressways, and just one is in a majority Black tract.\n\nSutton and Tilahun also found that ticketing levels are highest among red-light cameras located within 350 feet of freeways, and that Black neighborhoods account for a disproportionate share of all cameras near freeways, according to the executive summary of their paper.\n\nThe UIC researchers also found that red-light cameras in areas where there were high rates of violent crime issued more tickets. \"Perhaps people drive differently in those areas,\" Tilahun said. \"They might rush through intersections because they feel unsafe.\"\n\nCensus estimates show that Black residents are about as likely to drive to work as white residents, though they face longer commutes no matter how they get to work, according to a study by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which works on planning issues in northeastern Illinois.\n\nLow-income Black neighborhoods often lack basic amenities such as grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals, forcing drivers into their cars for longer periods of time, said Alejo Alvarado, a transportation planner who has written about how replacing traffic stops with speed cameras could disproportionately hurt low-income and minority drivers in Oakland, California.\n\n\"There's usually not retail investment or housing investment, so a lot of these communities, they're food deserts. They don't have the amenities they need,\" Alvarado said. \"I can't just walk down the street to get my groceries; I've got to drive somewhere else.\"\n\nWhen Lightfoot was running for office in 2019, she promised to reform the city's system of ticketing and debt collection. \"We cannot accept a system that has such a devastating impact on low-income people and people of color,\" she said.\n\nThe mayor has made good on her promise. The city ended a long-standing practice of seeking driver's license suspensions for unpaid parking tickets, and state lawmakers ended suspensions for any kind of ticket debt, including for unpaid camera tickets. The city has also made ticket payment plans more accessible; it used to be cheaper for motorists with a lot of ticket debt to file for bankruptcy than to get on a payment plan with the city.\n\nSo when Lightfoot proposed an expansion of the city's speed-camera program in October 2020, potentially sending tens of thousands of new tickets to the same populations already overburdened by fines and fees, it was widely seen as hypocritical. She was even criticized by some of the transportation safety advocates who support camera enforcement, including the influential Active Transportation Alliance.\n\nThough the mayor made an argument for traffic safety, alliance spokesperson Kyle Whitehead said his group suspected the proposal was more about revenue given it was made in the context of the city budget. What's more, he said, the change would be \"exposing more people to tickets without really understanding the racial equity impact of that change.\"\n\nBut Chicago officials did understand. When Lightfoot proposed the expansion, the city already had Sutton and Tilahun's preliminary findings. Sutton was dismayed to learn of the expansion.\n\n\"There's a disconnect between the data and the politics, the evidence and politics,\" Sutton said of the change. \"It doesn't align with the huge burdens that we see in the data.\"\n\nLurie defended the mayor's decision to expand the program even though the city had evidence of its disparate impact on communities of color. Lightfoot, he said, was particularly motivated after a decade-high spike in traffic fatalities in 2020.\n\n\"If someone is a reckless driver, that is a fundamental concern to the mayor,\" Lurie said. \"That fine and fee, we believe, can help change behavior. That fine and fee should not put someone in a place where they are unable to pay it, where they are making choices about whether they could put food on the table instead of paying that fine or fee.\"\n\nThe impact of lowering the speed limit threshold was huge. In 2021, the city issued more than 1.4 million tickets to motorists going 6 to 10 mph over the limit, more citations of that kind than it had issued in the combined previous eight years of the program's existence. The tickets, if paid, had the potential to bring in some $50 million in revenue.\n\nBut not everybody can pay their tickets, and the debt can upend lives. Late payments can lead to a boot being placed on a car, which might mean days away from work, making it harder to catch up with the debt. While unpaid tickets may no longer result in a license suspension, it's easy for Chicagoans to get caught in the cycle.\n\nRead More\n\n\"We end up fixing something and creating a different kind of harm,\" said Priya Sarathy Jones, the national policy and campaigns director at the Fines and Fees Justice Center, which sees cameras playing a larger role in cities' efforts to prevent traffic fatalities. \"It removes police from having contact with predominantly Black men and Black people, but you're also creating an entirely parallel universe of harm.\"\n\nSutton, who has long studied the impact of \"race neutral\" policies on communities of color, said Chicago's experience should be a cautionary tale for cities considering camera programs.\n\n\"It's the same cycle, right, in terms of their interaction with the state and with the justice system,\" Sutton said. \"But the way you enter that is not through a police officer, but through this supposedly unbiased technology. ... I don't think there's a technological fix to an unjust system.\"\n\nProPublica data reporter Haru Coryne reviewed the code and analysis.

Claim Privilege.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nLeer en español.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nEva Bonilla grows furious when she thinks about how Latino voters are treated by the Republican power structure in Texas. At 74, the small business owner watched the GOP Legislature pass a series of measures like a voter ID law that she felt would make it harder for Latinos to cast ballots or run for public office.\n\nTwo years ago, serving as the leader of a Hispanic women's group in Fort Worth, she decided to strike back. The Republican Legislature had just pushed through new election maps that carved up Latino communities and made it even harder for them to elect candidates of their choice. So Bonilla joined other minority voters as plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit alleging intentional discrimination in the 2021 redistricting plan.\n\n\"I wanted to see the right thing done, and this is just not right,\" she said.\n\nThen Bonilla waited.\n\nIn 2022, an election came and went with districts based on the challenged maps. It has now achieved a dubious distinction: Of the 87 lawsuits filed over the 2021 congressional and legislative redistricting plans nationwide, it has dragged on the longest without having held a trial. As another election looms, a trial date has not even been set.\n\nThe reason? Republican leaders asserted their rights to block the most routine give-and-take of lawsuits, resisting handing over documents, providing discovery or submitting to depositions - in effect squashing Bonilla's efforts to uncover how the 2021 maps were drawn. The lawmakers have done so by the rigorous use of two forms of privilege: the better known attorney-client privilege and what is known as legislative privilege, which allows elected members of state legislatures to deliberate in private.\n\nAs the Texas case drags on, legislatures across the country are making new and expansive claims of privilege to keep electoral maps in place and prevent the public from finding out how they made their decisions and why.\n\nTexas lawmakers did not stumble upon these tactics on their own. A national GOP redistricting group helped train Republican lawmakers in Texas on how to approach lawsuits and raised money to pay legal costs. The lawmakers also passed a new law to further protect their deliberations. In addition, they put an outside political operative on the state's payroll so that the legislative privilege could shield his activities. Finally, they relied on GOP map-drawers who worked for law firms, which allowed lawmakers to assert that the maps were \"legal advice.\"\n\nThroughout, the Texas lawmakers have contended they did not discriminate against Latino voters.\n\nIn Louisiana, North Dakota and elsewhere, Republicans have resisted challenges to their maps by asserting privilege. In Washington, Democrats have done the same. Legal experts say the expanding use of privilege robs plaintiffs of key insights. To succeed in court, plaintiffs in many cases have to show legislators intended to discriminate. Without access, explained Harvard Law School professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, it becomes \"very difficult to prove intent even where it was actually present.\"\n\nThe concept of legislative privilege is protected under the U.S. Constitution's speech and debate clause , and 43 states have embedded it in their constitutions. Originally intended to protect legislators from criminal or civil claims for things they said on the floor, it has come to encompass lawmakers' work-related communications. In theory, affording such protection allowed for frank conversations.\n\nBut in the past, people who wanted to scrutinize a legislature's activities had another, if narrower, way to find out what was going on: They could file open records requests to get access to interactions lawmakers had with outside third parties, such as consultants or political operatives. In Texas and elsewhere, Republicans have succeeded in shielding even these once-public interactions.\n\nConservative judges in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several states including Texas, and the 8th Circuit, which covers the Dakotas, have recently sided with state legislatures that have used expanded privilege claims to prevent public review. Recently, Arizona Republicans appealed to the 9th Circuit to shield their deliberations .\n\nPartisan battles have long been a staple of redistricting, which happens every 10 years. But as more states craft their new maps out of public sight, the fights are ending up in drawn-out court cases, with enormous consequences for voters. The lawsuits are taking so long to resolve that six states conducted their 2022 elections under maps that had been ruled illegal by lower courts, according to a recent analysis by Democracy Docket, a progressive website that tracks redistricting cases. They await resolution. Lawsuits challenging maps in seven other states were still awaiting court action when the elections took place.\n\nThe Texas GOP undertook its mapmaking effort as the state was undergoing a significant demographic shift. Latinos now slightly outnumber non-Hispanic white people in the state, and they and other minorities account for almost all population growth in the last decade, according to census data. Many of these new residents will likely vote for the Democratic Party. Through aggressive redistricting, however, Republicans have been able to maintain control of the Legislature, all major statewide offices and the state's congressional delegation. And they grabbed one of the two new seats in Congress gained through the population increases.\n\n\"Elections can't really be unwound. You can't go back and change the composition of the Texas Legislature from 2022,\" said Yurij Rudensky, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan legal institute. The center represents a separate group of minority plaintiffs who are challenging the state's maps. The Justice Department has joined the plaintiffs. \"So using discriminatory districts cuts to the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nTo reconstruct how Texas Republicans stalled the legal fight over their redrawn districts, ProPublica used federal court records in six states as well as interviews with experts, voters and former state officials. Combined they provide the fullest account yet of how state lawmakers hobbled the opposition and hidden their activities.\n\nKeith Gaddie, a former bipartisan litigation consultant, said that in his experience, lawmakers keep their methods secret when they are aggressively gaming the process for political gain. \"The more egregious the gerrymander, the less information can be made available about the process,\" he said. \"It's a nasty, nasty business.\"\n\nRedistricting in Texas was two years away when leaders of the Virginia-based National Republican Redistricting Trust flew into Houston for a poolside briefing for GOP supporters.\n\nEstablished in 2017 to counter a similar Democratic Party redistricting operation, the NRRT and its nonprofit affiliate, Fair Lines America, had many Texas ties. Senior leadership included powerful Texan Karl Rove, a former White House official and longtime consultant to Texas governors.\n\nAt the closed event in 2019 in a Houston suburb, Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey mingled with party loyalists to discuss the two or three new seats they should get in Congress as the state's population boomed, according to social media accounts and interviews. A young supporter took selfies with Washington influencers like James \"Trey\" Trainor , a Texas lawyer whose nomination by President Donald Trump to the Federal Election Commission was being blocked by Democrats because of his criticisms of campaign finance laws. On Instagram, the supporter described it as a helpful session on the \"threats and opportunities redistricting presents.\"\n\nThe NRRT's executive director is Adam Kincaid, a former Republican National Committee strategist. Kincaid had become the go-to conservative voice on redistricting within the party. Soon, he would take a hands-on role in drawing Texas' congressional map. Kincaid declined to comment on his work in Texas \"due to ongoing litigation.\"\n\nOn a party podcast , Kincaid had pushed Republicans to counter what he described as the Democrat's plan to \"sue till it's blue.\" The NRRT distributed talking points asserting that \"Democrats are sitting back counting the cash they plan to use on their trial lawyers to fund their strategy of endless litigation,\" according to a document secured by the watchdog American Oversight .\n\nIn the podcast, Kincaid said the NRRT, which does not have to disclose its donors, would send resources to states facing challenges. Separately, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas promoted a super PAC that raised money to hire redistricting experts and legal counsel and brought in $500,000 in a single day.\n\nTexas had been mired in voting rights litigation for almost a decade. Groups representing Latino and Black voters had sued after the 2010 census too, making similar allegations to today. Then, a district court judicial panel rejected the state's map, ruling that large portions of it were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders and ordering maps to be redrawn. Republicans tried to assert legislative privilege over internal emails, but judges rejected the arguments and ordered the documents released.\n\nEmails exposed GOP staffers plotting about how to draw maps to maximize Republican influence in Latino areas, or as one staffer put it: creating \"Optimal Hispanic Republican Voting Strength.\"\n\nA state lawyer dismissed their plan in Spanish, \"No Bueno,\" slang for \"No Good.\" He warned them not to create a paper trail. The court found discriminatory intent.\n\nThe state appealed. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in 2018 reversed the lower court and sided with the Republicans in a 5-4 ruling.\n\nHaving been embarrassed after 2010, GOP leaders promised transparency this time around. Instead, they took the opposite tack, said Glenn Smith, an author and longtime Houston reporter and Democratic consultant: \"Hide as much as possible.\"\n\nA leader in the buildup to the 2021 redistricting was Republican state Rep. Phil King, a lawyer who has championed religious liberty and Second Amendment issues. King chaired the House Redistricting Committee and set up a tutorial for members in 2019 featuring Ryan Bangert, a hardliner who was appointed by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. It was obvious, said one attendee, that King was \"preemptively trying to make sure members covered their tracks.\" King's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn his presentation, Bangert raised what he called \"caution flags,\" according to a tape of the meeting. While judges had differing interpretations of privilege, it was generally waived if information was shared with outside third parties like lobbyists. \"Be very careful,\" he said, of tweets or barroom conversations. Bangert now advises a conservative legal group. His spokesperson said that he had no further redistricting involvement.\n\nKing was the ideal person to lead the fight. He had star billing in 2019 at two sessions of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group of state lawmakers, lobbyists and executives that works to draft and spread conservative legislation. King, a national board member of the council, spoke on a panel that delivered a primer on redistricting challenges. Drawing maps favorable to the GOP while preserving minority rights was tricky, party leaders said at the sessions.\n\nGOP strategist Cleta Mitchell, who later took a lead role in Trump's 2020 election denial effort, worked with the council's redistricting committee. She moderated King's panel at the annual convention, telling the audience sarcastically that it would teach them \"how to gerrymander.\" Slate, which posted leaked audio , said the speakers encouraged \"trashing potential evidence.\"\n\nThe legislators did not want to rely solely on their own discretion, however. In May 2019, a Republican House member from Fort Worth used a routine housekeeping bill to mount a sweeping assault on open records. He slipped a provision into the bill that closed off public access to internal redistricting records. It passed before transparency advocates noticed.\n\nThe bill shielded lawmakers' communications with staff, even interns, as well as outside contractors who might normally be considered third parties. Other legislatures have adopted similar measures. Florida has exempted redistricting documents from its Sunshine Law since 1993, and North Carolina's Republican-led Legislature recently buried a similar exemption in its 625-page budget bill. The Democratic-led Legislature in Washington is under a court challenge for using a loophole in the state constitution to exclude lawmakers from open records requests related to redistricting.\n\nIn addition to passing the law, Texas Republicans assembled legal heavy hitters who, in turn, hired subcontractors who could work behind attorney-client privilege. The House paid more than $1 million to Butler Snow LLP, which hired a Virginia-based demographer to draw maps for the state House of Representatives. (The legal contracts were obtained by American Oversight through an open records request sent before the law was passed.)\n\nThen, for the national congressional seats, 22 GOP members of the Texas Legislature hired Chris Gober, former general counsel for the state Republican Party. It's not unusual for states or members to retain outside counsel. But what Gober then did was hire the NRRT, an outside party, paying the group a mere $5,000. That secured Kincaid's map-drawing services, according to Gober's deposition. He said Kincaid \"had the mouse\" on the computer drawing congressional maps.\n\nGober said he is not proficient with redistricting software and hires subcontractors to work under his direction. \"That arrangement - and our assertion of attorney-client privilege - is not any different than the other circumstances where our firm hires subcontractors,\" he said.\n\nIn the Texas case, NRRT legal counsel Jason Torchinsky argued that Kincaid should not have to give a deposition because it would \"deter full and honest discussions\" between NRRT and partners. After a year of wrangling, a judge ordered Kincaid to answer questions and a deposition is scheduled for early November.\n\nTorchinsky himself has become a key figure in helping Republicans with redistricting. In 2022, he helped devise a new congressional map for the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis . The governor's plan, which faces a federal lawsuit, reduced the voting power of Black residents. A state judge has since ordered the map redrawn. Torchinsky did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nWhile Kincaid focused on drawing a map for the state's congressional seats, GOP map-drawer Adam Foltz arrived from Wisconsin in 2021 to assist the local effort. By then, Republican state Rep. Todd Hunter had succeeded King as House redistricting chairman. Hunter had a checkered history in redistricting; judges in 2011 had criticized him for drawing maps that undermined Latinos , according to The Texas Tribune. Hunter gave Foltz a $120,000-a-year state job, the Tribune reported, and he enjoyed such high-level access that Democrats noticed his car parked in a special driveway for members. Foltz, whose work also fell under the umbrella of privilege, drew a state salary even after map drawing concluded, and he recently got a $6,000 cost-of-living increase.\n\nFoltz had a similar arrangement in Wisconsin, a state lawyers often cite as a poster child for improper government secrecy and prolonged litigation in its 2010 redistricting cycle. Working from a private law firm, Foltz drew maps that later were thrown out, according to local press reports. Foltz remained in a $50,000-a-year state job during litigation. He later gave testimony that a judicial panel called \"almost laughable.\" Foltz declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Hunter's office did not respond.\n\nFoltz's deposition in the Texas case remains sealed by order of the court. He is still asserting legislative privilege to try to prevent giving access to his mapping work to the Justice Department, which joined the plaintiffs who are challenging the maps.\n\nThe fight carried over to the Texas Senate as well. Republican-led redistricting helped end the Senate tenure of Beverly Powell, a Democrat. She said she knew she had a target on her back from the time she was elected, unseating a Tea Party Republican in 2018.\n\nPowell's Senate District 10 in Tarrant County, an unpredictable swing district in recent years, was one of several seats Republicans wanted to reclaim to consolidate their power.\n\nShe expected a bad result when the Republican chair of the Senate Redistricting Committee, Joan Huffman, secluded herself to draw a new Senate map. When Powell was finally called in to view it, what she saw outraged her. Her district's minority communities had been split up, diluting their voting strength, while largely white rural counties had been added.\n\n\"I know exactly what you are trying to do,\" Powell said she told Huffman. She dashed off a warning to other senators that Huffman's plan was discriminatory.\n\nSenate District 10 Was Transformed Dramatically After Redistricting in 2021\n\nThe district previously represented racially diverse communities near Fort Worth, but it now encompasses portions of sprawling rural counties with mostly white constituents.\n\nHuffman insisted her map was \"race-blind.\" Her plan sailed through, with a notable dissent from former redistricting chair Sen. Kel Seliger, a Republican then feuding with some fellow Republicans. The Amarillo senator later testified that Huffman's map \"violated the Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nPowell tried unsuccessfully to convince a court to delay the 2022 primary election. She dropped out of the race for reelection, and the powerful House veteran King took her seat.\n\nPowell's complaint about the district is now part of LULAC v. Abbott, the redistricting case now awaiting trial. Her case stands out because \"she has much more information about what happened than any of the rest of us do,\" said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nRead More\n\nRepublicans have asserted privilege in the Senate mapping fight as well. Overall for all the mapping, their claims cover about two-thirds of the documents the Justice Department wants, including drafts of maps, emails and calendars that reflect protected \"thoughts, opinions and mental impressions,\" documents show. The legislature has disputed that estimate.\n\nThe case stalled for a year while the 5th Circuit weighed privilege in another Texas case. Written by Trump appointee Judge Don R. Willett, its decision defended legislative privilege \"even when constitutional rights are at stake.\" The 8th Circuit also ruled in June in a North Dakota redistricting case that privilege \"protects the functioning of the legislature.\"\n\nJudges in the redistricting case are weighing how these decisions impact 22 outstanding motions for documents and depositions.\n\nFor her part, Bonilla, the Fort Worth small business owner, says she's given up hope. \"The system has failed,\" she said.\n\nJosh Kaplan contributed reporting.

      "text": "Trump's Near Sweep of Texas Border Counties Shows a Shift to the Right for Latino Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans. Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nTexas Democrats have long viewed the state's growing Latino population as their ticket to eventually breaking through the Republican Party's dominance. Tuesday night, however, showed that the GOP has made significant gains in peeling away those voters, and nowhere was that more apparent than along the border.\n\nAfter years of losing the statewide Latino vote by double digits, Republicans set a high-water mark with Donald Trump capturing 55% of the critical voting bloc, besting Vice President Kamala Harris' 44% share, according to exit polls .\n\nIn the traditionally Democratic strongholds along the border, Trump managed a near sweep.\n\nHe won 14 out of the 18 counties within 20 miles of the border, a number that doubled his attention-grabbing 2020 performance in the Latino-majority region. He carried all four counties in the Rio Grande Valley just eight years after drawing a mere 29% in the region - a feat that included delivering 97% Latino Starr County to Republicans for the first time since 1896 . And, though he lost El Paso, one of the border's most populous counties, he narrowed margins there in ways not seen in decades.\n\nCounties Along the Border Continue to Flip\n\nTrump was the top vote-getter in a majority of the counties along the Texas-Mexico border in 2024. This continues the trend of border counties voting more conservatively in presidential races. Shown is how many counties have voted for each party's candidate in each race since 1996.\n\n2000\n\n1996\n\nDEM.\n\n12\n\nREP.\n\n6\n\nDEM.\n\n16\n\nREP.\n\n2\n\n2008\n\n2004\n\nDEM.\n\n14\n\nREP.\n\n4\n\nDEM.\n\n10\n\nREP.\n\n8\n\n2016\n\n2012\n\nDEM.\n\n13\n\nREP.\n\n5\n\nDEM.\n\n13\n\nREP.\n\n5\n\n2020\n\n2024\n\nDEM.\n\n11\n\nREP.\n\n7\n\nDEM.\n\n4\n\nREP.\n\n14\n\nHis gains along the border were the most for a Republican presidential candidate in at least 30 years, exceeding even the inroads made by native Texan George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nTrump's success in appealing to heavily Latino communities was evident throughout the country as he became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Miami-Dade County in more than three decades and nearly doubled his share of the Latino vote in Pennsylvania , even after a comedian at one of his rallies called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\" But Trump's performance is particularly striking in Texas, where Democrats have all but tied their fate to the idea that, as long as the state's Latino electorate continued to grow and stayed reliably blue, Republicans would one day cease to win statewide elections.\n\nIn addition to dominating the presidential race, Republicans saw other gains along the border. U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz , a Republican from Edinburg, held onto a key GOP seat anchored in the Rio Grande Valley, and Republicans picked up a state Senate seat and two state House districts in South Texas that were previously held by Democrats. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz , who won reelection by carrying a majority of Latino voters, said the results amounted to \"generational change.\"\n\nDemocrats saw their own bright spots. Eddie Morales Jr. , a state representative for a sprawling border district that stretches from Eagle Pass to El Paso, held onto his seat on Tuesday, though he narrowly eked out a victory two years after winning by a more comfortable 12-point margin. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar , a Democrat from Laredo, also won by an unexpectedly narrow margin of about 5 percentage points against a GOP challenger whom he vastly outspent.\n\nJoshua Blank, research director for the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said it's too early to tell if Republican gains will hold or extend beyond Trump himself. But, Blank said, Democrats would be wise to worry about the possibility that this shift endures.\n\nTrump's success among Latino voters seemed to stem from an understanding that, in places like Texas, many Latinos \"think of themselves as multiracial\" and have grown up in communities where race and ethnicity are not top of mind, Blank said. Trump targeted Hispanic men who rarely vote by appealing \"to their pocketbooks, to their masculinity, to their place in culture and society, but not directly to an identity as a racial and ethnic minority.\"\n\n\"Does that mean that these voters are going to stay in the Republican column? We don't know. Does it mean that they're going to support somebody who's not named Donald Trump? Unclear,\" Blank said. \"But he has changed the terms of the debate in a way that I think Democrats are uncomfortable with.\"\n\nBorder Counties Making Rightward Shift Toward Trump\n\nNine counties within 20 miles of the Texas-Mexico border flipped from supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 to Republican Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nNot unlike his appeal among other constituencies, Trump won over Latino voters by hammering Harris on economic challenges that many of them - rightly and wrongly - blame on President Joe Biden.\n\nUniversity of Houston political science professor Jeronimo Cortina said Trump's challenge now would be to deliver on his promises to improve voters' economic fortunes. And he said he'd expect voters to hold Trump accountable if he doesn't. Cortina noted that many Latinos supported Bush's 2004 reelection, only to desert the Republican Party in favor of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 amid a flailing economy.\n\n\"Realignments occur when there's a sustainable change, and right now, it's not clear we have that,\" Cortina said.\n\nHe also said it would be premature to say whether Trump's appeal - to say nothing of the Republican Party's - was anything other than fleeting because, in local races, Latinos still tended to prefer Democrats.\n\nOne such example is the race for sheriff in Val Verde County, nearly three hours west of San Antonio.\n\nIn that race, Democrat Joe Frank Martinez held onto his seat, beating his Republican challenger after receiving 57% of the vote, even as Trump won the county with 63% of the vote.\n\nAccording to Martinez, Project Red TX, a GOP-backed PAC, initially tried to get him to switch parties. When he declined, the PAC backed his opponent, who ran a campaign centered around the issue of immigration, even though that is not part of the sheriff's job.\n\nThis year, the group supported more than 50 local candidates, primarily in border counties. The three candidates it backed in Val Verde County lost, though Wayne Hamilton, a veteran GOP operative who heads the group, noted that he also supported a number of local candidates who won their races with Trump carrying the county atop the ballot. One such case was in Jim Wells County, where Trump received 57% and the Democratic sheriff was narrowly ousted by a Republican challenger.\n\nHamilton said Latino voters living at or near the border flocked to Trump over what they see as the Biden administration's \"collapse in border enforcement and failing to do their job\" by preventing more migrants from crossing into Texas.\n\nRecord numbers of arrivals overwhelmed border infrastructure in numerous communities. In Val Verde, some 20,000 mostly Haitian migrants arrived almost at once in 2021, forcing officials to shut the international port of entry while they figured out how to respond to the situation.\n\nPublic outcry was most acute, Hamilton said, in counties with high poverty rates where residents were more likely to feel that their community was \"being overrun by people that are even poorer, with even greater needs.\"\n\nHamilton celebrated that Trump flipped Starr by 16 points this year, a 76-point swing from his 60-point deficit there in 2016.\n\nDown the ballot, though, Democrats, including the incumbent sheriff, managed to hold on to their positions despite aggressive campaigns on the Republican side. \"All of those candidates that ran as Democrats, all won, so the Trump presidency is basically an isolated seat,\" Starr County Democratic Chair Jessica Vera said.\n\nStill, she said, if national and statewide Democrats want to keep the county blue, they need to work together with local leaders to connect with voters there.\n\nHamilton said some newly converted Trump voters might feel less inclined to vote against their local Democratic officials, especially in the smaller border counties, because they tend to be known in the community.\n\n\"The further down the ballot you go, it all becomes more personal,\" Hamilton said. \"It's not a guy I see on TV, right? It's the guy I go to Mass with.\"\n\nRead More\n\nLocal Democratic Party officials, including Sylvia Bruni in Webb County, a longtime Democratic stronghold, said they had warned their state and national headquarters about the advances Republicans were making in their districts. But she said she had gotten little support and instead had to rely almost entirely on whatever funds her group could raise on its own.\n\nThat's not going to be good enough in the future, Bruni said. \"We need help.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nPerla Trevizo is a reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDan Keemahill is a data reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The Failed Promise of Independent Election Mapmaking\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWashington state's mapmakers had been working for almost a year to draw the lines that would shape the state's elections for the next decade. Now they had five hours until the midnight deadline and they'd made little progress.\n\nPromptly at 7 p.m. on Nov. 15, 2021, the five members of the state's Redistricting Commission appeared in a public Zoom meeting. Chair Sarah Augustine, a nonvoting member, sat near an ice machine in front of a backdrop with the commission's new logo, \"Draw Your WA.\" She called the roll and ratified the minutes. The commissioners appeared on screens, seemingly calling in from different locations. Augustine immediately announced that they wanted to caucus privately. She promised that staff would reappear about every 30 minutes to give updates. A sign announcing \"Meeting on Break\" flashed up.\n\nIn most states, lawmakers draw new districts every 10 years to accommodate changes in population and ethnic makeup. They're usually exercises of raw political power allowing lawmakers to, in essence, choose their voters instead of the other way around. But in Washington, an independent panel of commissioners has long revised the maps to avoid the common pitfalls of such redistricting, which often disenfranchises people of color or results in gerrymandering.\n\nThis year, Augustine's master's degree in conflict resolution was failing her. The commission's work had devolved into a partisan mess, the very thing it had been created to avoid. The two Democratic commissioners and their two Republican counterparts had fought over how to address complaints from the state's growing Latino population that it didn't have representation. As they tried to work out a deal, they were repeatedly distracted by lawmakers and at least one lobbyist who had gotten wind of the final meeting and wanted to weigh in.\n\nIn a desperate move, the commission opted for a charade, with the public Zoom as its cover. In reality, the four voting commissioners were secretly hashing out the maps in person at a Hampton Inn a healthy 40 miles outside the capital, Olympia. It was a violation of the rules for more than two members to negotiate in private. One commissioner balked and rented a room in a Marriott a short distance away.\n\nThroughout the process, the members of this ostensibly independent body were consulting with their party leaders and state and national political operatives, and were relying on partisan funding. Throughout the night, a cadre of lawmakers continued to pepper the commissioners with requests as picayune as moving one constituent's house into a different district.\n\nEvery half-hour, a staffer briefly came on camera to inform viewers that caucuses continued. An interpreter even signed for deaf viewers. No member of the public ever saw any maps they could comment on, however. Then the break notice would go up again. As one commissioner later joked to another, the spectacle was \"the screenplay to a movie no one would want to watch.\"\n\nThe commissioners blew past their midnight deadline as they scrambled to reach deals and haggled over the \"price\" of Latino representation. The two Democrats finally capitulated to Republican demands, allowing a map that they felt didn't give Latinos enough representation. They hadn't been able to finish the job but hoped the courts would resolve the issue.\n\nThe independent commission's work had been a disaster. A federal judge threw out the map in August 2023 after determining it had discriminated against Latinos. The commissioners were fined for their public meeting deception.\n\nIt was an ignominious referendum on Washington's redistricting model. As the nation grapples with ever-more-aggressive battles over access to voting, a review of what unfolded in Washington shows that independent commissions - still reformers' best hope for fixing this problem nationwide - have not always succeeded in taking this central democratic function out of politicians' hands.\n\nWhile independent commissions usually make fairer maps than their legislative counterparts, all over the country some, like Washington, have stumbled. Several were not the bulwark against discrimination that supporters had hoped. In 2021, five states with independent commissions faced lawsuits over their maps. In New York, an independent commission bungled the job so badly that the state legislature stepped in to create new maps. Then a judge threw those maps out. The independent commission has been reconvened to create new congressional maps. Michigan's new independent commission lost a federal lawsuit brought by Black voters in Detroit. A judicial panel has ordered the commission to redraw maps and the case is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn Washington state, criticism of the commission's work has been so intense that lawmakers decided not to reconvene the group to draw the new maps. Even good-government types have been aghast. Simone Leeper, a legal counsel for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which handles voting-rights cases and represented Latino plaintiffs in Washington, says, \"Going about this in this secretive way to trade away the rights of individuals is abhorrent to the concept of these commissions and what they're intended to do.\"\n\nWashington was the third state in the nation to set up an independent commission. State voters approved it by constitutional amendment in 1983 after the Legislature, then led by Republicans, passed a redistricting plan that was found to be discriminatory by a federal court, which ordered new maps to be drawn.\n\nThrough several redistricting cycles, Washington's commission worked smoothly, praised as a national model for how to fix the process of drawing lines for congressional and state legislative districts. The commission's enabling legislation prohibited gerrymandering, or drawing lines to favor one party or undermine the voting power of a demographic group. Commission members could meet with lawmakers individually to hear specific requests, but public input was paramount since every voter had a stake in how the lines were drawn.\n\nToday, 22 states have some type of independent commission to handle map-drawing, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\n\nWashington's model is known as a bipartisan commission, which purports to be independent. But legislators still play a significant role. House and Senate majority and minority leaders choose four commission members by political affiliation, with one nonvoting member put in place to mediate. Liaisons for both political parties are assigned to monitor the commission and report back to caucuses. The commission gets around $2 million for staffing and expenses, but state political parties sometimes step in to cover expenses for studies or other activities that have a partisan slant.\n\nThe start of this redistricting cycle was dogged by controversy. Members chosen for the 2021 Washington commission had strong legislative ties. Republicans Joe Fain and Paul Graves and Democrat Brady Piñero Walkinshaw were former lawmakers. Democrat April Sims was an executive with the Washington State Labor Council, chosen by House Speaker Laurie Jinkins to represent the House Democratic caucus. Augustine, the nonvoting member, was chosen by the other members.\n\nThis commission began in rancor. Fain, a former senator from King County, had lost his 2018 reelection bid after a former Seattle city official publicly accused him of sexual assault. Fain denied the allegation, and the woman declined to press charges. But Walkinshaw and Sims sided with protestors and called, unsuccessfully, for Fain to resign. Fain did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nFrom the start, the commissioners faced pressure from the surging Latino population, which had grown by 14% since 2010 but still struggled to elect members of the House of Representatives. The growth had been particularly intense in the Yakima Valley agricultural region east of the Cascade Mountains, where the population includes many immigrant laborers from Mexico and South Texas.\n\nThe Yakima Valley farming region stretches for 80 miles and includes five counties, with three reporting majority Latino populations. Some small farming towns reported that as much as 80% of the population is Hispanic, according to UCLA Voting Rights Project founder Matt Barreto, who conducted an analysis of voting in the area.\n\nYet white Republicans for years had dominated political offices in the area, and Latinos complained they had been penalized by decades of \"cracking,\" a redistricting term that means splitting up communities to diminish their power. The valley's Latino population was carved into three House districts that Latinos had little chance of winning.\n\nSpanish-speaking voters won lawsuits against local governments to force changes, but little was done. \"Time and time again, there have been findings and consent decrees, and other outcomes, that make clear that this community has persistently faced discrimination in voting,\" said Campaign Legal Center's Leeper.\n\nIn 2021, as the independent commission began its work, Latino activists were hopeful. Supporters of more representation testified at virtual public meetings. \"There were so many voices,\" said Susan Soto Palmer, an advocate and unsuccessful candidate for state and county office. At the public meetings, she described taunts she faced in Yakima from white voters when campaigning and the inadequate services for her community.\n\nThe commission had been briefed by the attorney general's office about the federal Voting Rights Act, which required that it draw election maps that give Latino populations the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\n\nCommission Democrats advised getting an expert analysis of the area's voting patterns. But the two Republicans protested the hiring of UCLA expert Barreto because he had strong ties to national Democratic Party entities.\n\nSenate Democrats paid for Barreto's analysis. He concluded that the state must create at least one, possibly two, districts in the Yakima Valley with substantial Latino populations. The VRA requires that when a racial or ethnic group makes up a significant percentage of the electorate, the group should be able to elect candidates of its choice. Such a district is called a \"performing\" one. While that doesn't always mean that the group needs to be a majority in a district, in this case, Barreto determined that a new district needed to have a Latino voting-age population of around 60%. Both Democratic commissioners proposed maps with a Yakima Valley district that had a greater than 60% Latino voting-age population.\n\nThe Republicans resisted such a proposal. They offered maps that were bare-majority Latino, giving the GOP a greater chance of winning the seat. Barreto said these proposals still cracked Hispanic voters.\n\nFain and Graves turned to the state GOP to pay a Seattle law firm, which produced a legal brief justifying a more conservative-friendly map. The lawyers urged them to avoid drawing a new district solely on the basis of race. In recent years, conservative legal experts have begun to argue that the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause means that mapmakers cannot take race into account when drawing districts. The amendment supersedes the Voting Rights Act, they argue. The firm warned that the commission could face a lawsuit that claimed the map discriminated against non-Latino voters.\n\nJinkins, the House speaker, told ProPublica, \"While the Washington approach has generally worked well for us, I'm always interested to understand what other states have learned and consider incorporating changes that make sense for Washington.\" One model is California, which has been praised for creating a large commission with so many guardrails against legislative influence that it is now considered the gold standard.\n\nThe commission's November Zoom call made for excruciating video. The \"Meeting on Break\" sign stayed up for hours. Every so often, Augustine came on camera to report that private discussions continued. Staffers killed time with card games. Occasionally, a commissioner surfaced to cryptically describe what was happening behind closed doors.\n\nGraves, one of the Republicans, looked bleary-eyed on camera, later revealing in a deposition that he had a three-month old at home and hadn't slept for days. \"I know it's frustrating,\" he told viewers.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Zoom, Graves had been driving a hard bargain behind the scenes, according to text messages and emails that surfaced later.\n\nGraves and Fain texted on Nov. 7 about how they could extract a price from Democrats if the GOP agreed to their version of a 14th district. \"If you had notes on the price for their 14, can you please send them to me?\" Graves wrote Fain.\n\nOn Nov. 11, Graves emailed Democrat Sims to outline his latest \"ever so slightly more Republican proposal\" and to offer a brazen political trade. Republicans would give up some of their strength in the Yakima Valley, but only if Democrats would give them a more competitive district elsewhere.\n\n\"I will be interested to hear from you what you think is a fair price for this 14th,\" Graves wrote Sims. Graves described to ProPublica his logic: He acknowledged his offer to Sims was \"purely partisan,\" but he said he and Sims had already agreed to draw a majority-Latino district and were fine-tuning.\n\n\"One of the requirements in our statute is that the plan cannot be drawn to purposely favor or discriminate against any political party. I was trying to avoid the kind of gerrymandering where one party gets substantially more representation than its pure votes would suggest,\" he said.\n\nHe says he strongly supports independent commissions.\n\nAs they struggled to resolve the Yakima issue, commissioners kept getting distracted by lawmakers and lobbyists pushing their own agendas. Texts and emails from that evening and the days leading up to it, which were later produced in lawsuits, documented exchanges among commissioners and with legislators and special interests who were closely following the action.\n\nThe commission had no rules to limit ex parte communications. Attorneys in the lawsuits found that some records were never turned over. Sims, for example, acknowledged deleting some Nov. 15 texts that she considered personal.\n\nThat night, then-House Republican leader J.T. Wilcox texted with Graves, whom he had appointed. Graves said in a deposition that Wilcox had earlier passed along thoughts about how to shape his own district and \"keep places ... I have great affection for.\"\n\nThat night, the two discussed a logjam that had developed between Fain and Walkinshaw, who were negotiating on congressional maps.\n\nGraves told Wilcox that Walkinshaw was resisting a deal, but he still thought one was possible with a little strong-arming. Fain had \"a lot of good contacts who can make Brady's life very hard who want a deal.\"\n\nWalkinshaw told ProPublica he found the messages puzzling since he and Fain shared no political connections. Wilcox and Graves described it in interviews as a flippant comment, fired off in the heat of the moment.\n\nGraves exchanged messages with state Rep. Andrew Stokesbary, a rising leader in the House GOP.\n\nCommission staffers had been told to avoid last-minute lawmaker requests for mapping changes. But House and Senate leaders could get around this by sending messages through their party liaisons, who were on standby at the Hampton Inn.\n\nHouse Speaker Jinkins texted her liaison, requesting a mapping tweak desired by two local Democratic officials, who shared a home in Tacoma.\n\n\"Not the biggest deal,\" Jinkins wrote, asking to get the specific Tacoma street address into another district. \"Right now, it's just on the other side of the line.\"\n\nJinkins said constituents had asked her if they could remain in their previous district.\"I told them I would ask staff to see if that was possible but that I could make no promises.\"\n\nIn the end, she said, her request was denied by \"the independent, bipartisan commission.\"\n\nJamie Nixon, a former commission staffer, said Jinkins' request violated protocol and was \"a vulgar attempt to wield her power to modify a map for her own political benefit.\"\n\nFain, who had recently moved from Bellingham to Normandy Park, didn't like the district assigned to his new residence. He asked Walkinshaw if they could tweak the congressional lines to move his house.\n\nWalkinshaw rejected the idea.\n\nState government lobbyists were supposed to report any contact with the commission, but a lobbyist for the Service Employees International Union did not disclose texts she sent to Sims on the final night offering assistance finishing up the work. The lobbyist, who was in a relationship with a state Democratic leader, later got a warning letter from the state public records commission . Neither the lobbyist nor Sims responded to ProPublica's request for comment. The lobbyist's attorney said in a filing that her texts were not an attempt to influence Sims.\n\nThough commissioners resisted these entreaties, upholding their independence, they had spent precious time fending them off. \"There were text messages being exchanged as well as commissioners meeting in the hallway or in the hotel lobby,\" Democratic liaison Ali O'Neil wrote on Nov. 21, 2021. \"We were forced to compromise on our stated priorities and at times disregard what was shared with the commission during months of gathering public input.\"\n\nLobbying had been going on for months, mostly by persistent citizen groups and Native American tribes. National political operatives were involved in the state's process too, records revealed. Kurt Fritts, a former national political director for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee who now runs a state consulting firm, attended commission meetings and was briefed by Democrats throughout the process. He did not respond to emails or phone calls.\n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting PAC made a small contribution to pay for \"proprietary redistricting software,\" according to Adam Bartz, director of a fundraising arm of the Senate Democrats.\n\nGraves said he consulted the Virginia-based National Republican Redistricting Trust, which coordinates national GOP redistricting strategy. In a deposition, Graves described meeting with NRRT executive director Adam Kincaid while he was in Washington, DC., conferring with GOP members of his state's congressional delegation. Kincaid said he described to Graves the assistance the NRRT could offer with data and litigation.\n\nCommissioners finally compromised on the Yakima Valley, but only after Democrats conceded. They approved a plan almost guaranteed to bring a federal lawsuit, with a district that had only a 51.5% Latino voting-age population, which was close to what Republicans had wanted.\n\nAs the meeting wore on, Walkinshaw said it was clear the deal \"was the best result that could be achieved through bipartisan negotiation.\"\n\nGraves emailed his party leadership just before 6 a.m. to alert them a deal had been reached.\n\nCommissioners finally stumbled out of the Hampton Inn just before sunrise and reconvened the next afternoon to get their mapping recommendations drawn. Even though the commission had blown its deadline, the state Supreme Court reviewed its work and decided in late 2021 to let the mapping recommendations stand so that 2022 elections could proceed without interruption.\n\nAngry that they were once again forced to vote under maps they considered discriminatory, Soto Palmer and other plaintiffs sued in federal court, alleging the commission created a Latino district that was a \"facade.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik sided with the plaintiffs in August 2023, finding \"inequality in the electoral opportunities enjoyed by white and Latino voters.\" He ordered the state to correct the maps.\n\nBut Republicans countered, using the Seattle law firm's tack. A Latino Republican filed a federal lawsuit in March 2022, arguing that the new Latino-dominated legislative district was an illegal racial gerrymander. The plaintiff claimed that Latino voters did not need a 60% opportunity district because the maps drawn by the commission allowed the Yakima Valley to elect its first Latino Republican state senator in 2022. Progress was underway, the plaintiff maintained.\n\nA judicial panel declared the case moot after Lasnik decided the Soto Palmer case, but it is now on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nRead More\n\nJinkins and other legislative leaders decided not to reconvene the 2021 commission to draw new maps that can be used in 2024 elections. Instead, lawmakers asked the court to handle it. A special master is expected to decide soon among five proposed maps that could cost several Republicans their seats.\n\nThe commission was forced to acknowledge that its November Hampton Inn meeting violated the state's Open Public Meetings Act and its own transparency rules. It settled a lawsuit brought by the Washington Coalition for Open Government and agreed to pay about $130,000 in legal fees. Individual commissioners were fined $500 each.\n\nWith the next redistricting nearly a decade away, Mike Fancher, the coalition's president, said the Legislature should decide to \"appoint a commission and then get out of the way. Don't be involved in the staffing of it, don't be involved in the direction of it. Let this commission do its work.

      "text": "In Debate Over Chicago's Speed Cameras, Concerns Over Safety, Racial Disparities Collide\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nUpdate, July 20, 2022: On July 20, the Chicago City Council rejected a measure that would have repealed Mayor Lori Lightfoot's lowered threshold for $35 speed camera tickets.\n\nAs Chicago's City Council debates whether to rein in a controversial expansion of the city's speed camera ticketing program, elected officials are wrestling with whether the devices have improved traffic safety enough to justify their financial burden on Black and Latino motorists.\n\nIt's a difficult, complex question, and it comes at a moment when the city has witnessed a series of high-profile fatal traffic crashes - including several involving children .\n\nIn this context, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is defending her policy lowering the threshold for speeding tickets from 10 mph over the limit to 6. The lowered threshold, which comes with $35 tickets and went into effect in March 2021, is projected to bring in some $40 million to $45 million in revenue this year. (Previously, the city issued $35 tickets to motorists caught speeding 10 mph over the limit and $100 tickets for those caught at higher speeds.)\n\nThe City Council is expected to vote this month on a measure proposed by Alderman Anthony Beale, who represents a ward on the South Side, to repeal the lowered threshold.\n\nBeale and his allies say the mayor's move was a cash grab that comes at the expense of motorists who can least afford it. Lightfoot and those who support maintaining the lowered threshold say they are motivated by safety.\n\nProPublica's reporting has helped inform the debate. Since 2018, we have reported on how Chicago's ticketing system - including parking, compliance and automated red-light and speed camera citations - disproportionately hurt Black motorists, sending tens of thousands into bankruptcy.\n\nIn January, we reported on how households in Black and Latino ZIP codes received camera tickets at about twice the rate of those in white ZIP codes. That reporting was primarily based on an analysis of data on red-light and speed camera citations issued between 2015 and 2019, but we also examined tickets issued to motorists going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit in the first two months of the program's expansion. Racial disparities persisted.\n\nProPublica identified some road design and neighborhood-based differences that seem to contribute to the disparities in ticketing, such as wider streets with more lanes that lend themselves to speeding in areas with higher proportions of Black and Latino residents.\n\nA study from the University of Illinois at Chicago released in January found similar racial disparities in camera ticketing in addition to a greater financial burden from late penalties on households in low-income Black and Latino neighborhoods. The study also found a 15% reduction in the expected number of crashes leading to fatal and incapacitating injuries during a three-year period after cameras were installed.\n\nBeale's motion passed out of the Finance Committee in June; when a vote was scheduled for the full City Council, Lightfoot's allies used a parliamentary maneuver to postpone it, reportedly to buy time to kill it. It's now expected to go to the City Council on July 20. If it's approved, Lightfoot is expected to veto the measure, which would be a first for her administration.\n\nGiven all this, here are a few important points to consider as the City Council weighs whether to change the program:\n\nCity officials pointed to the UIC research on the safety effects of the speed cameras as a reason to keep the lower threshold in place. That study, however, covers a time period before the lowered threshold took effect.\n\nIn response to questions, city Department of Transportation officials said that the average recorded speeds of all vehicles passing by cameras dropped about 1 mph and the number of tickets issued to drivers going 11 mph or more over the limit has also dropped since the change. In addition, the city said there is preliminary evidence that the number of injury-producing crashes near cameras has decreased since the threshold was implemented. These changes, the city said, reflect a \"collective slowing down of vehicles.\"\n\nStacey Sutton and Nebiyou Tilahun, both of UIC's College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, found that the safety benefits from the speed cameras were not universal. At 16 of the 101 camera sites studied, researchers observed what they called a \"marked\" increase in crashes over what would have been expected had the devices not been installed at those locations.\n\nThey recommended that, where cameras have not reduced crashes, the city move the devices to other locations or turn them off, and that it examine the decision-making process it uses to choose where to put them.\n\nThat process is ongoing, the city said. \"We are obligated to perform an empirical and thoughtful process, before abruptly removing a safety tool from our streets,\" city officials said in a statement. \"With that said, we have not ruled out moving or eliminating cameras and are prepared to make changes to the program in the near future.\" In January, city officials had told ProPublica they would not consider reducing the number of the speed cameras in the program.\n\nSutton said she was disappointed the city had not yet acted on the recommendations. \"The cameras do improve safety,\" she said, \"but they don't all improve safety all of the time.\"\n\nThe city said it did respond to the UIC findings on racial disparities. Before the report was published, the mayor rolled out a program that offers low-income motorists some debt forgiveness if they sign up for a plan to pay off some of their recently accrued citations, minus any late penalties.\n\n\"The numbers [showing racial disparities] are stark and awful, and it's a warning sign to many of us to think differently and to step back,\" said Leah Shahum, the founder and executive director of Vision Zero Network, a national nonprofit group that helps communities set and reach the goals of eliminating traffic fatalities and severe injuries. \"We are asking the question: Are we thinking of unintentional consequences?\"\n\nShe pointed to examples of cities and states on the West Coast that have tried to incorporate equity and infrastructure into their camera programs. In Washington state, for example, lawmakers require cities with new speed camera programs to direct some of the ticket revenue toward improving safety for pedestrians, cyclists and people with disabilities. In addition, state law requires cities that install new speed cameras to produce an equity report at the end of a pilot period.\n\nIn California, lawmakers have considered - but not passed - legislation that would allow some cities to try speed camera programs as long as equity is taken into account in the placement of the devices, among other restrictions. The only way cities could maintain cameras is if they could be shown to improve safety through a reduction in the number of tickets issued.\n\nConcerns about racial equity in automated camera enforcement have been picking up across the country and even internationally since the ProPublica and UIC reports. In February, the nonprofit transportation news site Streetsblog New York examined New York City's camera enforcement program , raising questions about inequities in infrastructure and ticketing that are similar to those in Chicago.\n\nIn Toronto, transportation safety advocates supported a measure this winter to require the city to conduct an equity analysis after an expansion of that city's speed camera program. That initiative, which was ultimately withdrawn, aimed to ensure the automated enforcement did not \"result in over policing of racialized communities and people,\" according to the measure's language.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya Sarathy Jones, national policy and campaigns director with the nonprofit Fines and Fees Justice Center, said she's been getting calls from more and more cities that are interested in camera enforcement as an alternative to potentially biased police officers making traffic stops.\n\n\"We're also seeing that there's a lot more acknowledgement that it's not a straightforward solution,\" she said. \"We're getting questions about how and if we can implement an equitable automated enforcement program, and if you can, what does that look like?\"\n\nOlatunji Oboi Reed, the president and CEO of Equiticity, a Chicago-based racial equity in transportation organization, supports repealing the lowered speeding threshold because it would reduce the volume of tickets to Black and Latino motorists.\n\nInstead of relying on a punitive strategy, Reed said, \"what the city should be doing is reengineering our streets to reduce traffic violence and reduce the need for automated enforcement.\"\n\nGroups that have long supported speed camera ticketing also want to see a larger focus on the underlying infrastructure.\n\n\"What Chicago really needs is a citywide approach to redesign dangerous streets and add life-saving infrastructure that protects people when walking and biking and makes the street safer for everyone,\" Kyle Whitehead, a spokesperson for the Active Transportation Alliance, a local road safety advocacy group, said in a statement.\n\nAlthough Active Transportation initially spoke out against the lowered threshold, saying it was unclear how low-income and minority motorists would be affected, it now wants to keep the lower threshold in place. \"High-crash streets in majority Black and Brown neighborhoods should be prioritized for safety improvements to ensure rates of speeding decline and residents in these areas are not overburdened with fines,\" Whitehead said.\n\nSutton, one of the researchers behind the UIC report, said the city should spend the ticket revenue it's getting from the lowered threshold on infrastructure and traffic-calming measures, including reducing the number of lanes, installing speed bumps and adding signs that tell motorists how fast they're going.\n\nRead More\n\nWe don't actually know exactly how that revenue is spent. The city is limited by state law in how it can use the money it gets from speed camera tickets; police spending accounts for the vast majority of what's allowed, according to budget documents. But city officials said they could not provide a breakdown of how the additional revenue from the lowered threshold is spent.\n\nThe city said it has made significant investments in pedestrian infrastructure during Lightfoot's administration. Officials pointed to her capital infrastructure plan, which provides $20 million a year for programming aimed at eliminating traffic fatalities and injuries, and an average of 400 pedestrian safety improvements installed a year. The city also plans to install 100 more of those digital speed signs near speed cameras this year.\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

      "text": "Public Schools Are NYC's Main Youth Mental Health System. Where Kids Land Often Depends on What Their Parents Can Pay.\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with THE CITY . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nOn Staten Island, a middle schooler with a hair-trigger temper was in a fistfight every week. In north Brooklyn, a ninth grader cut class for months before he tried to commit suicide. A few miles east, where Brooklyn meets the marshlands of Jamaica Bay, a 13-year-old ended up in a psychiatric emergency room after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down her school.\n\nThese kids all had two things in common: First, they were part of a growing cohort of students with serious mental health and behavioral problems that got in the way of their education. And second, they lived in New York City, which meant that their problems became, at least in part, the responsibility of the city's school system.\n\nUnder federal law, school districts are required to provide all students, including those with mental health and behavioral problems, a \"free and appropriate education.\" In theory, this means that when a student is struggling to learn, districts must conduct assessments, create individualized plans and, if a child's needs can't be met in public schools, pay tuition for a private school - all at no cost to kids or their families.\n\nIn practice, however, what happens to students in New York City's special education system often depends on the personal resources a family brings to the table. At each step of the way - identifying a disability, creating a service plan, deciding where a child will learn and who will pay for it - a family's ability to spend its own money can secure a completely different outcome from the city's public education system.\n\nIn the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, thousands of parents tap their personal funds to send children to private schools for students with disabilities and then sue the city Department of Education to reimburse them for tuition or other services. The schools these kids attend often charge well over $100,000 a year. Many offer the trappings of elite boarding schools, with bucolic settings and promises of advanced college prep. At some, students ride horses as part of their therapy.\n\nThe city doesn't publish specific demographic data about students whose expenses are paid this way - commonly known as \"Carter cases\" after a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Florence County School District Four v. Carter, that affirmed schools had a duty to reimburse tuition in certain situations. However, Carter cases are not evenly distributed across New York City, which divides its massive school system into 32 geographical regions sometimes referred to as community school districts. Last school year , more than half of settlement agreements involved students who live in just four of the richest and whitest districts, which include neighborhoods such as Manhattan's Upper East Side and Park Slope in Brooklyn. The poorest community school districts rarely see Carter case settlement money at all.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 2,600 other kids - most of them Black or Latino and nearly all low-income - are labeled as having an \"emotional disability\" and shunted into city-run special-education schools, many of which fail across just about every measurable metric: At the schools where the city Department of Education most often places emotionally disabled kids, attendance rates are among the lowest in the city and dropout rates among the highest. By the end of high school, public school students with emotional disability classifications are far more likely to have quit school than to have graduated with a diploma, according to data provided by the New York City Independent Budget Office. Hundreds end up in juvenile justice facilities or on Rikers Island.\n\nStudents With Emotional Disabilities Were Much Less Likely to Graduate Than Students Overall\n\nEducational outcomes of New York City students in the six years after they entered the ninth grade in 2013\n\nFor every 100 students with\n\nemotional disability classifications ...\n\n44 dropped out\n\n20 were still enrolled or transferred to GED program\n\n21 got a credential or diploma not recognized by most colleges\n\n12 got a diploma recognized by most colleges\n\n3 had an unknown status\n\nFor every 100 students citywide ...\n\n13 dropped out\n\n5 were still enrolled or transferred to GED program\n\n9 got a credential or diploma not recognized by most colleges\n\n73 got a diploma recognized by most colleges\n\nThe inequities are not new. Critics have long argued that money for private tuition reimbursements should instead be invested in improving services for kids with disabilities in public schools. But the costs of Carter cases to taxpayers have grown exponentially in the past decade, with payouts reaching $918 million last year. And while the cases have historically been driven by kids with autism or learning disorders, something has shifted in recent years: Attorneys who represent students say there is an influx of young people who need private schooling because of mental health conditions. \"I'm seeing more and more kids whose anxiety has gotten more severe since COVID, or who are really behind in social skills,\" said Lauren Goldberg, a partner at The AGS Firm, which represents students in education law cases.\n\nSchool closures and other pandemic stressors have contributed to the crisis, Goldberg and other attorneys say. But even before the coronavirus arrived in New York, schools were feeling the impact of shutdowns of another kind: As THE CITY and ProPublica have reported, New York state made a deliberate choice over the past decade to eliminate hundreds of beds for children and adolescents in psychiatric hospitals and residential programs while failing to follow through on promises to dramatically expand community-based mental health care.\n\nNYC Spends 5 Times as Much on Carter Case Settlements as It Did in 2012\n\n$1 Billion\n\n750M\n\nAll other Carter case expenditures\n\n500M\n\n250M\n\nPayments to schools\n\n2012\n\n2022\n\nWhen kids can't find mental health services in their communities, the onus falls on school systems, which don't have the option to turn students away. \"As soon as the residential programs closed, those kids came to us,\" said one social worker at a New York City special education high school that serves hundreds of students with emotional disability classifications. \"The entire state of New York has shifted the burden of mental health to the school districts.\"\n\nIn a written statement to THE CITY and ProPublica, Nicole Brownstein, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education, said her agency is working to expand access to high-quality programs that allow students with disabilities to succeed in all schools. The city has invested in software that will improve assessments and service plans, has expanded programs for students with sensory and mental health needs, has conducted trainings on implicit bias, and is creating a strategic plan to support students with emotional disabilities, Brownstein said. \"We continue to work towards dismantling inequities in the special education process.\"\n\nProPublica and THE CITY have documented the stories of three New York City kids, each of whom had a very different experience navigating the school system when they had a mental health crisis. We spoke extensively to each child's mother, though not to the kids themselves; reviewed medical and educational documents; and interviewed dozens of mental health and education professionals who work with these and other students with disabilities. We also asked the city Department of Education to comment on the experiences of the two students who struggled to get the help they needed; Brownstein offered a brief statement on one. We allowed parents to decide whether and how we could identify their children. Read their stories below.\n\nGary's mom was sure that, if she didn't do something drastic, her son would wind up arrested or dead.\n\nThings had been scary for a long time. Gary was a ninth grader at a prestigious and competitive public school in Brooklyn, but he skipped class more often than he went. At the beginning of the school year, in the fall of 2018, he'd attempted suicide at least once - maybe twice, his parents still weren't sure - and spent a week in a hospital psychiatric unit, said his mom, who asked us to identify Gary by his middle name to protect his privacy.\n\nStill, it wasn't until Gary left his Instagram account open that his mom's worst fears were confirmed. She saw messages, going back for months, about using and selling hard drugs. \"My stomach dropped,\" she said. \"We have serious addiction in the family. My sister drank herself to death.\"\n\nMonths earlier, a counselor had suggested that Gary go to a residential program for kids with acute mental health conditions, but his parents had dismissed the idea. They didn't want to send their child away from home, and anyway, they knew that a good program could cost thousands of dollars a week - not the kind of money they had sitting around.\n\nNow, \"full-on desperation set in,\" said Gary's mom. She mined her network, contacting other parents of struggling teens, talking to friends of friends who were mental health professionals. She turned to her own mom and her husband's parents for help with money - a lot of it.\n\nWithin a week, she and her husband had a plan: They hired what's known as a \"youth transportation service\" - two burly guys who came to Gary's home in the middle of the night and escorted him by plane to Utah, where, at a cost of $60,000, he spent four months at a wilderness therapy program, getting sober and doing intensive individual and group therapy.\n\nSending her son away was one of the hardest things Gary's mom had ever done, she said. But there was more bad news: At the end of wilderness therapy, Gary's counselors said he still wasn't ready to come home. His mom would need to find an even longer-term program - one that could keep him safe and continue to provide treatment while letting him move forward with high school.\n\n\"They told me, 'You can't bring this kid home. He'll relapse right away,'\" Gary's mom said.\n\nTaylor Cardin had just turned 13 when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down schools across New York City, including the school she'd attended for years in Queens. Taylor is autistic, and when her routines disappeared, she panicked, said her mom, Tiffany Caldwell.\n\nTaylor stopped sleeping at night and refused to go outside during the day. She'd always been a gentle, affectionate kid, but now little things infuriated her. As the months at home dragged on, she grew aggressive with her mom, hitting and scratching Caldwell when she got upset. When her school finally opened back up in person, she refused to get off the bus, crying and lashing out at anyone who tried to help her.\n\nTaylor's doctor recommended that Caldwell take her to a psychiatrist for an evaluation. Caldwell had always thought that she had good health insurance. She'd worked for nearly 20 years for New York state's Office of Mental Health as an aide in a psychiatric hospital for adults. But when she called the list of psychiatrists in her insurance network, she found that not a single one was available to see Taylor. \"They didn't answer, or they weren't taking new patients, or, if they were, the first appointment was sometime next year,\" Caldwell said.\n\nDesperate, Caldwell paid out of pocket - \"money I didn't have,\" she said - for a session via Zoom with an out-of-network psychiatrist, who diagnosed Taylor with depression and anxiety and prescribed her a cocktail of medications that seemed to Caldwell to make everything worse. Taylor picked up new behaviors, like slamming doors and the toilet seat over and over again. \"She had this look in her eyes like she was on another planet,\" Caldwell said. Taylor's violent episodes got so bad that Caldwell had to call the police to restrain her and take her to a psychiatric emergency room. Each time, hospital staff sedated her and sent her home. \"They didn't have any beds,\" Caldwell said. \"Once, I begged them to keep her overnight. They told me, 'If you're not here in the morning, we'll call child services.' It was like a punitive thing. There's such a lack of regard and empathy and respect.\"\n\nBy the end of 2020, Taylor had been out of school for nine months. She was talking less and refusing to do basic things, like shower and get dressed. Caldwell, who raises Taylor on her own, had used up her family medical leave and was on the verge of losing both her job and her apartment. The thought of separating from her daughter broke her heart, Caldwell said, but she realized that Taylor needed a residential school: \"I was just watching my child regress every day.\"\n\nFor Davon, the problems started in elementary school. He was skinny and shy, and kids picked on him, said his mom, Latoya Patterson, who asked us not to use Davon's last name to protect his privacy. Patterson asked school officials for help, but Davon was quiet and didn't cause problems, she said, so the school ignored him until fifth grade, when he started to fight back.\n\n\"He got sick of the bullying,\" Patterson said. \"If someone did something to him, he was reactive right away.\" By middle school, Patterson was getting calls at least once a week to say that Davon had been in another fight.\n\nIn sixth grade, Davon was classified as having an emotional disturbance, a term that was formally changed in New York this year to \"emotional disability.\" An emotional disability classification is not a medical diagnosis. Rather, it's a catch-all term used by education departments for any number of mental health or behavioral challenges that show up in school. An emotionally disturbed student could be a first grader who hits other kids or a 10th grader who has psychotic episodes, or who's too persistently sad to concentrate. Critics argue that the classification is far too vague and subjective. Under federal and state regulations, for example, students can be classified as emotionally disabled for such criteria as exhibiting \"inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances.\"\n\nIn New York City, Black boys get classified with emotional disabilities at a far higher rate than other kids. In the 2020-2021 school year, the most recent for which data is available, Black students made up less than a quarter of students overall, yet they accounted for nearly half of students classified as having an emotional disability. White students, who made up 15% of all students in New York City public schools, accounted for just 8% of emotional disability classifications.\n\nThat's in part because evaluators may be more likely to interpret Black boys' behavior as aggressive, advocates and attorneys say. But it's also because white families more often come to the assessment process armed with detailed private evaluations and the knowledge that they can push for a classification that carries less potential stigma, such as \"other health impairment\" or \"multiple disabilities.\"\n\nParents \"want to get the right classification,\" said Goldberg, the education attorney. \"Colleges are going to see this. Middle and high schools are going to see this. You're thinking about your kid's future.\"\n\nPatterson, who's Black, raises Davon by herself and works as a construction laborer. She didn't know that some parents hire lawyers and paid educational advocates to represent them at special education meetings. Certainly, nobody suggested that she get Davon a private neurological or psychiatric evaluation. Instead, she participated in planning meetings, filled out paperwork and, for the most part, took Department of Education staff at their word when they said they wanted to help her son.\n\nIt was a belief that she came to regret.\n\nBy the time Gary finished wilderness therapy, his mom had spoken to plenty of parents who'd sent their kids to private schools and then sued the city to be reimbursed for the cost. She knew that success depended on hiring the right people.\n\nThe frequency with which families pursue these Carter cases has given rise, in New York City, to an elaborate ecosystem of high-priced professional advisers and advocates. Parents frequently start by paying $5,000 to an educational consultant, whose job it is to broker admission to a private school. Sought-after schools often maintain relationships with particular attorneys, who might charge a family anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 per year to pursue tuition reimbursement. In turn, attorneys may point parents to trusted psychologists, who - for another $5,000 or more - conduct detailed assessments and write reports that might support the claim that a child can't be served in public school. That's all in addition to the price of tuition, which, even if a family wins its case, may not be reimbursed for months or years.\n\nNot everyone who pursues Carter cases has hundreds of thousands of dollars on hand. It's not uncommon for parents to refinance their homes or pull cash from retirement plans to pay the deposit on a residential school that a family hopes will rescue their suicidal or addicted child. And there's no shortage of GoFundMe pages set up by families begging for help with the final $10,000 or $15,000. There are also some attorneys in New York who specialize in taking on severely disabled kids without charging a retainer, and there are private schools that reserve spots for kids whose families can't pay tuition upfront.\n\nNonetheless, the typical buy-in costs are high enough to rule out the vast majority of New York City families. \"There's a huge industry around teenage mental health, but it's only for a particular demographic of our society,\" said Gary's mom, who is white and describes her family as middle-class. \"It's so clearly unjust. At the same time, when your child is attempting suicide, you can't really get picky about diversity at the institutions you're sending them to because you need to save your kid's life.\"\n\nGary's mom had heard enough horror stories about abusive residential programs to know that she wanted professional advice on which one to choose. Based on recommendations from a friend, she hired an educational consultant who found a therapeutic boarding school in Arizona and then managed Gary's application. \"She had the relationships; she knew what to say,\" Gary's mom said.\n\nWith her in-laws' help, Gary's mom was able to cover tuition: a $25,000 deposit and then $11,000 per month. The next step was to try to get that money back from the public school system.\n\nBecause Taylor was diagnosed with autism when she was little, Caldwell had years of experience navigating New York City's special education system. She knew that most decisions go through a dedicated committee in a student's local area, which is charged with approving individualized education programs and deciding which services kids should receive. To Caldwell, those decisions often seemed arbitrary. She'd wondered why some kids seemed to get more services than others, and whether Taylor might be getting less help because she's Black.\n\nAfter schools closed down in 2020, Caldwell reached out to her local committee, but months went by with no help. \"I kept reporting, reporting, reporting: 'This child is in crisis and it's getting worse,'\" she said. \"It all fell on deaf ears.\" Some of Taylor's instructors tried to continue working with her virtually, but Taylor couldn't engage via the computer screen, so she ended up receiving nothing - no classes, no speech therapy, no contact with anyone except her mom. \"It's like we're floating around with an inner tube, and I'm yelling, 'Please! We're drowning! Help us!'\" Caldwell said.\n\nThere was no way that Caldwell could pay upfront for Taylor to go to a private boarding school - she'd never even heard of anyone who did that. Her only option was to convince the Department of Education to approve Taylor for placement at a residential school and get the agency to pay the tuition directly.\n\nThe New York State Education Department holds contracts with approximately 200 private schools - typically shorthanded as \"state-approved\" schools - that serve kids from across New York who have disabilities that affect their education, such as intellectual delays, autism or emotional disabilities. While these state-approved schools are free for families, they vary enormously in quality, according to advocates and education attorneys. Some schools have excellent reputations and get far more applicants than they can take; others have been the subject of multiple complaints and lawsuits alleging mistreatment of kids. Little information is available publicly about each school, so parents who don't have paid consultants or deep networks may have nothing to go on but online reviews.\n\nState-approved schools are also deeply segregated by race. For example, at the Queens campuses of The Summit School, which attorneys describe as being highly sought after, 70% of students were white, while just 22% were Black or Hispanic during the 2021-2022 school year, according to state data. Just a couple of miles away, at the Theresa Paplin School, which is run by a large foster care and mental health services agency, 83% of students were Black or Hispanic, while just 13% were white.\n\nGetting placed at any of these schools can be a long and circuitous process, involving multiple meetings, referrals and interviews. And even then, there's no guarantee that an appropriate school will have space. Kids sometimes wait months for a bed to open up at a therapeutic residential school on the state-approved list. In the worst cases, they cycle in and out of emergency rooms, sit in psychiatric hospitals or land in the juvenile justice system while they wait.\n\nOn her own, Caldwell couldn't even get to the first step: scheduling a meeting to review Taylor's special education plan. By the time Taylor had been out of school for close to a year, Caldwell's own health was suffering, and she was exhausted and furious. \"Children with disabilities are disregarded and pushed to the side,\" she said. \"They're treated like second-class citizens.\"\n\nIn January 2021, Caldwell found an education attorney who was willing to take Taylor's case against the Department of Education without charging an upfront fee. \"You have to fight for everything,\" she said, \"because they're not going to willingly give it to you.\"\n\nWhile many parents battle to get their kids approved for private placement, Patterson found that Davon's school was all too happy to recommend that Davon go elsewhere.\n\nThat's not unusual for kids who are seen as aggressive, education experts say. Once a student has been classified with a disability, federal law requires school districts to educate them in the least restrictive possible setting, integrated with their nondisabled peers. In reality, teachers often don't have the training to deal with kids who have repeated behavioral problems, said Kristen GoldMansour, a former teacher who works as a consultant in dozens of New York City schools.\n\nThe result is that struggling kids get punished for behaviors that are beyond their control, GoldMansour said. \"If a kid is coming in to us completely traumatized and we just keep saying, 'Sit down, pay attention, calm down,' we're not helping.\"\n\nOver time, the pressure can build up to drive difficult students out of general education schools, even if that child is academically and cognitively capable of doing grade-level work. A Brooklyn-based social worker who conducts special education evaluations, and who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions at work, described the process like this: \"My supervisor would be saying, 'Let's try a smaller class. Let's try a paraprofessional.' But the principal wants that kid out of the school immediately. It's a touchy thing.\"\n\nAt first, the special education committee that reviewed Davon's case suggested that he transfer to a special day program for kids with mental health challenges, but the waitlist was months long, so the Department of Education changed his recommendation to a state-approved residential school. To Patterson, it sounded like Davon would be placed in a specialized boarding school, with all the mental health services that she couldn't find for him at home. \"They're saying he'll get therapy,\" she recounted. \"He'll get a lot of different programs that will help him. I'm thinking this will be great.\"\n\nIt was only after Davon got to the residential school - a campus in Westchester operated by the social service agency Graham Windham - that Patterson learned that many of the students had been placed there by a judge and seemed to have far more serious behavioral and psychological problems than Davon. Sending him there \"was the worst decision I ever made,\" she said.\n\nDavon had been slightly behind his grade level when he left home; now he fell way back. Patterson said he never got the therapy he was promised because - like many mental health providers that rely on public funding - the school couldn't keep counselors on staff. \"It was like a revolving door,\" Patterson said. \"If he got two months of consistent therapy, I'd be surprised.\" She asked the special education committee if she could bring Davon home, but was told that since he'd left the system with a record of behavior problems, a community school would be unlikely to take him back.\n\nGraham Windham did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDavon started sneaking off campus with other kids and getting into increasingly serious trouble. He was arrested for being a passenger in a stolen car, and then again at the scene of a robbery, Patterson said. After he violated the curfew in his probation agreement, a judge sent him to a juvenile justice group home in Brooklyn, where he spent nine months.\n\nTo Patterson, the irony was excruciating. She had agreed to send Davon to the residential school in part because she was afraid that at home he'd end up in trouble with the police. Now she believed that the school system had put him on a direct path to the criminal justice system.\n\nIt's a common trajectory for young people with emotional disabilities, who make up close to half the students enrolled at schools in New York City's juvenile detention centers and in the Rikers Island jail, according to data from the Independent Budget Office. \"There's a school-to-prison pipeline for these kids,\" said Dawn Yuster, an attorney who directs the School Justice Project at the community group Advocates for Children.\n\nGary's therapeutic boarding school was exactly what his mom had hoped. It was small and family-run. Most of the staff had many years of experience; several were in recovery themselves. Gary got individual therapy multiple times a week, as well as evidence-based addiction treatment and full weekends of intensive family therapy. He and the other residents spent hours every day outside, taking care of horses and riding them through the desert. For years before Gary went to the program, \"our house was so sad and tense,\" his mom said. Now, \"he was free. It was the coolest thing ever, to see your kid be a cowboy.\"\n\nFrom the start, Gary's attorney was optimistic about the family's prospects of getting a tuition reimbursement. \"They won't tell you that you'll definitely win. They were like, 'You have a good case,'\" Gary's mom said. \"The suicide attempts help; making it a life-or-death situation helps.\"\n\nFrom a historical perspective, there was good reason to be hopeful. Back in the early 2000s, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg staffed up on lawyers to make it harder for parents to force the city to pay for private schools and services. In 2014, his successor, Bill de Blasio, changed tack, promising to make the settlement process easier and faster for families. The number of New York City students receiving Carter case settlements shot up, growing from less than 5,300 in 2015 to more than 17,700 in 2022, according to data provided by the Independent Budget Office. The city Department of Education declined to say what percentage of Carter case filings are successful or how many are settled without going to a hearing. But education attorneys say that they win reimbursement cases far more often than they lose.\n\nIt's unclear whether the current administration under Mayor Eric Adams will try to bring the Carter case numbers down. At an advisory meeting over the summer, New York City's schools chancellor, David Banks, infuriated some advocates by saying that private school parents had \" figured out how to game this system ,\" siphoning funds at a time when public schools are contending with massive budget cuts. At a later City Council hearing, Department of Education staffers attempted to walk that accusation back, pinning the blame instead on attorneys and consultants who've turned filing Carter cases into a business model. In response, parents and City Council members argued that families wouldn't need to resort to private schools if the city weren't so abjectly failing students with disabilities.\n\nIn the end, Gary's case didn't even go to a hearing. The city agreed to settle, reimbursing his family for $100,000 of the more than $140,000 they had paid in tuition at the therapeutic boarding school.\n\nGary came home in 2021, after 13 months at the private school, and enrolled in 11th grade at a public alternative school. He still gets hit by intense bouts of depression, his mom said. \"It's a hard road, and it probably always will be.\" But he has strategies for dealing with his illness now - a fact that his mom credits almost entirely to the excellence of the treatment he received. \"He came away with a lot of coping skills, a lot of integrity and a very clear understanding of who he is,\" she said. \"That's a testament to the quality of the program, one hundred percent.\"\n\n\"That place saved his life,\" she continued. \"The horses, the other boys, the therapists - they saved his life.\"\n\nAbout the time that Gary was flying home from Arizona, Taylor's case began to crawl its way through the New York City special education system.\n\nOn the advice of her attorney, Caldwell made a formal request that the Department of Education reevaluate Taylor and write her a new education plan. \"Taylor has regressed significantly,\" she wrote in a January 2021 email. \"I have been voicing my concern with the team for months.\"\n\nIn response, the special education committee had Caldwell fill out forms and conducted a brief social-psychological assessment by video. But more months passed, and nothing changed: There was no meeting, no plan, no new services.\n\nIn April 2021, Taylor's attorney filed a due process complaint with the Department of Education, charging that the city had failed to provide Taylor with a free and appropriate education. By law, that should have triggered what's called an \"impartial hearing\" within 30 days, but the hearing system is notoriously backlogged , and Taylor and Caldwell waited four months. (This year, the city moved impartial hearings to a new administrative office and hired 40 new hearing officers, which has reduced the standing backlog of unassigned cases from thousands to hundreds, wrote Brownstein, the city Department of Education spokesperson.)\n\nWhen Taylor's hearing finally took place, the hearing officer ruled in her favor on all counts. The Department of Education must not only consider approving her for placement in a residential school, the officer wrote, but must also immediately start providing the services she should have been receiving all along, including tutoring, counseling, and speech and occupational therapy.\n\nEven then, every step was a battle, Caldwell said. The Department of Education refused to provide in-home instruction; a request for an iPad to help Taylor communicate dragged on for months. Meanwhile, the question of Taylor's residential school placement inched forward while Taylor sat at home. Two months after the hearing officer's order, the Department of Education sent an application packet on Taylor's behalf to multiple schools on the state-approved list. Six of those schools rejected her outright, probably because of her history of aggressive behavior, the attorney told Caldwell. One school - The School at Springbrook in Oneonta, New York - offered Taylor a spot, but they were full and couldn't say how long it might take for a bed to become available.\n\nIn January, the Department of Education offered Caldwell a new option: She could send Taylor to a residential school in Pennsylvania, which had vacancies and would accept her right away. At first Caldwell was thrilled, but then she looked up online reviews for the facility and found dozens of stories referencing abuse and neglect. One reviewer alleged that her daughter had been raped by a staff member; others said their kids came home with bruises. Caldwell turned the placement down.\n\nA space finally opened up for Taylor at The School at Springbrook in April, after she'd been at home for more than two years. Taylor's thriving at the school, which uses evidence-based therapies designed for people with autism and emotional disabilities, Caldwell said. She's going on field trips, getting along with other kids and regaining some of the skills she lost. Caldwell plans to move upstate, closer to the school, because she wants Taylor to stay.\n\nBut it still hurts her to think about the time that Taylor lost, Caldwell said. \"She'll never get those two years back.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to let anyone dehumanize my daughter,\" she continued. \"She's going to get the same quality education as if she didn't have a disability. She should have the same rights as her peers. She's human. She matters.\"\n\nIronically, the juvenile justice group home was better for Davon's education than the residential school. He caught up on credits and did well in his classes, according to teachers who described him in written reports as a \"polite student\" who helped his peers with their work. By the time he left, he'd decided that he wanted to go to college and become a lawyer.\n\nStill, when it was time to come home, rather than allowing Davon to attend a general education school, the Department of Education placed him at South Richmond High School - a special education school on the south shore of Staten Island. Like all such schools in New York City, South Richmond is run by an administrative entity called District 75.\n\nAdvocates have long argued that the city places far too many students in District 75 schools, where they receive a vastly inferior education with fewer resources and little hope of graduation. More than a decade ago, a city-commissioned report found that District 75 students were more isolated than students with disabilities in any other major urban school district. \"District 75's expectations for the students that it serves need to be elevated. Its programs and supports need to be improved,\" the report said.\n\nThe Department of Education told THE CITY and ProPublica that it is working to ensure that students can receive the social and emotional support they need in all school districts. \"We cannot live in a system,\" Brownstein wrote, where \"students receiving District 75 special education services are separated physically, academically and socially from their peers.\"\n\nStill, students with emotional disability classifications are placed in special education schools at an extraordinarily high rate: In the 2020-21 school year, over 33% of students with emotional disability classifications were in District 75, according to data provided by the Independent Budget Office. And within the district, those students were heavily concentrated into just a handful of schools. At several, students with emotional disability classifications made up close to half the student body.\n\nConcentrating kids with emotional and behavioral problems into one school is a setup for failure, say parents, advocates and staff who work at the schools. \"These schools tend to be ... I don't want to say 'dumping grounds,'\" said another social worker who has spent years working in District 75 high schools with very high concentrations of students with emotional disability classifications, and who did not have permission to speak on the record. Students come in throughout the year, often directly from juvenile justice facilities or residential foster care programs. One dysregulated student can easily set off others, leading to fights and chaos that make it impossible for other students to learn, the social worker said. \"They're in fight-or-flight all of the time.\"\n\nWhile most people who work in the schools are doing their best to make positive connections with students, the social worker continued, \"We also have a number of staff who couldn't get jobs in any other school.\"\n\nAt South Richmond, where Davon was referred, nearly 60% of the school's students were classified as having an emotional disability in the 2020-21 school year, compared to less than 1% of New York City public school students overall, the Independent Budget Office data shows. (The remaining South Richmond students have other educational disabilities, such as cognitive delays.) Like other schools where the city concentrates students with emotional disability classifications, South Richmond has exceptionally high rates of chronic absenteeism - 60% of students missed 20 days or more in the 2019-20 school year - and a dropout rate that is nearly five times as high as that of high school students citywide. Every year, it is on a short list of the schools that most frequently call in police officers to respond to students in emotional crisis, according to an analysis by Advocates for Children .\n\nAfter a Daily News article highlighting problems with District 75 was published in July, New York City Mayor Eric Adams promised to improve conditions for kids with emotional disability classifications. Like several other District 75 schools, South Richmond has an on-site partnership with a mental health care agency, Brownstein wrote. This school year, the Department of Education is expanding after-school and Saturday programs for students with intensive sensory needs that affect their learning and behavior.\n\nThe city is also building on a pilot project that began in 2021, which places kindergarteners with emotional disability classifications in classrooms that are intentionally integrated with nondisabled peers. The program is now running in three classrooms, each of which has two teachers, a dedicated counselor and an occupational therapist to support students. An additional three classrooms are slated to open in January in community school districts with high numbers of referrals to District 75 schools.\n\n\"These are students who may have been on a trajectory to District 75,\" Christina Foti, the city's special education chief, told THE CITY and ProPublica. \"We are rerouting them.\"\n\nRead More\n\nTo Patterson, any changes are too little and too late. Placing Davon at South Richmond was evidence that the school system had long since given up on her son, she said. \"He felt like the classes were boring. The work was too easy. I think they just didn't expect him to graduate.\" Outside of class, Patterson continued, \"the school was chaotic. They have a lot of fights. They can't control the kids. Why are you putting a bunch of kids that get into trouble in the same place? It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nNearly as soon as he started at the school, Davon felt that he was being targeted by an assistant principal and school safety officers who knew that he had a history of being arrested. Things came to a head in May, when, according to Patterson, Davon refused to allow a school safety agent to search his bag. The school called the police, and Davon was handcuffed and eventually taken to a precinct. School officials told Patterson that Davon had marijuana in the bag and that he'd head-butted a safety agent. Davon said that the agent knocked him down when he was already in handcuffs. The Staten Island district attorney's office declined to pursue a case against Davon, Patterson said, but he was briefly assigned an attorney, who advised Patterson to get in touch with Yuster from Advocates for Children.\n\nThe Department of Education said Davon was passing classes and earning credits at South Richmond High School. \"He was offered the opportunity to participate in summer school programming for additional credit accumulation, which his family declined,\" Brownstein wrote.\n\nAfter months of letters, phone calls and meetings, Yuster helped Davon get a new education plan, which allows him to attend a general education school this year for the first time since seventh grade. \"That's what I wanted, to get him out of District 75,\" Patterson said.\n\nBut it's hard to have faith, Patterson continued, in a school system that seemed ready to throw her child away when he was in middle school. \"My son is really smart,\" she said. \"But it feels like he's never going to have a fair shot.\"\n\nClarification, Nov. 17, 2022: This story was updated to clarify that Lauren Goldberg, an education attorney, was explaining why some parents might not want an emotional disability classification for their children, not describing her own legal advice.\n\nTHE CITY will be hosting an event related to this story virtually and in person early next year.

Among the false claims on some right-wing Spanish media are stories about Harris being a Marxist â a claim that could fuel distrust in her ability to govern among Cuban and Venezuelan Americans, many of whom fled socialist regimes themselves or have family who did. Latino voting-rights activists told The New York Times that such material is â more widespread, sophisticated and complex than ever ,â a threat made more pervasive because US-based social media platforms tend to be slower than usual in taking down non-English false content.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Harris camp urges Latino Democrats to amplify Trump rally remark about âgarbageâ Puerto Rico\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nKamala Harrisâ campaign is encouraging Latino Democrats to keep voters focused on comedian Tony Hinchcliffeâs derisive remarks about Puerto Rico during Sunday nightâs Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHinchcliffe called Puerto Rico âa floating island of garbageâ and made a crass crack about Latinos who âlove making babiesâ during an appearance at the Trump rally â prompting criticism from multiple Republicans, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott and New York Rep. Anthony DâEsposito. While the comedian pushed back that his critics âhave no sense of humor,â the Trump campaign issued a statement distancing itself from his commentary.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucusâ chair, California Rep. Nanette Barragan, issued a statement quipping that âthe only garbage I saw yesterday was on that racist rally stage in Madison Square Garden.â\n\nNew York Reps. Adriano Espaillat and Nydia VelÃ¡zquez are following up Monday with a press appearance in the diverse neighborhood of East Harlem to condemn the Trump rallyâs âracist and anti-Americanâ rhetoric. A source close to the Harris campaign confirmed itâs urging Latino Democrats to keep speaking out about the Trump rally.\n\nThe mobilization by Latino Democrats signals that the party sees Hinchcliffeâs remarks potentially breaking through with undecided voters in the final week before the election, as Trump and Kamala Harris are neck and neck in most polls. Harrisâ campaign amplified the contrast between her own release of a specific plan to assist Puerto Rico hours before the Trump rally.\n\nHarris also visited a Puerto Rican restaurant Sunday during multiple stops in Philadelphia.\n\nIn addition to more than 1 million Puerto Ricans in New York, where Democrats are battling for several battleground congressional seats, the swing state of Pennsylvania counts nearly half a million Puerto Rican residents. Georgia, which Harris and Trump are also vying for, counts nearly half a million Latino residents, nearly one-fifth of whom are Puerto Rican, according to UCLAâs Latino Politics & Policy Institute.\n\nâThe racist comments at Donald Trumpâs rally in New York City were a slap in the face to millions of Puerto Ricans from the island to the mainland,â VelÃ¡zquez said in a statement to Semafor. â While the Trump campaign may claim these comments donât reflect their views, his track record is clear. Trump repeatedly attacked our island in the wake of Hurricane Maria and even contemplated selling it off.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nComedian Al Madrigal is among a group of celebrities who traveled to Washington this week to discuss issues impacting the Latino community. Ahead of a visit to the White House, the Democratic group Equis, which organized the trip, presented the group with polling showing Donald Trumpâs strong standing among Latino male voters.\n\nâThat is a little disheartening,â Madrigal told Semafor in an interview, adding that he picked up on voter discontent ahead of Trumpâs upset 2016 victory as well when he was traveling for stand-up shows. âYou know, the knock on Hollywood people is that itâs like flyover states and we only are familiar with L.A. and New York but I had spent a lot of time in most parts â Indian casinos on the Arkansas-Oklahoma border. â¦ I get a sense of where that comes from, but itâs still a little jarring.â\n\nMadrigal said he attributes Trumpâs rise among the key Democratic constituency to frustrations about the US economy that are afflicting the broader American electorate. âItâs voting with your pocketbook and looking at interest rates,â he said. âIf youâre a first-time homeowner looking at these interest rates, itâs pretty daunting.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMadrigal along with actors Jay Hernandez, Arturo Castro, and Cristo FernÃ¡ndez visited the White House Monday to talk with officials about issues like the economy, immigration, education and to participate in a Cinco de Mayo celebration.\n\nThe group participated in a Q&A with White House adviser Tom Perez, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, according to an Equis spokeswoman. They also met first lady Jill Biden and Latino White House staffers.\n\nThe visit was not political in nature, but it came as the Biden campaign ramps up its outreach to Latino voters. The campaign launched a new ad push last week to target Latino men on abortion rights, for instance, and Biden appealed to Latino voters during a stop at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix back in March. âWe have your backs and you have ours,â Biden said during the Cinco de Mayo event in the Rose Garden Monday afternoon.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, feel like they have an edge due to recent polling, which shows Trump continuing to erode Democratsâ advantage after previously making gains in 2020.\n\nâThe Hispanic vote will be decisive in November, and it is a fact that a significant percentage of Latino voters have been changing from Democrats to Republicans because they realized that they align much more with the principles and values of the Republican Party â family, freedom, patriotism, economic model, faith and a good education of our children,â Jaime Florez, the Republican National Committeeâs director for Hispanic communications, said in a statement.\n\nTrump signaled ambitious events to court Latino and Black voters but they havenât yet materialized, the Associated Press reported .\n\nLatinos are âat the center of a tug of war that could determine elections across the country,â the New York Times wrote .\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Democrats never expected this Senate primary to have such high stakes\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSILVER SPRING, Md. â On Wednesday afternoon, nine Latino Democrats gathered outside the Veterans Plaza polling place here to explain how a 68-year-old white congressman had won their vote.\n\nThey trusted Rep. David Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine; they didnât trust Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince Georgeâs County executive. She took Latinos âfor granted,â protected âracist police,â and didnât work quickly to end âracistâ immigration enforcement policies. Alsobrooks, who if elected would be Marylandâs first Black female senator, didnât celebrate diversity like Trone did.\n\nâItâs important to him,â said Celina Benitez, the mayor of Mount Rainier. âWhy else would you have so many elected officials, of varied diversity, here supporting him?â\n\nTwo hours later, four former state Democratic Party chairs came to the same plaza, warning that Trone had gone too negative and that non-white Democrats might struggle to support him.\n\nâItâs really difficult,â said former chair Susie Turnbull, referring to an incident when Trone meant to use the word âbugabooâ but said a racial slur instead , apologizing immediately. âHis excuses for things have been apologies with a âbut.â Using a term that is horrendous, and then you say âIâd never used that word before?â Heâs my age. I know heâs heard that word before.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMarylandâs Democratic primary is the most expensive in the country, thanks almost entirely to Trone; heâs sunk $61.8 million into this race, after spending tens of millions of dollars on four House campaigns, blanketing airwaves and YouTube with his Horatio Alger story. Alsobrooks, who went on the air in February, has spent a tenth as much.\n\nAt a Tuesday night rally at Silver Springâs AFI movie theater, where California Rep. Adam Schiff praised Troneâs âunderstanding of our economyâ and ability to âdefend our democracy,â Troneâs ads played on the big screen while a few dozen voters took their seats â so many that over 15 minutes of âI approved this messageâ-ing, no ad was played twice.\n\nYet the race remains close. Its final weeks have become an increasingly personal, tense contest between candidates battling over intertwined issues around race and who is best positioned to defend what until recently had been considered a safe seat.\n\nRepublicans havenât won here since 1980, and the Donald Trump-led GOP is practically designed to lose in Maryland: Montgomery and Prince Georgeâs counties, D.C. suburbs that cast nearly a million votes in 2020, gave less than 150,000 of them to Trump.\n\nBut the surprise decision by popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate anti-Trump Republican, has turned the general into a tossup. For the Democrats, thatâs exponentially increased the stakes of their primary.\n\nâHoganâs entrance ended our complacency about the fall election,â said Rep. Jamie Raskin, who has endorsed Alsobrooks, and beat Trone in 2016 to win his safe Montgomery County seat. (Trone got to Congress by spending $18 million in the neighboring, competitive 8th District.)\n\nSince Hoganâs entrance in February, Trone has made his personal fortune a centerpiece of his pitch: If he wins the nomination, Democrats wonât have to spend cash in Maryland that theyâd earmarked for Ohio, Montana, or other competitive states.\n\nâIt will give them a lot more flexibility to spend money elsewhere,â Trone told Semafor on Tuesday. âIâm sure that will appeal to Leader Schumer.â\n\nThe deep-pockets argument, along with Troneâs years of party donations and go-everywhere campaigning, helped him win over many Democrats who repeat his argument: He has more relevant experience than Alsobrooks, and he can win. But most of the stateâs congressional delegation has stuck with Alsobrooks, confident that Hoganâs support will fade by November and wary of once again telling Black voters â who make up a third of the stateâs electorate â that itâs not their turn yet.\n\nMaryland Democrats previously rejected Black candidates when Senate seats opened up 2006 and 2016 â agonizing about it the whole time, then winning the general anyway. Neither of those races divided elected Democrats like this; Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, the winners in those years, had most of the establishment behind them. But Gov. Wes Moore, the first Black Marylander to hold that office, endorsed Alsobrooks six months ago; Adrienne Jones, the first Black female state House Speaker, beat him to it.\n\nMoore told Semafor that the electability concerns about Alsobrooks, who has out-raised Hogan, were misplaced: âRegardless of what happens in a primary, every single one of us are going to be all in to make sure that our nomineeâ wins the race.\n\nAlsobrooks goes further, suggesting she may be better positioned to unite the partyâs diverse wings come the general.\n\nâWhatâs going to be needed is a coalition of people from all backgrounds who will come together to defeat Larry Hogan,â Alsobrooks told Semafor after stopping to talk to voters at an early voting site in Bowie. âIâm the person who has the experience of doing that.â The evidence that Troneâs wealth wasnât insurance against a Hogan win, she said, was that Trone had outspent her all year, and sheâd closed the gap.\n\nTrone, for his part, has consistently highlighted support from non-white and female Democrats in his omnipresent TV spots; Black men whoâd benefited from his investments in criminal justice reform, women of all races who were helped by his support for family planning. He could even get to the county executiveâs left on some issues. Trone had always opposed the death penalty; Alsobrooks would only say, passively, that Maryland had banned it.\n\nThe candidates didnât disagree on much else, so Alsobrooksâs supporters homed in on how Trone â and his surrogates âÂ talked. In March, after Prince Georgeâs County Council Member Ed Burroughs said in one Trone ad that the Senate was not a job for people with âtraining wheels,â more than 600 Black women co-signed a letter that denounced its âtones of misogyny and racism.â\n\nThat comment was struck from the ad, but the attention hurt Trone. In Silver Spring, pressed on the âtraining wheelsâ quote, Trone noted that he didnât say it in the ad; when a reporter pointed out that Trone had used the same phrase, the candidate said that âwe stand by the fact that Burroughs made the comment, and, frankly, she doesnât have the experience at the federal level.â What mattered, he explained, was what he was going to do with the Senate seat.\n\nâI have supported wonderful women and diverse candidates all over this country, and will continue to do so,â Trone said. âBut what the voters keep saying, time and time again, is look at what I can do for you.â\n\nBut as early voting wrapped up, Troneâs non-white surrogates kept saying what heâd been told not to say: Alsobrooks wasnât ready for the job, or sensitive enough to other non-white Democrats. âWe need someone who can be effective from day one,â Prince Georgeâs County Stateâs Attorney Aisha Braveboy said on Thursday, when pro-Trone Democrats gathered at a union hall to support him to argue that voters needed to look past the candidatesâ race.\n\nâI wouldnât vote for Candace Owens, no matter what she was running for,â said Krystal Oriadha, another county council member whoâd rejected Alsobrooks. âThe idea that we just have to vote for someone because of their gender, because of their color, negating any other issues, is insulting to us as a community.â (Owens is a high-profile Black conservative pundit.)\n\nOn the stump, Alsobrooks didnât lead with her race or gender â and didnât really need to. âShe would certainly make history, but more importantly, she will make a difference,â Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock told reporters after a meeting with the candidate and Black pastors, redirecting a question about race to talk about the investments made by the Democratic Senate.\n\nâMy basic thought is positive politics, high road politics is what wins in Maryland,â Raskin said, asked about the challenges of facing the self-funding Trone. âIâve told that to all the candidates. I think that that is the way to go.â\n\nPat Moran, a Democrat who voted for Alsobrooks this week, said she was drawn to the candidate because of her experience fighting crime in the county. âYou know what the crime is like; itâs off the chain,â she said. But the candidateâs identity mattered, too. âWe need an African American in the Senate. We do need a balance of power in the Senate.â\n\nNagender Madavaram, an engineer who was supporting Trone, said that he made his mind up after watching the Democrat bring money back to Maryland and make his own charitable donations to good causes. âHeâs allocated $300,000 to protect the rights of Muslims,â Madavaram said, âeven though he married a Jewish lady. Heâs a great guy. He never hesitated.â\n\nâThe Trone-Alsobrooks primary has quickly become the nastiest in the country,â said NRSC Spokesman Tate Mitchell. âMeanwhile, Governor Hogan has been traveling Maryland with a positive vision for bringing change to Washington. Larry Hogan remains overwhelmingly popular in the state, and itâs clear Marylanders are eager to see him represent them in the Senate.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is firmly ahead of Donald Trump among Hispanic voters by thirteen percentage points, according to a new poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos. She still lags behind US President Joe Bidenâs margin over Trump in 2020, however âÂ Biden won 65% of the Latino vote compared to 32% for Trump.\n\nThe poll shows Hispanic voters favor Harrisâ approach on climate change and healthcare compared to Trumpâs âÂ by 23 and 18 points respectively â and that they favor each candidate equally on the economy, with each polling at 39% favorability.\n\nThe new poll reflects dramatic improvements for Democrats now Harris is the candidate compared to Bidenâs polling prior to dropping out the race , which showed his favorability among Latinos had dwindled. Meanwhile, Trump continues to poll more favorably than Harris in certain policy areas, particularly immigration.\n\nWhile most US voters still tend to favor Trump over Harris on the economy, Hispanic and Latino Americans represent a key voter constituency for Democrats.

      "text": "Hispanic leaders warn Democrats: Voters are fed up with Biden\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Joe Biden is heading into 2024 with concerning numbers among Hispanic voters: A new USA Today/Suffolk survey shows him trailing Donald Trump by five percentage points, with many reluctant to back either candidate. While itâs an especially rough poll, others have also shown him struggling to match his 2020 numbers with a key swath of the Democratic base âÂ and Hispanic leaders say theyâre seeing the same problems on the ground.\n\nâItâs a matador red flag flying out there âÂ the Hispanic vote is totally up for grabs,â Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, told Semafor. â[Trumpâs] cutting the margins. And in battleground states like Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, that can be a big difference.â\n\nConversations with leaders of Hispanic groups and political consultants in both parties underscored Bidenâs difficult path forward. His challenges with Hispanic voters are not dissimilar to his problems with the broader electorate: Dissatisfaction over inflation, concerns about record-high border crossings, and lack of excitement over his policy accomplishments. And even as he works to shore up border security with a potential bipartisan deal in Congress, members of his own party warn he could also lose support in November if an agreement ends up being perceived as overly hostile to immigrant communities.\n\nGarcia told Semafor that the âfear of a second Trump presidencyâ and the prospect of dramatically stepped-up deportations remains an asset for Biden, especially with women. But the president still hasnât figured out how to package his presidency in an appealing way.\n\nâTheyâre lacking a core message and right now Latino voters are really concerned about economics â inflation has eaten away at their paycheck, the cost of rentâ¦ trying to buy a house seems to be more elusive than ever,â he said.\n\nJavier Palomarez, president and CEO of the United States Hispanic Business Council â a leading advocate for Hispanic-owned firms across the U.S. â criticized the administrationâs triumphal âBidenomicsâ push, arguing itâs not reflective of what people on the ground are actually experiencing.\n\nâI understand their need to create a narrative and to drive that narrative. Itâs a tried and true strategy that has worked for administration after administration, campaign after campaign,â Palomarez said. âBut the narrative theyâre building is one that is a bit tone-deaf to whatâs actually happening in the Hispanic community â and Iâm not even saying that theyâre incorrect.â\n\nPalomarez added that heâs had several conversations with White House advisors heading into 2024: The discussion, according to him, is normally âa healthy debate about how theyâre right and weâre wrong.â\n\nTayde Aburto, president of the Hispanic Chamber of e-Commerce, is based in Southern California, which is still a Democratic bastion. But he warned he was hearing rising concerns from business owners and voters this cycle about cost-of-living issues like housing as well as public safety â concerns that Democrats needed to confront them head on.\n\nâI can sense that there is discontent, or theyâre not that confident that another four years of the current administration is gonna get us out of the issues that weâre dealing with,â Aburto told Semafor.\n\nAnd while Florida is increasingly falling off the electoral map, Julio Fuentes, president and CEO of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said Biden should still be worried that even some âhardcore Democratsâ seem increasingly fed up with his performance on the economy and border issues.\n\nâ[Biden] did have a good percentage of the Hispanic vote here in Florida on his first go-around,â he said, âbut you just see that dwindling, literally on a weekly basis.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBiden faces a more aggressive Republican Party, which has worked harder in recent years to recruit Hispanic candidates, run up the score in conservative-trending areas like Florida, and challenge previous Democratic strongholds in places like Texas (with mixed results in the midterms). And while Trump has struggled with Hispanic voters overall, he made significant strides between 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut Bidenâs struggles with Hispanic voters donât automatically mean Trump will get their support. Hispanic leaders I spoke with highlighted how voters are dissatisfied with both options âÂ and that the 2024 election could be a âhold your noseâ type voting situation, if voters decide to turn out at all.\n\nIn a way, thatâs a red flag for team Trump, too: The USA Today/Suffolk survey found that a number of voters said theyâd back someone besides the two leading candidates. Recent polling by Quinnipiac found Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running especially well with Hispanic voters, attracting 33% of their support in a three-way matchup. But third party support often fades closer to election day and itâs still hard to predict where those voters might break.\n\nâThe equal dissatisfaction for both of the leading presidential candidates has Hispanics opting out of party affiliation, and that should be a concern,â Palomarez told me. âHispanics are going to vote for the person and his policies, not the party. And so neither party should be taking that for granted.â\n\nStill, this trend away from Biden is an opportunity for team Trump, who has honed in on how voters feel about the economy in a way that the Biden campaign has not.\n\nMassey Villarreal, chairman of the Texas Association of Business, told Semafor that as of now, Trump has a real opportunity to come out on top. The migrant influx in the state and economic concerns are in some ways linked, he noted: Many Hispanics in Texas are âup in armsâ after U.S. Customs and Border Protection temporarily suspended operations at two railway bridges due to the border crisis, for example.\n\nâAll that Trump would have to do is run a campaign about who shut down your job,â he said. âI mean, itâs gonna be pointed at Joe Biden.â\n\nMatt Barreto, a Democratic Party advisor , maintained that once the Biden campaignâs messaging fully sinks in with voters, the poll numbers will begin changing for the better as âfrustratedâ voters hear more from him.\n\nâWhat we have seen is when you talk to those folks who maybe had supported Biden in â20 and are telling people theyâre undecided now âÂ theyâre horrified of Trump. Thereâs almost no chance theyâre going to vote for Trump,â he told Semafor. âIf the campaign continues to emphasize contrast, and Bidenâs accomplishments, then I think â¦in the battleground states where it matters, the average Latino voter is going to be well informed and theyâre going to say, this is a serious election.â\n\nTeam Biden says they arenât taking Hispanic voters for granted: Theyâve launched multiple ads, earlier than ever, over the past few months targeting Latino voters, and have already begun programs focused on key voting groups in battleground states.\n\nâA second Trump presidency would be a disaster for our community,â Maca Casado, the Hispanic Media Director for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. âThe MAGA platform stands against Latinosâ support for good jobs, quality health care, and protecting our hard-fought freedoms. The stakes of this election couldnât be higher for us which is why our campaign is investing earlier and more than ever into mobilizing Latinos well ahead of the election. We are encouraged by the consistent, strong support weâve seen from Latinos across our battlegrounds in the midterms and look forward to continue proving the same pundits and polls wrong again next November.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "How We Chose the 2024 Latino Leaders\n\nVaya abajo de la página para leer este artículo en español.\n\nLatinos have always been a part of the fabric of America-indigenous to the continent and a continuously growing proportion of the national population.\n\nToday, one in five people in the U.S. identifies as Latino. It's the country's largest racial or ethnic minority group, according to the Census Bureau -and it's expected to grow from 65 million people to over 111 million by 2060.\n\nLatinos' influence on politics, culture, and all of society is undeniable-which is why TIME inaugurated a list last year during Hispanic Heritage Month to spotlight Latino Leaders, inspiring figures who are reshaping their industries and the world.\n\nThis year, we're highlighting 17 more U.S.-based trailblazers -from Hollywood to Washington, D.C., and everywhere in between. We chose the group based on the significance of their work and the diversity of their perspectives.\n\nSome, including Olympic gymnast Hezly Rivera and singer María Zardoya of the Marías, are on their way to stardom and proud to represent their community. Others, like Sundance Film Festival director Eugene Hernandez and Estée Lauder executive Michelle Freyre , have made their way to the top and are intent on turning their visibility into opportunity for the next generation. \"I do know that now they can look at me,\" Freyre says. \"But I have to go and pull them up with me and make that ­happen.\"\n\nUnfortunately, as Mexican former diplomat and marketing mastermind Claudia Romo Edelman says she discovered, being Latino in the U.S. can come with a stigma that needs to be overcome-which is why she has dedicated herself to rebranding Latinos as the positive contributors that they are. Edelman isn't the only honoree on this year's list working to shift perception. Comedian George Lopez remembers seeing his grandfather discriminated against by a restaurant server. That moment angered him, and it fueled a passion to use humor and his own depictions of family life to transform the story of Latinos in America from one of trauma into one of resilience.\n\n\"People have kind of put Latina characters in a box,\" says actor Aubrey Plaza , who like fellow actors Camila Mendes and Wilson Cruz has sought to infuse Latino identity into her roles. But it's impossible to navigate everyone else's expectations. \"If you stick to being authentic to yourself,\" says Mendes, \"then you can't really go wrong.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment social media influencer Tefi Pessoa -who like many young Latinos has faced criticisms of not being Latino enough , whether for the language they choose to speak publicly or where they're from-can relate to. \"I think that if my ancestors met me,\" says Pessoa, \"they would like me, and I think they would want me to be proud of where I came from.\"\n\nRead the full list of 2024 Latino Leaders here\n\nLos latinos siempre han formado parte del tejido de Estados Unidos-indígenas del continente y una proporción en continuo crecimiento de la población nacional.\n\nHoy en día, una de cada cinco personas en los EE.UU. se identifica como latina. Es el grupo racial o étnico más grande del país, según la Oficina del Censo -y se espera que crezca de 65 millones de personas a más de 111 millones para el 2060.\n\nLa influencia de los latinos en la política, la cultura y toda la sociedad es innegable-por lo que TIME inauguró una lista el año pasado durante el Mes de la Herencia Hispana para destacar a los Líderes Latinos, figuras inspiradoras que están remodelando sus industrias y el mundo.\n\nEste año, estamos destacando a 17 más pioneros basados en EE.UU. -desde Hollywood hasta Washington, D.C., y en todos los rincones intermedios. Elegimos al grupo en función de la importancia de su trabajo y la diversidad de sus perspectivas.\n\nAlgunos, incluidos la gimnasta olímpica Hezly Rivera y la cantante María Zardoya de The Marías, están en camino hacia la estrellato y se enorgullecen de representar a su comunidad. Otros, como el director del Festival de Cine de Sundance Eugene Hernandez y la ejecutiva de Estée Lauder Michelle Freyre , han llegado a la cima y están decididos a convertir su visibilidad en una oportunidad para la próxima generación. \"Sé que ahora pueden mirarme,\" dice Freyre. \"Pero tengo que ir y levantarlos conmigo y hacer que eso suceda.\"\n\nDesafortunadamente, como dice la ex diplomática mexicana y experta en marketing Claudia Romo Edelman , ser latino en EE.UU. puede venir con un estigma que debe ser superado-por lo que se ha dedicado a rebranding a los latinos como los contribuyentes positivos que son. Edelman no es la única galardonada en la lista de este año que trabaja para cambiar la percepción. El comediante George Lopez recuerda haber visto a su abuelo discriminado por un servidor de restaurante. Ese momento lo enfureció y avivó una pasión por usar el humor y sus propias representaciones de la vida familiar para transformar la historia de los latinos en América de una de trauma a una de resiliencia.\n\n\"La gente ha puesto a los personajes latinos en una caja,\" dice la actriz Aubrey Plaza , quien, al igual que las actrices Camila Mendes y Wilson Cruz , ha buscado infundir la identidad latina en sus papeles. Pero es imposible navegar las expectativas de los demás. \"Si te mantienes auténtico a ti mismo,\" dice Mendes, \"entonces realmente no puedes fallar.\"\n\nEs un sentimiento con el que la influencer en redes sociales Tefi Pessoa -quien, al igual que muchos jóvenes latinos, ha enfrentado críticas por no ser suficientemente latina, ya sea por el idioma que elige hablar públicamente o por dónde es originaria-puede relacionarse. \"Creo que si mis ancestros me conocieran,\" dice Pessoa, \"les agradaría y creo que querrían que estuviera orgullosa de dónde vengo.\"\n\nLea la lista completa de los Líderes Latinos 2024 aquí\n\n-Reportando en español por Israel Meléndez Ayala\n\nWrite to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com"

      "text": "These Latino Leaders Are Reshaping Their Industries-and the Country\n\nTIME is featuring prominent U.S.-based Latino leaders across industries who are making an impact on Hollywood, Washington, D.C., and everywhere in between.\n\nLatinos-who are by no means a monolith but, as a collective, represent one of the fastest-growing demographic groups in the country-are reshaping every aspect of American society. Today, nearly 1 in 5 people in the U.S., or more than 63 million people, identifies as Hispanic or Latino , according to the U.S. Census, and by 2060 the number of Latinos in the U.S. is projected to almost double.\n\nRead on for profiles of the people TIME has chosen to spotlight as influential Latino leaders in government, fashion, sports, culture, business, and more-a cohort that, naturally, has continued to grow.\n\nInaugurated during Hispanic Heritage Month in September, the first group of eight inspiring individuals highlighted by TIME included veteran labor champion Dolores Huerta, who has been at the forefront of civil rights advocacy for decades, as well as Julio Rodríguez, a rising baseball star who has already broken a number of records and is just getting started. Four more leaders were added in October, including Sol Trujillo, who sees Latinos as the backbone of the U.S. economy and is investing in Latino-run businesses, and Eva Longoria, who is injecting Latino perspectives and stories into mainstream entertainment. And four more rounded out the list in November, including country singer Frank Ray, who is helping to redefine what the genre looks and sounds like, and Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar, who is working to ensure Latinos' voices are heard in politics.\n\nJharrel Jerome has had a good year. He joined the Marvelverse, voicing Miles G. Morales in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse . He starred as Cootie, a 13-foot-tall teenager , in Boots Riley's first television show, I'm a Virgo . He played the impulsive Aked in the Steven Soderbergh-directed series Full Circle . And he is making a name for himself in the music industry, too: since the end of August, he's been releasing \"packs\": sets of four songs-rap, trap, R&B, and trippy-that will add up to a 16-track project, Someone I'm Not .\n\nJerome, who is Dominican and Haitian, is perhaps best known for his work on the 2016 movie Moonlight and the 2019 show When They See Us , for which he won the Best Actor Emmy. At 26, he has already built an impressive career by being intentional about the roles he picks. \"My goal is to be meticulous and to make sure that the next project is just as challenging and just as weird,\" he says. \"That's not an easy thing to do, and especially as an actor of color: That's even harder to do because roles for us don't come every day, especially roles with such impact and such gravitas.\"\n\nComing up next, Jerome's character in Spider-Man is slated to play a major role in the final installment in the trilogy, though it was delayed due to the writers' and actors' strikes, and a new release date has not yet been announced.Jerome says he aspires to be patient, diligent, and tireless as an artist, like fellow multi-hyphenate creative Donald Glover. He hopes his work portrays \"the idea of no limitations and the idea that you could be from the hood, you could have darker skin, and you can still be allowed to do whatever you wanted to do, as long as you're focused enough,\" he says. \"I don't ever want to come off as the guy who does whatever just to do it. I want to come off as the guy who challenges himself, who does the hard work.\" -Laura Zornosa\n\nLatinos may be the sleeping giant of American politics, and as founding president and CEO of Voto Latino, Maria Teresa Kumar is laser-focused on how to make their voices heard in government.\n\nKumar, 49, emigrated from Colombia as a child when her mother accompanied Kumar's American stepfather to the U.S. for medical treatment and moved in with his family in Sonoma County, Calif. \"When my grandparents saw my mother, the only interaction they had ever [had] really with a brown woman was the field hands,\" she recalls. So while her father was convalescing, \"they sent my mother to work in the fields. And I share that, because that was the first time I became political.\" Kumar worked on Capitol Hill and attended Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before deciding she wanted to devote her career to empowering and registering Latino voters. \"Young children, before they turn 18 years old, are navigating America, both in the spaces of the broader society, but also internally at home on behalf of their parents and their families,\" she says. \"My journey has always been navigating these two worlds, representing my family, but also trying to translate to the broader community who we are.\"\n\nKumar joined Voto Latino in 2004 to mobilize that rising population of voters. \"Oftentimes when people do politics, they basically say, 'Well, how many voters do we have today?'\" she said. \"The way we did Voto Latino is, I identified the states where Latinos could have been only 3% to 4% of the population to vote, but they were at least 15 to 20% of the classrooms.\" While Voto Latino is a national organization, it focuses on the states with big populations of young Latinos who are poised to grow into a powerful voting bloc, like Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia; every 30 seconds, she says, a Latino person in the U.S. turns 18.\n\nThough it isn't aligned with a political party, Voto Latino, which by 2016 had collected 177,000 voter registrations, tends to endorse Democratic candidates. But when Trump was elected on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric, Kumar knew she had to redouble the group's outreach efforts. Over the course of the Trump presidency, she says, it registered more than 1 million young voters.Latinos are now the country's second-biggest voting bloc, but with polls showing that some Latino voters may be drifting toward Republicans, Kumar and her team are taking all the strategies they've tried in previous elections-from celebrity appearances to social media campaigns to digital organizing-and putting them together for 2024. They aim to register half a million voters ahead of the presidential election. \"We are on the precipice of massive change,\" Kumar says. -Charlotte Alter\n\nThe southern border of the United States has long influenced the music of Francisco Gomez, known professionally as Frank Ray. When he served as a police officer for a decade in his home state of New Mexico, Ray would sing at local venues with his cousin and two friends in their band Border Avenue. As the group garnered greater attention, he left the force to pursue music full-time, emerging as a rising star among a new generation of Latino artists who are unapologetically embracing their roots and expanding what the mainstream country genre looks and sounds like.\n\n\"Had I not grown up so close to the border, I might not have been exposed to that part of my culture, which is something that has shaped me as a man and as an artist,\" says Ray, 36. \"I was always surrounded by the culture, always surrounded by different music, whether it was mariachi, Tejano music, cumbia, rancheras, and of course country music.\"\n\nRay released his first EP, Different Kind of Country , in 2017 and his self-titled debut album in 2021, from which multiple songs landed on U.S. country charts. And in September, he released an EP, titled Raíces (Así Se Hace) , of Spanish-language covers of several of his hit songs.\n\nThroughout his career, Ray has used his platform to shine a light on issues that matter to him. He launched a nationwide campaign earlier this year to support the mental health of first responders. And both in and out of his music, he's pushed back on political demagoguery against immigrants and Latinos. His latest single, \"Jesus at the Taco Truck,\" a collaboration with singer-songwriter and producer Shy Carter, is a lyrical tribute to a character who crossed the Rio Grande to work in Texas in order to support his family in Mexico.\"This music genre isn't known for its Latin representation,\" he says. \"I think the most important part of being an artist today is how I'm able to provide a voice to people who are from my culture that love country music.\" -Moises Mendez II\n\nCarla Vernón, CEO of The Honest Company, did not always see herself going into business. Her lifelong quest-inspired by her two Ph.D.-achieving parents (her mom Cynthia is a NASA Hidden Figure)-was to make the world a better place. At first, Vernón, whose father immigrated from Panama to attend college in the U.S., pursued that through a degree in ecology from Princeton and stints at The Nature Conservancy and as a Senate staffer. She says her path to the private sector was inspired by personal mentors, including former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun and former First Lady Michelle Obama, who showed her that there was room in any industry for Black and brown leaders to make a difference. She then spent more than two decades rising to executive positions at General Mills and Amazon.\n\n\"I've always been confident that I like to help others do things that are big-impact,\" says Vernón, 53. Vernón's newest role-as the first Afro-Latina CEO of a publicly traded company-means helping actress and fellow mother Jessica Alba, who co-founded Honest with the goal of sourcing clean, naturally derived products for women and infants. It's a mission that immediately appealed to Vernón. Honest was \"built by people who the largest consumer-products companies are trying to serve, but who aren't necessarily in the leadership seat,\" she says, and helming such a company comes with a unique power to see needs that may have previously been ignored.Following a slump after early-pandemic demand subsided, Honest has seen record-breaking revenues since Vernón took charge at the start of the year. \"When I came to Honest,\" she says, \"I wanted to build the company I always would have wanted to work for.\" -Haley Weiss\n\nAs a child growing up in South Texas, Eva Longoria noticed that most of the movies and books she encountered bore little resemblance to her own experiences. She knew even back then that she wanted to uplift the Latino community through storytelling, but she was navigating the complexities of her own identity and didn't really have a model. \"I straddled the heights of what it means to be Mexican American,\" Longoria, 48, says. \"Growing up, I almost felt like I wasn't from anywhere.\"\n\nWhen she moved to Los Angeles in the '90s, she realized the entertainment industry had a rigid idea of what Latinas should look and sound like. Producers would often rely on old tropes and tell her that her accent wasn't Spanish enough for her to be cast as Latina. It wasn't until 2004, when she starred as Gaby Solis in Desperate Housewives , that she finally had her breakthrough. The show's enormous success, spanning eight seasons, made Longoria a household name. But it was also what prompted her to think beyond delivering lines written by others.\n\nThis year, she made her directorial debut with Flamin' Hot , a biopic about the story of a former janitor at Frito-Lay who made an indelible mark on the company by pitching the idea of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. His journey resonated with Longoria, and she assembled a predominantly Latino team to bring the film to life. \"Hollywood defines what a hero looks like, and I wanted to take the reins of that and say a hero looks like Richard Montañez,\" she says. That isn't her only recent project elevating Latino stories: her six-part docuseries Searching for Mexico , in which she traveled across Mexico exploring the country's cuisine, premiered in March. She also runs her own foundation to help Latinas build better futures for themselves and their families through education and entrepreneurship, and in 2014, she co-founded the Latino Victory Fund, a political action committee to boost Latino political participation and raise money for candidates. \"I've gotten some pushback for my political advocacy,\" she says, \"but these issues are way more important to me than how much box office I would get at a movie theater.\"\n\nStill, even with her success, she knows better than to get complacent. \"We don't get a lot of bites at the apple,\" Longoria says of being a Latina working in Hollywood. \"We have so much pressure to succeed on so many levels with every project that we do, because if one fails, then it's going to be a long time until they make another one.\" -Nik Popli\n\nOn any given week, you've likely watched something Cesar Conde has touched. Conde, 49, runs NBCUniversal News Group, the most viewed news organization in the United States. The businesses Conde oversees-NBC News, MSNBC, NBC's streaming service NBC News Now, the business channel CNBC, 43 local stations, and Telemundo's many Spanish-language broadcast businesses-reach 2 in 3 American adults, including 95% of Hispanic TV households in the U.S.\n\nConde grew up in Miami and South Florida surrounded by the sounds of his mother's Cuban-accented Spanish and eating ceviche and quinoa dishes inspired by his father's childhood in Peru. Given that we live in such an interconnected time, being able \"to walk in different worlds and speak different languages and cross different cultures, I do think is a superpower,\" Conde says.\n\nEarly in his career, Conde worked for an Internet startup and an investment bank, before joining Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's office as a White House fellow in the early 2000s. The two clicked. Powell encouraged Conde to work in a business that also provided a public service to his community, like Hispanic media. Conde did, eventually rising to be the president of Univision Networks before joining NBCUniversal in 2013.\n\nUnder Conde's watch, MSNBC has passed CNN in ratings and is closing the gap with Fox News, NBC News Now built a profitable news streaming service where others have faltered, and the Today show has expanded its lead as the No. 1 weekday morning program on TV. He's done that while launching an effort to bring in more diverse voices and educate the next generation of news leaders, which he says is key to the broadcaster's future. \"At the end of the day, this is not just the right thing to do,\" says Conde, \"it's the right thing to do for our business.\" -Brian Bennett\n\nWithout Latinos, says business executive Sol Trujillo , the U.S. might look a lot like Japan-an aging society with little opportunity for economic or population growth. Instead, he says, Latinos are helping the U.S. add people, jobs, and businesses. It's one reason that Trujillo founded, in 2010, the Latino Donor Collaborative, a nonprofit that seeks to reshape the nation's perception of Latinos.\n\nTrujillo, 71, returned to the U.S. in 2009 after working abroad and says he was taken aback by the many negative portrayals of Latinos in American culture. What Americans should realize, he says, is that many countries in Europe and Asia \"don't have a growth cohort inside their economy. We have one, and it's called the Latino cohort,\" he says. \"But what are we doing to stimulate it? The answer is basically nothing.\"\n\nIn 2019, Trujillo attempted to remedy this by launching L'Attitude Ventures, a venture-capital firm that invests exclusively in Latino-run businesses. Trujillo, who traces his roots in America back 500 years, also launched L'Attitude, an annual conference that celebrates the potential of Latinos in the U.S. economy.\n\nTrujillo has been instrumental in gathering data that proves how big a role Latinos play in the U.S. economy-$2.8 trillion in economic output, according to the most recent report from the Latino Donor Collaborative-and he's determined to put those numbers to use. He's pushing for companies to put more Latinos on boards and in senior management positions, and for more venture capitalists to invest in Latino-led businesses. \"If we want to stay ahead of China, the No. 1 economy in the world, this is our silver bullet,\" he says. - Alana Semuels\n\nBefore becoming a model, singer, and actor, Laith Ashley was a social worker for homeless LGBTQ+ youth at the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City. A Dominican American from Harlem, New York, he came out as transgender in 2013, and after photos he posted on Instagram went viral in 2015, a newfound career took off. He was one of the first openly transgender male models to appear in a national fashion campaign (for Barneys in 2014), the first openly transgender man to be featured in a Diesel campaign (photographed by David LaChapelle in 2018), and the first transgender member of the pit crew on RuPaul's Drag Race . He's also appeared in magazines from Vogue France to British GQ as well as music videos by the likes of Kim Petras and Icona Pop.\n\nBut it hasn't been easy. Ashley, now 34, proudly defies stereotypes, refusing to conform to a casting director's image of who he should be. \"In their mind, Latine looks a particular way,\" he says. \"if you don't fit that box of what they think it looks like, then that becomes difficult.\"\n\nAshley appeared earlier this year as Taylor Swift's love interest in her \"Lavender Haze\" music video. Such an opportunity has made the careers of other models. But for Ashley, the experience, which he says he is grateful for, coincided with a wave of anti-trans sentiment and legislation across the United States. Brands like Bud Light and Target have faced pointed backlash for working with or supporting the LGBTQ+ community. \"Usually, the time of year when I make most of my income is during Pride [month],\" he says, but this year, \"I made nothing.\"\n\nStill, Ashley says he won't stop working on his craft. In particular, he hopes that a show he worked on called Unconventional -a comedy series that had trouble finding a home reportedly because streamers were concerned with its many LGBTQ+ characters and themes-will eventually be released somewhere. If people can see that show, Ashley says, they will be able to \"see me.\" -Moises Mendez II\n\nElizabeth Acevedo's love of storytelling started decades before she became a bestselling author and the Young People's Poet Laureate. It began in the classroom, during her time as a student and later on as an English teacher, where she grasped the significance of having Latino representation in literature.\n\n\"I read anything and everything put in front of me, but it was different when I read a book about someone who was from a city, from a big family, trying to navigate gender, race, and language, because there was an affirmation of who I was in those books,\" says Acevedo, 35, a Dominican American raised in New York City. She decided she could contribute to that canon: \"I had to face the questions of inaccuracy I had around who is allowed to write a book and thought, 'Why not me?'\"\n\nAcevedo has since published three notable young-adult novels: The Poet X , which won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature in 2018, With the Fire on High a year later, and 2020's Clap When You Land , which has been tapped by the production company Made Up Stories for a television adaptation with Acevedo as a screenwriter. Her latest novel Family Lore , Acevedo's first for adults, explores the dynamics between women in a Dominican American family. Acevedo says all her books \"stretch the ability of language\" to illustrate the intricacies of family, justice, and womanhood within Latinidad. \"If a book was a gala, I'm honoring and giving flowers to hood morenitas from all over the world,\" she says.\n\nMore than the acclaim she's received, Acevedo says she finds it most gratifying when readers tell her they've shared her books with their family members and had intergenerational conversations after reading them. \"You don't receive a prize for that,\" she says, \"but it is the most moving testament to what I hope my work can do.\" -Mariah Espada\n\nAt the heart of Willy Chavarria's designs is a radical celebration of authenticity. The 56-year-old fashion designer, who's also a senior vice president of menswear at Calvin Klein, founded his eponymous label in 2015, with a hunger for beauty in all forms and a refusal to water down his politics to appeal to the industry. \"That was the first thing I talked about with my team,\" Chavarria says. \"We are a brand that is political and stands up for justice and human dignity-that will always be a part of our ethos.\"\n\nChavarria began his career in fashion nearly three decades ago working in the stockroom of Joe Boxer as a college student, before moving into a design role at the company; later, he did stints at brands including Ralph Lauren and American Eagle. He attributes his convictions to his experiences moving through the world as a queer Chicano man and to growing up in a politically active, working-class Mexican family in a small town in California's Central Valley.\n\nHis commitment to delivering fashion with a message has taken many forms: sharply tailored suiting, voluminous silhouettes, and subversive workwear that challenge conventions around gender and sexuality; runway shows that bring issues like immigration to the forefront, like his spring/summer 2019 collection, which began with the spoken prompt, \"Have you ever seen a human in a cage?\"; and castings that show a more expansive view of beauty by centering models of color and selecting real people, from his friends to strangers on the street, to appear alongside professionals.\n\nChavarria's values as much as his innovative designs have made him stand out in the fashion world, but he hopes his success is indicative of a bigger shift for the industry. \"I think the fashion industry is very much ready for change,\" he says. \"I would love to see a more authentic connection with people, a more positive approach to inclusion, and a way to show that we can be elegant and gorgeous and still be kind and sensitive.\" -Cady Lang\n\nRobin Arzón never expected to become one of the most influential figures in the fitness world. A near-death experience in a hostage situation during college led her to take up running as she tried to cope with the trauma, but health and exercise were not initially her career focus. She worked for seven years as a corporate attorney in New York City but in 2012 left her job to coach people on how to bike, run, lift weights, and move their bodies. Today as the head instructor of Peloton , she's one of the most recognizable faces at the company. She's also written a memoir and hosted a MasterClass on mental strength.\n\nHer reach expanded even further in 2021 when Peloton decided to launch classes in Spanish, an initiative in which Arzón, daughter of a Cuban mother and Puerto Rican father, played a major role. \"Our communities need movement,\" she says, emphasizing the importance of Peloton's cycling rides that highlight Spanish-language musical artists.\n\nArzón, 42, is currently on maternity leave with her second child but keeping busy. In addition to running her membership club, Swagger Society, she is publishing another book this September, a journal with motivational quotes and goal-setting frameworks titled Welcome, Hustler . She recorded classes for Peloton throughout both her pregnancies and has made motherhood and passing on the traditions of her forebears a central part of her brand. Last year, she published a children's book called Strong Mama , and this summer, she launched a bilingual toyline, Bebé Fuerte, that encourages age-appropriate movement for children with phrases in both English and Spanish.\n\n\"I carry my mother's story as a Cuban refugee and my father's Boricua legacy with me,\" she says. \"As a mother, I plan to pass on the history, rich with tenacity.\" She adds: \"The energy of a thousand abuelas are with me.\" -Eliana Dockterman\n\nAs the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona oversees a department that provides guidance for roughly 65 million students nationwide, from pre-K to adult learners.\n\nEver since he joined the Cabinet in March 2021, he has been faced with a series of historic challenges, from how to safely return to in-person teaching after the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to advising colleges and universities on how to legally recruit diverse student bodies after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill last summer. This October, millions of federal student loan borrowers must resume payments for the first time in three years, and Cardona is focused on getting them enrolled in an income-driven repayment program that could cut what they owe on undergraduate loans in half.\n\nThe grandson of a sugarcane farmer from Puerto Rico, Cardona, 48, grew up in a bilingual household in Meriden, Conn., and he says he has a special affinity for students who may have been underestimated because their English wasn't as strong as their native tongue. He's especially focused on closing racial achievement gaps and making sure schools have the resources to support multilingual students so that they can compete in the global economy.\n\n\"There are so many students with the same potential that I had that oftentimes may be overlooked in our schools,\" Cardona says. \"I know that across America we have students with tremendous potential, as long as people believe in them. People believed in me in my community, so I want to make sure that the same is true in all communities in our country.\" -Olivia B. Waxman\n\nGloria Calderón Kellett's creative ambitions have always gone far beyond mere representation. The 48-year-old showrunner, producer, writer, director, and actor has devoted her career to expanding not just the number but also the variety of stories Hollywood tells about the Latino community. \"We are still in a pretty dire state of erasure,\" Calderón Kellett says. \"So, for me, the fix to that is: put us everywhere. Because we are everywhere.\"\n\nAfter getting her start as a screenwriter on shows like How I Met Your Mother and Devious Maids , Calderón Kellett, the daughter of Cuban immigrants, co-created an acclaimed reboot of Norman Lear's 1970s sitcom One Day at a Time , this time centering on a multigenerational Cuban American family. Since that series wrapped in 2020 after four critically acclaimed seasons, Calderón Kellett has become remarkably prolific. Along with creating With Love , a rom-com series that spotlights lovers of all ages and sexualities, and executive producing gory gentrification satire The Horror of Dolores Roach , Calderón Kellett has multiple feature film projects in development and a play slated to debut at Pasadena Playhouse in early 2024. In January, she was appointed to the Television Academy's Executive Committee.\n\nYet Calderón Kellett isn't letting success make her complacent. If anything, she's become more vocal than ever about the political power of storytelling. A member of both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, she sounded off on a picket line in August about the crucial need for solidarity among Latino artists: \"Policymaking starts by what people see in Hollywood.\"\n\nAnd she isn't just speaking out-she's doing real work to make change in the entertainment industry. Calderón Kellett also chairs the arts nonprofit Creative Coalition's Diversity Gap Initiative, which subsidizes the living expenses of new hires in the entertainment industry who come from low-income backgrounds. \"The advocacy goes hand in hand with the work that I do,\" she explains. \"The reason I'm a storyteller is because I didn't see myself [in pop culture]. And so I want other people to not feel that they're invisible.\" -Judy Berman\n\nJulio Rodríguez's numbers are reason enough to declare him the future of baseball. In September, the Seattle Mariners center fielder, who grew up in the Dominican Republic, became just the fourth player age 22 or younger to join the 30-30 club-30 or more home runs and stolen bases in the same season. During his relentless August, \"J-Rod\" broke the MLB record for most hits in a four-game span, with 17. In his 2022 rookie campaign, Rodríguez became the first player in major league history with 15 or more home runs, 50 or more RBIs, and 20 or more stolen bases in his first 90 career games. According to one advanced datapoint on power and production, Rodríguez joined Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, and Ted Williams as the best rookie position players ever. It's no wonder that, in August 2022, Seattle gave Rodríguez a massive contract extension, worth at least $210 million over a dozen years.\n\nWhat may be more important than J-Rod's stats, however, is his personality. Baseball needs marketable stars. Rodríguez shines with a smile on his face and engages with fans at the stadium and through social media. \"It's really important for me to show that you've got to have fun in this game,\" says Rodríguez, 22. \"If you take it too seriously, you're not really sending a good message to people. I'm always spreading positivity.\"\n\nRodríguez helped the Mariners end a 21-year playoff drought in 2022; Seattle is fighting for postseason position down the home stretch this year. The Mariners, who entered the majors as an expansion team in 1977, are the only existing baseball franchise to never reach a World Series. Long-suffering Mariners fans, Rodríguez says, \"should know that we're always going to put in the work. We're always going to be fighting for them. Because that's what they deserve.\"\n\nWith J-Rod roaming center field, the payoff should be sweet. -Sean Gregory\n\nErik Ramirez discovered his passion for cooking as a teenager during a summer with his uncle in Grand Isle, La., a remote town on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico. By day, Ramirez would work at a local supermarket, while evenings were spent in the kitchen, where the two would try to prepare food from a range of backgrounds and styles.\n\n\"He wasn't a chef, but he really enjoyed cooking,\" Ramirez says of his uncle. \"He made it fun.\"\n\nRamirez, now 42, went on to get a culinary education at the Art Institute of Philadelphia, then worked his way up through the kitchens of some of the top-rated restaurants in the world, before opening his own in Brooklyn. He was among the chefs to serve the stars at the 2021 Met Gala and was a finalist for the James Beard Outstanding Chef Award in 2023. Today, he has two restaurants in New York City (and another on the way), one in Madrid, and one in London.\n\nBorn in New Jersey to Peruvian parents with Japanese and Italian ancestry, Ramirez has tailored his menus around his own cosmopolitan cultural heritage. His flagship restaurant, Llama Inn, serves Peruvian-inspired fare infused with flavors, ingredients, and techniques from across the globe, such as lomo saltado , a traditional Peruvian dish, served with Chinese crepes and chiles on the side.\n\nThat the concept would attract critical acclaim was hardly a given, says Ramirez, who had grown used to seeing such praise reserved for chefs at European or New American restaurants. \"I had never looked at Peruvian cuisine as something that I wanted to cook, because I always had this idea of it being homey, traditional.\" Now, however, he's determined to help it be taken more seriously in the culinary world-\"to show,\" he says, \"that it belongs among the best of the best.\" -Solcyre Burga\n\nDolores Huerta is a civil rights icon who has spent her life championing better working conditions for laborers.\n\n\"The working people, these are the fabric of the country,\" Huerta, 93, says. \"And if they cannot afford to feed their families, then that reflects on the whole economy.\"\n\nHuerta, who is Mexican American, was born in the mining town of Dawson, N.M. Her activism career began in 1955 when she founded a chapter of the Community Service Organization, which led voter-registration drives. She then co-founded the United Farm Workers Association (UFW), alongside her longtime collaborator Cesar Chavez.\n\nIn 1965, Huerta stood beside striking grape-farm workers as growers tried to run them over with cars and pointed rifles at them. She was the lead negotiator in the contract they secured that included provisions eliminating harmful pesticides, allowing for rest periods, and securing access to drinking water and toilets in the field.\n\nWhile at UFW, Dolores helped usher in an immigration law that legalized most undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 1982. \"That act helped thousands of people get their immigration status in the United States of America,\" she says.\n\nHer famous slogan, \" Si, se puede \"-Spanish for \"Yes, we can\"-has lived on beyond its original intent, which was to quell concerns that workers in Arizona could not strike because a state law could send them to prison. It's now a rallying cry for progressive change-one commandeered by Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. When she met President Obama for the first time after he was elected , he thanked her for letting him steal her slogan. That was \"pretty awesome,\" she says.\n\nHuerta received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Now, through the Dolores Huerta Foundation, she is focused on increasing access to voting and training young political organizers. \"When we look at all of the movements that have changed things in our country,\" she says, \"it's always been young people.\" -Sanya Mansoor\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

I think the quality of our work will continue to open doors. All I can say is that we may need to have more people behind the camera, writers especially, but it's happening. You have to be patient,\" Hayek Pinault told TIME.\n\nLatinos-who make up nearly a fifth of the U.S. population and are the country's second largest racial and ethnic group- only make up about 7% of lead roles, and less than 6% of writers in major films. And even when Latinos are represented, research shows that their roles are not necessarily positive, as more than a third of Hispanic or Latino actors were depicted as criminals, according to a count by USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative that looked at the top-grossing movies from 2007 to 2019.\n\nHayek Pinault, who is also regarded by many as a sex symbol, also touched on the oversexualization of Latinas in the film industry.\n\n\"I think that Latinas are given the stereotype about being sexy because we are,\" she says while laughing. \"But it's good that they're saying we are a lot more than that.\"\n\nThe TIME100 special airs Sunday at 7/6c on ABC and streams on Hulu and Disney+.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com ."

      "text": "Why the Latino Vote in Arizona Could Be Decisive in 2012\n\nFollow @TIMEPolitics\n\nConsider it an awkward coincidence: The final Republican debate before the Super Tuesday primary took place in Arizona, at the epicenter of the national immigration debate. When the remaining four candidates took the stage on Wednesday night, they were asked about the state's tough crackdown on illegal immigration, which has defined the local Republican Party in recent years, buoyed the hopes of local Democrats and been condemned by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice. The candidates needed to answer carefully.\n\nThough the GOP base in Arizona is still roiled by the influx of undocumented immigrants into the state, the Obama campaign is betting that a backlash led by the growing Latino community can turn Arizona into a new presidential battleground in 2012. This is the subject of my cover story in the new issue of TIME , available online to subscribers Thursday and on newsstands Friday. For the cover, photographer Marco Grob traveled to Arizona to shoot an amazing gallery of portraits of Latino voters .\n\nMORE : Read TIME's Exclusive Interview with Marco Rubio\n\nPhotographs by Marco Grob for TIME\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Obama campaign will open its fourth field office in Arizona, a state no Democrat has won since Bill Clinton and which native-son John McCain won in 2008 by nine points. The location of the office, a storefront on Phoenix's majority-Latino west side, matters. Just a few months ago, it was used by campaign volunteers for Daniel Valenzuela, a local firefighter, who mounted an underdog bid for the City Council on the theory that he could turn out Latino voters who don't normally vote. He won big in 2011, as did the new Democratic mayor in Phoenix, Greg Stanton.\n\nA group of young people calling themselves \"Team Awesome\" knocked on 72,000 doors in the city to support Valenzuela's bid. They increased off-year turnout among the Latino community by 480%, more than delivering Valenzuela's margin of victory. \"There is a ripple effect that has the city and the county and the state of Arizona looking at the way they approach politics,\" says Joseph Larios, 29, a community organizer now working with the state Democratic Party who helped Valenzuela develop his strategy. \"It's impossible to say going after low-propensity Latino voters doesn't matter based on what happened.\"\n\nFor the Obama campaign nationwide, \"expanding the electorate\" increasingly means \"expanding the Latino electorate.\" If Obama is able to win heavily-Latino Western states like Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, he could still win in the electoral college even if he loses historically key states in the industrial Midwest like Ohio and Wisconsin. \"If we do our grassroots stuff right on the ground in all these Western states, which we will, because it's something we are good at,\" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina told me, \"we could seriously change the outcome.\"\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have generally done a dismal job through the primary of appealing to Latino voters. George W. Bush won more than 40% of the community in 2004, but in a recent Latino Decisions poll conducted for Univision, 72% of Latinos said the GOP either did not care about their support or was hostile to their community. The 27% who sensed hostility represented a seven point increase from April of 2011, when the same pollsters asked the question. \"Conservatives have not realized how their tone and rhetoric has turned people off,\" says Jennifer Korn, who led George W. Bush's Latino outreach effort in 2004.\n\nPHOTOS : Being Latino in Arizona\n\nThere are many within the Republican party urging a moderation in tone. Marco Rubio, the newly elected Cuban-American senator from Florida, and a potential vice presidential pick, is trying to make that shift happen. \"I'm always trying to remind my colleagues that if they lived in Mexico or anywhere in Latin America, and their kids were hungry, every night went to sleep hungry, and your country provided no opportunity for you to feed them, you're telling me that there's nothing you wouldn't do to feed them?\" he says. \"You're telling me you wouldn't go anywhere there was a job so you could send money to them?\"\n\nSo in the days remaining before the Arizona primary, pay close attention to how the GOP Presidential candidates talk about immigration. They have little to gain from Republicans by pivoting to softer rhetoric, but they have much to gain in the general election."

Students protested in Manhattan against Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's opposition to the Dream Act, a proposal that would create a path for undocumented children to legalize their immigration status.\n\nFollow @TIMEPolitics\n\nThe Latino vote will matter in the 2012 election. So say Republicans and Democrats , and even the cover of TIME magazine . But just how much it will matter is not clear at this point. Too many factors remain fluid. We don't know how close races in key states will be, what the Latino and non-Latino turnout will be, or how the vote will split between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.\n\nBut we can make some pretty good back-of-the-envelope guestimations, which is exactly what the political consultants inside the Obama and Romney camps have been doing.\n\nOn Monday, I participated in an Aspen Institute panel about the Latino vote in 2012, which was broadcast on C-Span , and I tried to boil down the impact of Latinos to a few simple numbers.\n\n( PHOTOS: Election 2012: Faces of the Latino Vote )\n\nIn national elections since the early 1990s, Republicans have had a floor of about 20% among Latinos, a group that includes a large population of Cuban Americans in Florida. Democrats have always won at least 55%. So about 25% of the Latino vote is at play in the middle. (In one survey, Romney now polls at 14% among Latinos, though that poll, for the moment, is an outlier.)\n\nSo when we consider the impact of Latinos in 2012, we are looking at a swing between about a 20% vote share for Republicans and a 45% vote share. The question that follows is how much of an impact this swing will have on the final electoral college results. The polls that really matter are state-by-state surveys, not national ones.\n\nLatinos are expected to make up about one in ten voters this year, but many of those votes, in big states like Texas, California and New York, will have no impact on the electoral college, since those states are not in play for Romney. But Latinos can have a big impact on the outcomes in Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and Florida, and a marginal impact in states like North Carolina and Ohio, all of which both parties will contest.\n\nThe polling firm Latino Decisions , which is the gold standard of Latino-American polling, recently put out a report on the impact of Latinos in these states. They found that for every eight points that Republicans lose among Latinos in states like Colorado and Nevada, the party needs to pick up another single point among non-Latino voters in order to not lose ground statewide.\n\n( PHOTOS: Being Latino in Arizona )\n\nFor example, if Obama gets 69% of the Latino vote in Nevada (ceding to Romney just 31%), then Obama can still win the state by capturing only 47% of the non-Latino vote (ceding to Romney 53%). If Obama gets a little more than 63% of the Latino vote, then he needs to get 48% of the non-Latino vote. Here is the chart:\n\nThere are many caveats to this formula, but it provides a helpful outline of the landscape. The difference between Democrats winning 80% of Latinos and winning 45% of Latinos in a state like Nevada corresponds to about three points in the non-Latino vote. In other words, we are talking about a field goal, not a touchdown. But in states like Nevada and Colorado, which have a history of hosting close presidential contests, that may be enough.\n\n( MORE: Why Latino Voters Will Swing the 2012 Election)\n\nThese numbers also help explain the different approaches that the Romney and Obama campaigns have taken to the election. With its vast network of staffers and year-long grace period to prepare, the Obama campaign is pursuing a strategy that focuses on deploying specialized teams, which are reaching out to  constituent groups, building an enormous ground game and making a huge investment in technology, from iPhone apps (which don't always work) to new data gathering programs. For the most part, these factors will only impact the outcome if the final score is close enough to be decided by a field goal. Romney, who has fewer resources after a bruising primary, is building a campaign in the expectation that the 2012 will be yet another anti-incumbent wave cycle that will hinge upon the economy. In other words, it will be won with touchdowns, not field goals.\n\nAs the Romney campaign rejiggers for the general election, there will be a pivot, at least in tone, to appeal to Latino voters. The tough talk-advocating \"self-deportation\" and calling Arizona a \"model\" for the nation-will almost surely give way to more positive talk about the need for fair reforms to immigration law. And Romney is not going to completely cede the ground game or the technological arms race to Obama. But the underlying difference outlook is almost sure to remain up until Election Day. One team will be counting on its kicker, the other is betting it won't need one.\n\nPHOTOS: Political Pictures of the Week, March 31-April 6"

      "text": "What Trump Can't Promise Latino Voters\n\nRamos is an author, Emmy-Award winning journalist and contributor for Telemundo News and MSNBC. Prior to her career in journalism, Ramos was the Deputy Director of Hispanic Media for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, a political appointee during the Obama Administration, and served in President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. She is the author of Finding Latin-X: In Search of the Voices Redefining Latino Identity and Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America\n\nI n less than two weeks, we will find out whether the inroads Donald Trump made with Latino voters in 2020 were an anomaly-or a sign of a deeper realignment. Yet the votes Latinos cast this November will tell us more about the way Latinos view themselves in America rather than the way they see Trump.\n\nAs Trump has focused the nation's eyes on remaining fearfully fixated on migrants, a growing number of Latinos have joined the \"send them back\" chants, perfectly blending into the conservative masses purporting to display patriotism. Among the MAGA crowds, behind their American flags, or inside their homes, many Latinos seem to be finding a sense of belonging in Trumpism's othering. At the end of the day, nothing is more patriotic than sharing a common enemy.\n\nBut what happens when the police flood lights burst on and the ICE sirens blare under a second Trump Administration? What happens when Trump's wall comes up even higher and the nation's eyes turn on their neighbors? Who becomes \"the other\" now?\n\nAccording to a recent New York Times / Siena College poll , a majority of Latinos, including those who are foreign-born, are not insulted by Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. In fact, a majority of Latinos don't believe Trump is talking about them when he criminalizes migrants.\n\nIn fact, it is understandable that a segment of Latinos feels more detached from their homelands and their immigrant roots. Today's Latino population is more Americanized and assimilated than ever before. Third-generation Latinos are now the fastest growing segment of Latinos in the country, which means the majority of the Latino electorate is now U.S.-born and predominately English-speaking. Many no longer see themselves reflected in the immigrant story-a story that provided a collective sense of allegiance and solidarity for generations of Latinos that once felt foreign in American lands. Many, simply, just see themselves as Americans.\n\nThe question is: how does Trump see them? \"You guys are the same as me,\" Donald Trump recently told a group of Latino and Afro-Latino barbershop patrons during a campaign stop in the Bronx. \"It's the same stuff. We were born the same way...\" Trump continued, facing a group of brown men that were looking at him with the utmost admiration.\n\nTherein lies the power of Trumpism: In its transactional ability to convince a group of minorities that they are part of the the fight against the \"other.\" While this is a powerful political strategy, let's not forget that Trump's own record shows that he has never believed that Black and Latinos are, well, the \"same\" as him.\n\nIn the 1970's the Department of Justice sued Trump's real estate company for discriminating against renters of color. While the lawsuit ended in a settlement, testimony shows that rental applications filled by Black people were marked with the letter \"C\" for \"colored.\" By 2011, Trump was already fueling birtherism, falsely implying President Obama wasn't born in the U.S. A few years later, Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign by criminalizing Mexican immigrants. That same year, he implied that Gonzalo Curiel, the U.S-born judge overseeing the fraud case against Trump University in San Diego, couldn't be impartial because he was \"Hispanic\" and \"Mexican.\" According to a recent report from The Atlantic , during his presidency, Trump allegedly said \"It doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f***ing Mexican!,\" while referring to fallen Army soldier Vanessa Guillen.\n\nNow, threatened by the image of a Black woman in power, Trump spends his days calling Vice President Harris \"lazy,\" \"stupid,\" and \"crazy,\" while his immigration advisor, Stephen Miller, looks at America's evolving diversity with the same innate horror he expressed as a 16-year old student in California-then, already calling for Latinos to assimilate.\n\nSo, what degree of assimilation can prove our \"Americanness\" to Trumpism? According to Dr. Celia Lacayo, from UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center, the white gaze will never fully accept Latinos as their equal. Dr. Lacayo calls this the \"perpetual inferiority\" theory, which underscores a tendency among white people to see Latinos as a non-white racial group that passes down their \"deficient\" culture through generations, essentially making us unable to progress, adapt and change. In other words, it is the belief that Latinos will never fully assimilate into American culture.\n\nUndeniably, the perpetual inferiority theory is hard to quantify; but when Trump is in his element, when he's in his comfort zone-when his tone shifts from courting to affirming-the words speak for themselves. There's a reason why, amid a nearly all-white campaign audience in Minnesota in 2020, Trump looked at his crowd and vocalized the words he couldn't get himself to utter in the Bronx: \"You have good genes.\" The white crowd erupted. They knew they weren't just the same. They knew they were superior.\n\nIn the final days of this election season, some Latinos will continue to fervently join the chorus of \"send them back,\" driven by the delusion that they would be safe in Trump's America. But how would Trump determine who is undocumented?  If Trump wins, these Latinos will quickly find out that his promise to enact the biggest deportation program in American history will inevitably unleash mass-scale racial profiling, putting a target on their back.\n\nIn that version of America, Trump isn't \"the same\" as us-last names, slight accents, skin color, or ancestry serve as distinguishing indicators. In that version of America, it's not up to us to decide how close we are to our immigrant roots-it's up to them . In that version of America, most of us end up walking freely through security check-points as we hold our U.S. passports, while we witness others being placed inside ICE trucks. The only thing separating us is thin air, and luck.\n\nOnly then will we understand that we, too, were always \"them.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Oregon Legislature reflects growing Latino influence, but will it last?\n\nTwo freshmen Latino legislators posted an unprecedented series of wins this year, including $46 million to extend the Oregon Health Plan to 17,600 undocumented children and prenatal and postpartum care to 48,000 undocumented women.\n\nRep. Teresa Alonso León, D-Woodburn, also succeeded with a measure requiring cultural competency for university and community college staffs. And Rep. Diego Hernandez, D-East Portland, guided through first-in-the-nation legislation requiring ethnic studies in public schools.\n\nThat has many in Oregon politics wondering if 2017 marks a watershed moment for Latino influence in the state.\n\nLatino legislators and activists have had occasional successes before, but never so consistently. \"This was, by far, our best session,\" said Ramon Ramirez, who has lobbied for Latino political and economic power for four decades.\n\nYet despite Oregon's Latino population growing 72 percent since 2000, to about 500,000, their representation in government lags far behind.\n\nLatino lawmakers make up 4.5 percent of the Legislature, less than half needed to be proportional to the population.\n\nResearch in 2015 found only eight of 420 elected county and non-legislative state positions in Oregon were filled by Latinos, according to the nonprofit Women Donors Network.\n\nStill, Alonso León said the 2016 campaign brought in one of the most diverse legislative bodies she's seen.\n\nShe and Hernandez were joined by other new lawmakers of color: Rep. Mark Meek, D-Gladstone, Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Happy Valley, Rep. Tawna Sanchez, D-Portland, and Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Lake Oswego, who recently replaced Rep. Ann Lininger.\n\n\"So we're all brand new legislators of color and that's exciting because it's going to help bring a different perspective,\" Alonso León said.\n\nCover All Kids passed with bipartisan support. Alonso León sponsored the bill, but she said she was in no way the bill's champion.\n\nThe Oregon Latino Health Coalition started its push to provide health care to undocumented children more than a decade ago.\n\nIn 2015, the House passed the measure on a 36-22 vote. The Senate Health Care committee advanced the bill with a \"do pass\" recommendation, but in the final budget reckoning, the effort slipped away with other dead bills.\n\n\"We used that experience to lay the groundwork (for 2017),\" said Linda Roman, a lobbyist for the Oregon Latino Health Coalition. Roman said they learned that not only did they need bipartisan support, they also needed support from both the House and Senate.\n\nAlberto Moreno, the coalition's executive director, said the effort grew in political and financial support over the years, but it was the diverse freshman legislative body this year that got it passed.\n\n\"Honestly, Cover All Kids should have been passed a long time ago,\" Alonso León said.\n\nThe bill's passage culminated years of work, including hundreds of Latino activists with the Latino Health Coalition working phone banks, urging constituents to call their legislators, countless conversations with legislators and massaging the bill to what it is today. It takes effect Jan. 1, 2018, providing health care to all Oregon children, regardless of residency status.\n\nMoreno said the bill's passage represents a cultural shift in the state.\n\n\"There used to be a time as early as 2005 that when you walked the halls of the Capitol, you didn't see any people of color, but that is steadily changing,\" Moreno said.\n\nHe said the Legislature's growing Latino influence allows lawmakers to see issues through the lens of people of color, and as immigrants who have faced historical and institutional barriers.\n\n\"Sure, our demographics are changing, sure we're increasing numbers, but that shouldn't be the measure of how we're trying to succeed in terms of representation,\" Hernandez said. \"Equity for me means that we start to undo the things that we've done in the past, that have subverted and subjugated ... communities of color and native communities.\"\n\nHe cosponsored for House Bill 2845, which will implement ethnic studies curriculum in public schools from kindergarten through grade 12. The Oregon Department of Education has until 2020 to make it happen.\n\nHernandez said this year's bills gained support from Latinos who felt targeted after President Trump's deportation order and subsequent targeted operations in Oregon, and by the spike of hate incidents in the state following Trump's election.\n\n\"For officials who represent many of these communities, that definitely created the urgency to do something,\" Hernandez said.\n\nLatino representation in the Oregon Legislature has grown incrementally for several decades, slowed by periods of no representation.\n\n\"Little by little, it took this long to build the base,\" said Ramirez, executive director of the Woodburn-based farmworker union Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. \"We're seeing the results of work that went into it for 17 years.\"\n\nThe earliest example is Raul Soto-Seelig, a Portland attorney and Cuban-native who was appointed to serve an unfinished Senate term in 1977. He was not re-elected.\n\nIn 1986, Rocky Barilla became the first Latino elected to the House. While Barilla said he doesn't credit himself with passage of Oregon's sanctuary law in 1987, he was the primary sponsor of the bill prohibiting local and state police from enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nHe calls himself an accidental politician - a legislator who only stumbled into politics after serving as a lawyer for a man interrogated by Polk County Sheriff's deputies who assumed he was undocumented.\n\nDelmiro Trevino was physically detained in the middle of the Hi-Ho Restuarant in Independence in January 1977. He was released after deputies established he was a longtime resident and U.S. citizen.\n\n\"I was the most apolitical person in the whole world,\" Barilla said. \"I never intended to be a legislator.\"\n\nBut after months of knocking on hundreds of doors a day in South and West Salem, which at the time was Assembly District 31, Barilla won the seat.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon and Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, or Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers United, asked Barilla to introduce a bill restricting local and state police from using resources to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nBarilla said he worked with other community leaders of color, which he jokingly referred to as \"just 10 of us back then.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to represent everybody in Oregon, Republican or Democrat, but make sure that people of color were represented because they weren't at the time,\" Barilla said.\n\nThe bill passed the Oregon Senate 29 to 1 and the House 58 to 1. It was signed into law July 7, 1987. Barilla was 38 years old.\n\nToday, three Republican legislators are spearheading an initiative petition that would repeal the law .\n\nFor years, Latino representation in Oregon was confined to the rare school board member or county commissioner.\n\nThe breakout exception was Susan Castillo, who served in the Senate in the 1990s and in the 2000s as superintendent of public instruction, which used to be a statewide elected position.\n\nAs a freshman legislator, Jessica Vega Pederson cosponsored a bill in 2013 that would have provided drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants living and working in Oregon.\n\nShe was the first Latina to serve in the Oregon House and served from 2013 to 2016.She served along with Joe Gallegos, another Democratic House member, who didn't  seek re-election in 2016.\n\n\"We had allies in the house who were strong supporters of the driver's bill, but having somebody else who was Latino in the House was really important to me,\" Vega Pederson said.\n\nBut they weren't successful with the driver's license bill. It was defeated by a well-funded effort when Measure 88 was placed on the 2014 ballot.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a harder campaign to fight, but we didn't have the broader understanding that there was going to be a concerted effort to move it to the ballot,\" Vega Pederson said. \"The Latino community took a hard hit with that defeat.\"\n\nShe said Castillo, who was the first Latina to serve in the Senate, helped pave the way for Latino legislators.\n\n\"There were a lot of champions before us, and we are finally seeing that work reflected in this year's session,\" said Vega Pederson, now a Multnomah County commissioner.\n\nIssues affecting communities of color are no different than in other communities, Alonso León said.\n\nEducation, job security, housing and economic stability matter to everyone. She said the value of a diverse Legislature comes when lawmakers are able to tap into their own experiences to help frame law to better serve diverse groups.\n\nFor Alonso León, who was born along Lake Patzcuaro, a region home to the indigenous Purepecha people of Michoacán, Mexico, her upbringing means she can better represent the Latino community.\n\nShe came to the United States when she was five years old. Her parents were farmworkers supporting a family of seven. During hot summers, she would help her parents pick berries. At 12, she interpreted housing information for her parents while speaking with a realtor when her family bought their first home.\n\n\"I don't think my parents anticipated one of their children would become a legislator,\" Alonso León said with a laugh. \"But they certainly created that opportunity by coming to the United States for a better life.\"\n\nWhen Alonso León kicked off her campaign, she knocked on roughly 4,000 doors in Woodburn with fliers translated in English, Spanish and Russian. She said she met people who said they had never voted because candidates never looked like them, spoke their language or shared their experiences.\n\nShe first learned of her potential influence on the community when she spoke with an 18-year-old high school student in English about her campaign and switched to Spanish when her father introduced himself in Spanish.\n\n\"He said 'I just want to say that, for the first time ever, I get to express myself in my native language,'\" Alonso León said. \"That was such a powerful moment for me because even if you speak another language, you can show your emotion and articulate things that are important to you. I wanted to cry right there in the doorway.\"\n\nAcción Política PCUNista, a Latino activist organization based in Woodburn, backed Alonso León's campaign and helped support the first elected Latino majority school board in the state, where 80 percent of Woodburn School District students are Latino.\n\nGroup volunteers knocked on 15,000 doors, registered 400 Latino voters and assisted about 200 others with their ballots in service of the election, according to Acción Política PCUNista.\n\nLatino candidates are a \"demographic inevitability,\" said Ron Mize, associate professor of language, culture and society at Oregon State University.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of Oregon Latinos are eligible to vote, according to the Pew Research Center. Mize said that number will climb over the next decade as Oregon Latinos reach 18 years old.\n\nMillennials represent 41.5 percent of the eligible Latino voter population nationwide, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nMize wrote a report assessing the social, political and economic role of Latinos in Oregon for the statewide Oregon Latino Agenda for Action.\n\n\"What has made this cycle particularly compelling, and why the story looks a little bit different right now, is that both Teresa and Diego were really experienced before they got to the statewide office,\" Mize said. \"They knew what they were doing, and they had a good cadre of supporters.\"\n\nThat, Mize said, is an early sign of growing Latino influence.\n\n\"I really do feel like this is the beginning,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Moreno, who also serves on the Oregon Commission on Hispanic Affairs, said Oregon's growing Latino population doesn't necessarily equate to growing representation.\n\n\"Latino population has doubled in the last decade, but what has not doubled is our representation,\" Moreno said. \"What has not doubled is our access to equitable resources, or economic opportunities, or civic opportunities.\"\n\nHernandez, who also serves on the Reynolds School District school board in Fairview, said minority influence can catch up to population growth with the help of equitable education .\n\nHe points to low graduation rates and high drop out rates for students of color that are representative of historical inequities in the education system.\n\n\"That's also symbolic of the poverty their parents have to face, so yes, we had a successful session in terms of social wins, but undoing generational poverty is going to require more action from the Legislature,\" Hernandez said.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Hernandez grew up in Portland where he found himself the only student of color, attending six elementary schools and three middle schools before completing high school, college and graduate school. His mother was a single parent with four children. She cleaned houses to support the family, sometimes enlisting 11-year-old Hernandez to help.\n\n\"I saw the experiences my immigrant family went through, and that gave me a perspective that folks in power may not have,\" Hernandez said.\n\nWhen he was elected to the school board in 2013, he was only 26. He was the first Latino elected to the board in a district with a Latino majority. Today, he is joined by his colleague Ricardo Ruiz.\n\nHe said it is important to build from the growing representation in community organizations, school boards, city councils and the Legislature in order to advance the next generation of Latino leaders.\n\nHernandez also believes the 2017 session reflected a cultural shift in the state, but it isn't because there was an easy path to representation. He said Latinos have been forced to challenge power, and challenge what he refers to as Oregon's \"status quo,\" as it relates to minorities in leadership roles.\n\n\"It's challenging when you are in the minority and literally marginalized,\" Hernandez said. \"So when you challenge power ... I would say some individuals really want to target you for who you are rather than your political beliefs.\"\n\n300 gather, seek solutions to race disparity in Salem-Keizer schools\n\nPending Trump DACA decision worries Oregon immigrants"

Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat-turned independent, hasn't announced whether she'll seek reelection in November.\n\nSinema in 2018 became the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Arizona since Dennis DeConcini left that seat in 1995. She ran a tightly scripted campaign that appealed to independents and moderates, a key voting bloc that's making Arizona competitive.\n\nNaturally, political pundits believe that kind of campaign playbook is the only route to victory for Gallego, especially if Sinema does jump into the fray.\n\nWhat they don't know or care to acknowledge is the fact that Gallego, unlike Sinema or Lake, doesn't have the luxury to hide his heritage - to pretend he's somebody he's not.\n\nTo many, he'll always be a Latino first, the brown guy who went to Harvard and defended this country as a Marine.\n\nThat's enough. No need for him to spell out his heritage, the argument goes, because the mere mentioning of it is a turnoff among some key voters.\n\nSadly, some voters might indeed be turned off by anyone pointing to Arizona's population statistics because they'll never vote for a Latino. Period.\n\nGallego's audacity was to point out the fact that 33% of Arizonans are Latino and that no Arizona Hispanic has ever been elected to the U.S. Senate. He would be the first one, should he get elected.\n\nIn other words, those are facts that some voters don't want to hear?\n\nGallego is a serious contender who has so far outraised Lake in campaign contributions.\n\nRecent campaign reports show Gallego has raised $3.3 million this quarter - which is roughly what his campaign has averaged each quarter in the first three reporting periods, according to The Arizona Republic's Ronald J. Hansen.\n\nA whopping 99% of donations were from small donors, Gallego has pointed out.\n\nLake, meanwhile, took in $2.1 million in her first quarter in the race.\n\nCampaign contributions are often indicative of a candidate's competitiveness.\n\nIn Gallego's case, clearly a lot of donors are willing to back his bid, but evidently that wasn't enough to catch attention. It was his tweet effectively admitting being proud of his Latino heritage that did it.\n\nGallego is right to point out the obvious - not just to make Latinos proud and get their vote but because he wouldn't be able to fool anyone by hiding it. People would just wait for the chance to remind him and everyone else that he is Hispanic.\n\nI hadn't planned to write about an Arizona Hispanic running for U.S. Senate, as I have done with other races. But felt compelled to do since clearly to some that matters - a lot.\n\nLike Gallego, I'm proud of my Latino heritage - my Mexican heritage specifically. That doesn't mean I don't love America. I do, and deeply. I proudly pledged my alliance to this country that has given me plenty of opportunities.\n\nUltimately, though, people of color don't have a choice. We can't hide our skin color or have a say over where we were born. Often, it is not us wanting to talk about race. We're often reminded of it and simply reacting to it.\n\nIn Gallego's case, the critics might be right that stating the obvious - the fact that he's Latino - might hurt his election chances.\n\nBut that's not on Gallego.\n\nThat's on Arizona voters - conservative, moderate or liberal - who might, just might, seriously consider a Hispanic as long he doesn't say it aloud.\n\nElvia Díaz is editorial page editor for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

      "text": "Paola Ramos explores the effects of Trumpism on the Latino vote in her book 'Defectors'\n\nLatinos are not a monolith.\n\nWe've heard that time and again, particularly when it comes to decoding the \"Latino vote\" during an election year . And time and again, the 63 million Hispanics or Latinos living in the U.S. (36 million of which are eligible to vote) have proven that very sentiment right. In 2020, Donald Trump won a higher percentage of the Latino vote than he did in 2016, and according to a recent Pew Research Center report, that number continues to shift.\n\nSo despite Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and border policies, why are Latinos tempted to vote against their own community? Why do Latinos feel comfortable among the far-right? What roles do tribalism, trauma and traditionalism play in all of this, and why should we listen to this growing group of voters?\n\nThose are all questions Emmy-winning journalist Paola Ramos seeks to answer in \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America\" (Pantheon, pp. 256, out now).\n\nThe Telemudno News and MSNBC contributor's follow-up to \" Finding Latin-X: In Search of the Voices Redefining Latino Identity\" explores how race, identity and political trauma have ignited a far-right sentiment among Latinos and how this group is shaping American politics.\n\n\"I hope 'Defectors' ingrains a very simple lesson, which is that to be Latino means that we are very complicated human beings,\" she says. \"That we, too, as individuals have complicated histories - and beautiful histories - but it's complicated.\"\n\nTo write her book, the VICE News reporter sat down with Gabriel Garcia, a first-generation Cuban American and former member of the Proud Boys , among other Jan. 6 rioters . She also spoke with: a Dominican hair salon worker who has internalized anti-Blackness rhetoric that's an epidemic of its own within the Latino community and who voted for Trump; a Latino border vigilante from El Paso ; Latina members of Moms for Liberty , which is a conservative group pushing legislation such as Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill; evangelical pastors and culture war crusaders .\n\n\"I hope this book gives people the curiosity to understand us a little better, to understand our history and to understand why we act a certain way, and more than anything, for Latinos, if they're reading this, it'll help us understand us more and hopefully have difficult conversations that I think Republicans and mostly Democrats should be having.\"\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQuestion: To write \"Defectors,\" you interviewed some people with extreme views that can negatively impact the Latino community. What would you say to anyone thinking, \"Why should we listen to them or give them a platform?\"\n\nPaola Ramos: I receive a lot of pushback sometimes for having these conversations with insurrectionists, with Moms for Liberty, with folks carrying pretty violent anti-immigrant rhetoric, so that question comes up all the time. I think the only way to understand what could be driving this shift toward Trumpism requires us to sit down and have those conversations. At the end of the day, what's so interesting about the conversations is that it's really not about politics but rather it comes down to people's individual journey to find belonging in this country.\n\nA search for belonging - more often than not - is now sort of driving some people toward Trumpism. As a community, having these conversations is an exercise that everyone should be willing to do because what I have also found is that it reveals what I tried to focus on in this book - which is that regardless if you're a Democrat or a Republican or independent, regardless of what you look like, regardless if you think you're a progressive or not - absolutely every single one of us is carrying a lot of baggage from Latin America, racial baggage and the baggage of this colonized mindset and political trauma. All of us carry that weight.\n\nIt's really, really important to at least attempt to understand that and that is what some of these difficult conversations got me to do. What I have found to be more interesting is when you just sit and listen to people and the act of listening is extremely important right now. The hardest part of this book, and our jobs, is getting people to trust you to sit down with them. It takes a while to get certain people that I spoke to in the book to want to sit down with me, to trust me enough to at least do the job of analyzing the \"why\" so I think all of this entails a lot of trust and trust is deeply broken in this country right now.\n\nDid you ever feel unsafe going into any of the interviews?\n\nI never felt unsafe. I felt discomfort many times. Particularly, when you enter into more of these conservative spaces, many times I am facing people that fundamentally disavow who I am as a queer Latina and there's a certain discomfort when, as a reporter, you're sort of challenging these power structures and you're challenging people's beliefs and you're pushing back. And maybe it's just because unconsciously I'm sort of trained, you know, for so many years of my life, I grew up with these Latino taboos and I do very much feel the weight of people's discomfort with who I am.\n\nWhether it's interviewing Enrique Tarrio from The Proud Boys or Moms for Liberty or sitting in churches with pastors talking about why being gay is wrong and talking about Christian nationalism or whether I'm at the border with Mexican Americans who fundamentally believe immigrants are criminals - I feel that discomfort. It just comes down to this sort of visceral sense of disgust that has been ingrained in some communities to dehumanize people - whether it's immigrants, queer people, trans people, or women. Of course, I've felt it.\n\nYou structured \"Defectors\" in three parts: Tribalism, traditionalism and trauma. How did you zero in on these three T's?\n\nI looked at the entire picture and I was trying to make sense of why some Latinos are warming up to the idea of mass deportation. Why is anti-Blackness resonating so much with some? Then I looked at another subgroup of Latinos and looked at why is it the case that as we become less religious there's then suddenly the rise of Latino evangelicals ? Why am I seeing so many Latinos be so in tune with the anti-transgender crusade ?\n\nA way to analyze it is that there are three driving forces at the heart of this. There's tribalism that tries to really understand the racial baggage that we have and the internalized racism and why and where that comes from. There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from.\n\nThat's how I made sense of it. The coolest part of the book beyond the reporting and having these conversations, of course, was leaning on historians, psychologists and researchers who helped me make sense of it all.\n\nLooking back at your reporting for \"Defectors,\" is there something or someone you walked away from having a different opinion about?\n\nHonestly, all of them. There's a tendency to be so scared of those who are so different from you and I fundamentally understand that. Before an interview with someone like the Proud Boys or Anthony Aguero that I interviewed at the border, I always walked into every single one of these interviews with so many preconceived biases and my own stereotypes and I was always very conscious of that. In fact, every time I walked into an interview and with every single person that I talked to, I was always kind of on guard. Then what I found in almost every instance was that their personas online, their stories, or who I thought they were were not necessarily the reality of their voices once I got to talk to them.\n\nI was talking to actual people, that like I said, were just kind of on this quest to find belonging and that's how they ended up feeling welcomed among these groups. I was surprised at everyone's ability to sort of humanize each other because, at the end of the day, there was a source of pain behind all of it.\n\nThat source of pain you discuss in the book, too, was so interesting to see at play with the Dominican hair salon owner who rejects her Blackness when you ask her about her racial identity.\n\nIn those moments it's so easy to walk away from the interview and be like, this woman is a racist. But it's not that simple, right? In so many of these instances, it could just be like the Afro-Latina hair salon owner is a racist but no - when I ask her, what's your race? And she says Hispanic. That rejection of saying and seeing herself as a Black woman, if we really do our jobs, comes down to a brutal history of colonization that has allowed for and encouraged people in very brutal and violent ways to resort to their ties to the Spanish colonizers, right? Because that has always been more idolized and embraced than being a Black person in Latin America.\n\nThat's where that pain comes from, and that's what people need to understand. In this country, where it is all about racial binaries where you're either Black or white, or where Black people are so criminalized, and African Americans have been so criminalized, then it leads to some Afro-Latinas to opt for whiteness under the guise of being Hispanic. It's not necessarily because they're racist but it's because that internalized racism has been so ingrained that it leads us to where we are right now.\n\nAfter having covered former president Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton's presidential campaigns, and seeing what's happened after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for reelection, what do you think the Democratic Party should do differently to mobilize Latinos to vote?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is a little bit of courage. I say this because I see a vice president Harris who when it comes to the issue of immigration, in my opinion, is falling into Republican traps. The trap being that there's a sense that you have to go to the center right on immigration if you want to win over independent voters and some conservative voters and even some Democrats. And so my wish is for someone like her, and just for leaders around the country, particularly when you're thinking about the Latino vote, is to understand that the long-term game and politics are always better than the immediate short-term game.\n\nAnd the long-term game is to recognize that there are millions and millions of people living in this country who are undocumented and who have been promised time and again comprehensive immigration reform - those are the same people being dehumanized, attacked and criminalized. My hope is that that courage, which is the courage that led a lot of Latino voters to vote for Joe Biden in 2020, driven by the belief that politicians in general would finally do comprehensive immigration form. That took a lot of courage back then, and I think they need that again.\n\nYour father Jorge Ramos has served as a news anchor for Univision for so many years and gained the trust of many Latino viewers. What do you hope longtime viewers take away from the legacy he's leaving behind?\n\nIt's been incredible to see the love he got, not just because it's heartwarming, but because it really speaks to the type of journalism he did which was based on trust. And that's such a hard thing to achieve today. It's been incredible to see how millions of Latinos have trusted him for so long and then I think of the way that both something like Univision and the Latino audience has grown throughout the last 40 years that my dad has been at the head of the newscast.\n\nI've learned so much from my dad and I think he's learned a little bit from me. He's taught me very important lessons - the main lesson has always been, \"You have the privilege of being a reporter and a journalist and your goal is to always hold those in power accountable.\" That has always been ingrained me. He's taught me to always be empathic, if you need people to talk to you and build trust then you have to walk into every interview being empathetic and understanding. And then he's taught me to listen and so I carry that with me everywhere I go.\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)"

      "text": "Meet East Hill's Latin American bakery and market filled with fresh breads and pastries\n\nA new Latin American bakery called Panadería y Tienda Sabor Latino has made its debut in Pensacola's East Hill neighborhood.\n\nThe specialty bakery and mini market located at 1020 B N. Ninth Ave. brings breads and pastries baked fresh daily, market goods, fresh fruit juices and handcrafted coffees to the table.\n\nThe shop is owned and operated by Laura Bocanegra and her husband, Iván Jiménez. Since the couple speaks predominately Spanish, Vanessa Mayes, executive director of nonprofit Global Corner, translated for the News Journal in an interview with Bocanegra and Jiminez.\n\n\"They recognized the need for Pensacola to have an establishment like this that would (meet) the needs of the Latino community here in Pensacola,\" Mayes said when translating. \"They realized that there were a number of Latin American establishments, but they recognized that there weren't any (Latin American) bakeries in town.\"\n\n\"Basically, (Jiminez) knew that it was important for him to bring that into the community, because just for the simple issue of nostalgia and in bringing that connection to the community,\" Mayes said. \"Bakeries bring people together in the Hispanic community.\"\n\nTheir fresh baked breads and pastries are made fresh every day in Foley, Alabama and then brought to the store. Bocanegra's father, John Bocanegra, makes much of the bread himself and their cookies are derived from family recipes.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you're from, what country you're from. You're going to love these cookies,\" Mayes translated for Bocanegra.\n\nWhile the couple hails from Columbia, the store offers a wide variety of sweet goods that reflect Latin American flavors. The shop's name, Sabor Latino, literally means \"Latin taste.\"\n\n\"All the different pastries are very popular and eaten in Mexico and Central America, so we would say it's a sort of a mixture of adored Hispanic pastries,\" Mayes said. \"They're putting out all the different products that they know that the Latin community can embrace because it brings them back to their own country.\"\n\nAmong the most popular pastries is the concha, a traditional Mexican sweet bread roll that has a signature crunchy streusel-like topping.\n\nWhile the shop is now open daily, more products will be rolled out in time, such as more market goods, juices and coffees.\n\n\"The whole concept that she's wanting to accomplish is - obviously the main focus is the bakery - but she also is bringing more products in. She really wants to have a mini store where she can have different products that are coming in from around Latin America that the Hispanic community can enjoy so she's slowly getting in more and more products,\" Mayes said.\n\nNot only has Bocanegra seen the eyes light up from those in the Hispanic community, but also just from Pensacola as a whole that has embraced them.\n\n\"The Hispanic community has definitely come out in full force to support their efforts, but more importantly the Pensacola community,\" Mayes said. \"She has seen so much support on Facebook and social media platforms and not only that, but people actually are coming into the store which makes her very happy.\"\n\n\"She wants to reach out and say thank you so much for all the support that they've shown her not only to the Hispanic community but also all Pensacola.... So warm and so supportive, and they can't wait to continue serving the community. That's been the best part and the most emotional part of her opening this place up is the show of support,\" Mayes said.\n\nSabor Latino is open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. On Sundays, they are open from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nThey will be celebrating their grand opening May 4 and May 5, where they will be presenting all their baked goods, coffee for the guests and live Latin music.\n\nMore updates and information can be found on the Panadería y Tienda Sabor Latino Facebook page."

      "text": "'I'm afraid.' OKC Latino community speaks on election, immigration, their concerns\n\nWhen Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into state law in May a bill authorizing state and local law enforcement authorities to arrest people in Oklahoma who didn't have proper legal documentation, the action was widely viewed as a political stunt.\n\nThe law was modeled after a similar measure approved in Texas. Due to Stitt, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republican officials taking trips to the U.S.-Mexico border, sending busloads of immigrants to northern cities or being involved in other actions, they were seen to be trying to reinforce a presidential campaign issue - that only the re-election of former President Donald Trump would end \"border chaos\" caused by the Biden administration.\n\nBut passage of the law struck fear into the heart of Oklahoma City's Latino community.\n\nThis was clear at a gathering of Latino leaders and members of the community held by The Oklahoman, which provides an online and newspaper \"Viewpoints\" opinion platform to explore issues that impact its readers.\n\nEven though the new Oklahoma immigration law was blocked by a federal judge from taking effect in July, \"for the first time I felt the fear of my friends, my family, my classmates. I was afraid,\" said Lesly Fraire, an Oklahoma City Community College student who was a member of the forum panel.\n\nOther panelists included: state Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval; Erika Lucas, CEO of Stitchcrew and a founder of VEST Her Ventures; Salvador Ontiveros, CEO of the Latino Community Development Agency; Angelica Villalobos, executive director of Immigrant Connexion; and attorney Sam Wargin Grimaldo.\n\nIn signing the immigration enforcement bill, Stitt said his sole aim was \"to protect all 4 million Oklahomans, regardless of race, ethnicity or heritage.\"\n\nHe added, \"I love Oklahoma's Hispanic community\" and said members of that community should \"rest assured that this law does not give law enforcement the authority to profile individuals or question them about their immigration status without reasonable suspicion of a crime.\"\n\nHowever, the OKC community was not reassured, several forum participants said, particularly in view of the pledge by Trump to launch a massive deportation of Latino immigrants on \"Day One\" of his next term in office. And Alonzo-Sandoval said the community was \"damaged\" by the comment of a Trump supporter at a recent campaign rally that Puerto Rico was a \"floating island of garbage.\"\n\nAcknowledging that \"there are good people in both parties,\" Lucas, who said she is an independent, said, \"Until the Republican party owns and calls out those who make - and they're not just bad comments, they're racist - the only way we're going to keep those people accountable is by showing up. And, mi gente , it starts with us.\"\n\nLucas and other panel members noted the many barriers to greater political participation by Latinos in Oklahoma City.\n\n\"It's important that we encourage, empower and activate the Latino people here,\" said Ontiveros, \"but sometimes we get in our own way.\"\n\nIn conversations with community members, Ontiveros said, \"Sometimes they downplay or don't believe that voting or participation will make a difference. Changing this mindset is a big challenge.\" Some, he said, come from countries where governments have long histories of acting against the interests of the people and, therefore don't expect the situation in the United States to be any different. Others, he said, are simply working so hard and for such long hours that going to meetings and otherwise participating in political activity is impossible.\n\n\"A lot of times we are motivated by fear, and that's what gets us to show up,\" said Grimaldo, an attorney in the same law firm as state Sen. Michael Brooks, a longtime advocate for Latinos in OKC. \"But we need to be engaged all the time. Many issues are out there.\"\n\n\"We can't just be reactive,\" said Alonzo-Sandoval, who ran for the Legislature right out of college and became one of the state's youngest elected representatives. He noted that schools were not performing well for children in the Latino community, the economy wasn't working well for adults and families had difficulty accessing health care.\n\n\"I know we're tired. I know we're busy caring for our families and paying the bills and all that,\" Lucas said. \"But that's what I mean when I say that we must actively show up and vote for the right candidates and hold those candidates calling us names accountable. The power is in our votes. It's one party. And not everybody is racist, and not everybody is making those racist comments. But the mere fact that you're not calling that out, that you're not holding your party and your peers accountable, that makes you complicit.\"\n\n\"You would not allow your own children or your family members to be so disrespectful to another person,\" said Villalobos. \"Why would you allow the Republican Party to be so trashy against people. They're supposed to represent the interests of everyone.\"\n\nSeveral panelists noted that the power and influence of the Latino community in the city and the state were almost certain to grow.\n\n\"Our future is in educating the students,\" said Grimaldo. \"Our experience growing up is that we were our parents' interpreters. Our parents sacrificed so much so that they could get to a position where they could provide for us. In doing that, they weren't able to engage in politics and civic life, or it came as a second priority to them. As leaders now, it's incumbent on us to reach out to the younger generation ... and make sure that they're getting involved in an active way. We have so much power, especially when you look at the demographics.\""

      "text": "13 books to break down the immigration debate amid Trump's return to power\n\nThere's a growing list of dehumanizing rhetoric from President Donald Trump about immigrants in this country, but while the 47th president lost the overall percentage of Latino votes to former Vice President Kamala Harris, exit polls showed he made gains within the demographic, with 54% of Latino men and 38% of Latinas picking him in the 2024 election.\n\nSince Trump announced his first candidacy in 2015, he has called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and referred to immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \"people from shithole countries.\" During his second presidential run, a Trump-supporting comedian called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" sparking backlash from the public and criticism from prominent celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin. And before returning to the White House, Trump promised to target immigrants with criminal records and launch a \"mass deportation\" to remove millions from the U.S. The Trump administration has also sent 1,500 more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSo why are Latinos moving toward a seemingly antagonistic political movement? Journalist Paola Ramos, who recently released the book \"Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means for America ,\" says the answer is complicated.\n\n\"At the end of the day, what's so interesting ... is that it's really not about politics but rather it comes down to people's individual journey to find belonging in this country,\" Ramos says. \"A search for belonging - more often than not - is now sort of driving some people toward Trumpism.\"\n\nAs Latinos continue to be seen as a homogenous group of voters, authors like Ramos, political consultant Mike Madrid and journalist Maria Hinojosa are working to correct that misunderstanding. Other authors like Karla Cornejo Villavicencio and Héctor Tobar are telling stories that humanize and shed light on the journeys of undocumented immigrants and their positive impact in the U.S.\n\nHere are 13 books that can help us better understand the Latino community, how they shape American politics and why they are not a monolith.\n\nConsidered one of the country's authoritative experts on Latino voters, and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project , Mike Madrid's \"The Latino Century: How America's Largest Minority Is Transforming Democracy\" seeks to answer how and why Democrats and Republicans have failed to appeal to the Latino vote and the implications of that.\n\nUsing over three decades of research and campaign experience, Madrid argues Latinos make up the fastest segment of the most important swing states in the Electoral College, and \"fitting neither the stereotype of the aggrieved minority nor the traditional assimilating immigrant group, Latinos are challenging both political parties' notions of race, religious beliefs, economic success and the American dream.\"\n\nRamos' book explores how race, identity and political trauma have ignited a far-right sentiment among Latinos and how this group is shaping American politics.\n\nTo write her book, the Telemundo News and MSNBC contributor sat down with Gabriel Garcia, a first-generation Cuban American and former member of the Proud Boys , among other Jan. 6 rioters . She also spoke with a Latino border vigilante from El Paso , Latina members of Moms for Liberty , a conservative group pushing legislation such as Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, evangelical pastors and others.\n\nAuthor Laura E. Gómez , a UCLA School of Law professor, wrote a book to understand where Latinos fit in America's racial order - the how and why of Latinx identity becoming a distinctive racial identity.\n\n\"Latinos have long influenced everything from electoral politics to popular culture‚ yet many people instinctively regard them as recent immigrants rather than a longstanding racial group,\" reads Gómez's website .\n\nIn her debut book, the Ecuadorian American writer centers immigrant stories in a way that isn't inspirational or exploitative but simply real and raw. In New York, the author introduces us to undocumented workers who helped on Ground Zero after Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In Miami, Villavicencio highlights undocumented folks who frequent botánicas because they have no other healthcare options due to their status. In Connecticut, we learn about undocumented men in sanctuaries and the effects of family separation.\n\nThe Harvard graduate writes: \"The twisted inversion that many children of immigrants know is that, at some point your parents become your children, and your own personal American dream becomes making sure they age and die with dignity in a country that has never wanted them.\"\n\nAnthropologist Jason de Léon paints a more humanizing portrait of smugglers (or coyotes, as they're most commonly called) as they shepherd migrants from South American countries through Mexico in hopes of arriving in the U.S.\n\nFor the book, de Léon spent seven years following the migrants (those from Honduras specifically) and their coyotes in an attempt to understand why smugglers fall into this line of work, and their responsibility over the migrants they're tasked with guiding toward the possibility of the American dream.\n\nIn her book, Peruvian-born author and journalist Marie Arana argues that, as this election has shown, Latinos are not a monolith and they do not represent a single group.\n\nIn \"LatinoLand,\" Arana draws from her own experience as a daughter of a mixed-status family - her mother from Kansas and Boston, and her father a Peruvian-born civil engineer - to attempt to understand the fastest-growing minority group in America.\n\nNew Yorker staff writer Jonathan Blitzer covers about four decades of immigration policy and its political implications.\n\n\"My biggest hope is that someone might read through this book and attach actual people to all the narratives, slogans, and bromides they hear daily about the immigration issue more generally,\" Blitzer said in an interview last month . \"I am convinced that a tipping point exists where exposure to the true human drama can overtake callous preconceptions. In recent years, in the US and abroad, there seems to be this idea, masquerading as a kind of pragmatism, that the only way to deal with insoluble policy dilemmas is to harden our hearts against those who are suffering. Not only do I think that's a false choice; it also gets the policy backwards.\"\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Héctor Tobar writes a definitive and personal exploration of what it means to be Latino in the U.S.\n\nThe journalist and English and Chicano/Latino Studies professor tackles the impact that colonialism, public policy, immigration, media and pop culture have had on decoding the meaning of \"Latino\" as a racial and ethnic identity.\n\n\"Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions\" by Mexican novelist Valeria Luiselli is based on her experience as an interpreter for Central American child migrants seeking a new life in the U.S.\n\nThe book is structured around the forty questions she asks these undocumented children, whose ages range from 6 into their teens and are facing deportation.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa wrote \"Once I Was You: A Memoir of Love and Hate In A Torn America\" amid the 2020 presidential election. She said the anti-immigration rhetoric spewed by Trump and his supporters under his administration wasn't new - it was history repeating itself.\n\n\"Anti-immigration feeling was and has been a naturally occurring, cyclical phenomenon in this country. It's not a Republican or Democrat thing; it's an American thing (until we decide it's not),\" writes Hinojosa in her book.\n\nHistorian Paul Ortiz spans more than two hundred years in his book, looking at the intersectional history of the shared struggles for African American and Latinx civil rights.\n\n\"I wrote this book because as a scholar I want to ensure that no Latinx or Black children ever again have to be ashamed of who they are and of where they come from,\" Ortiz writes in the book's introduction.\n\nJuan González, a New York Daily News columnist from Puerto Rico, originally published \"Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America\" in 2000 , and in 2022, the first new edition of the book was published. The book spans five centuries - from the European colonization of the Americas through the 2020 election.\n\n\"The Devil's Highway\" by Mexican American poet and novelist Luis Alberto Urrea tells the real-life account of a group of 26 men and boys who, in 2001, attempted to cross the Mexican border into the desert of southern Arizona through the deadliest region of the continent.

      "text": "In California's 2020 primary, Latino voters could help Democrats defeat President Trump\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - On a recent Sunday, Victor Garcia left his Silicon Valley apartment and traveled an hour north to attend a rally by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang .\n\nGarcia, a 20-year-old political science major, is eager to vote both in the November 2020 election and in California's moved-up primary on March 3. But as curious as he is about Yang, a passionate proponent of a monthly $1,000 Universal Basic Income payment, Garcia is still candidate-shopping. He wants to see which politician is most attuned to issues that concern the state's growing Latino population .\n\n\"This election is really important,\" Garcia says as a largely youthful crowd gathers at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco ahead of Yang's speech. \"That said, most candidates really aren't reaching out to us yet.\"\n\nWith California's earlier primary date giving the state newfound clout in choosing who takes on President Donald Trump, political experts say presidential hopefuls would do well to step up their courtship of the Golden State's increasingly powerful Latino voters.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, not only are Latinos the majority-minority, with 39% (or 15 million) of the state's 40 million residents, but they also represent roughly a third of the state's eligible voters (at 7.7 million).\n\nWhile Latino voter turnout lags that of other ethnicities - 45% of Latino adults are likely to vote, compared with 68% of whites, according to the Public Policy Institute of California - those numbers have been shifting.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, contests that traditionally draw fewer voters than general elections, Latino voter turnout hit 36%, a doubling from 2014 that helped California Democratic candidates flip seven perennially Republican House seats.\n\nAnd Latino turnout expectations are heightened for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAt play not only are robust voter registration efforts aimed at a heavily Democratic constituency - 58% register as Democrats, compared with 15% who register as Republicans - but also a powerful resentment of Trump, whose disapproval rating hovers at 70% among Latinos, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 13 statewide Latino Decisions poll commissioned by the Latino Community Foundation, 74% of registered Latino voters say they plan to vote in the March 3 primary. Concerns about racism was cited by 76% of respondents.\n\nThe poll also reveals that 31% planned to vote for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 11% for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro came in at 9%, and California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 8%.\n\n\"The message we want all Latinos to hear is that they have the power to determine who is going to run against Trump and who will win in November,\" says Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO of San Francisco- based Latino Community Foundation, which is working to get out the Latino vote across the state.\n\n\"The political climate we are in has awoken a new generation of voters,\" she says. \"I hate the term sleeping giant, because we've been working, not sleeping. Now the candidates have to engage.\"\n\nDemocrats making a run for the White House will have an opportunity to lock in Garcia's vote on Nov. 16 in Long Beach, California, site of a televised Univision forum that will include Harris, Warren, Sanders, Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Yang.\n\nThe event represents a rare in-state gathering by candidates who by and large have been visiting California mostly for lucrative private fundraising trips. Many have so far focused their campaigning on Iowa and other early battleground states.\n\nIn fact, Biden has skipped all events hosted by the state's Democratic Party -  but has attended posh donor events up and down the state. He recently announced he would not be at the state's party convention in Long Beach Nov. 15 through 17.\n\nRounding out the Univision forum's field of eight - and serving as last-minute replacements for original invitees Biden, Warren and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who ended his once-promising campaign Nov. 1 - will be billionaire Tom Steyer, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nThe cost of not grabbing the attention of Latinos across the state is high, says Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California's Sol Price School of Public Policy.\n\n\"A presidential candidate cannot win California without getting a very significant portion of the Latino population , so ignoring outreach here is a huge strategic mistake,\" Romero says.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the campaigns of all those initially invited to the upcoming Univision forum to talk about Latino voters in California. Yang's team was the only one to arrange an interview.\n\n\"As a child of immigrants, I appreciate that communities may have unique issues,\" Yang tells USA TODAY in a makeshift greenroom just off Mission Street that by night is a chic cocktail bar. \"But my campaign focuses on topics that affect all of us.\"\n\nYang says that by highlighting the coming negative effects of automation on retail, transportation and food service jobs, he is in fact directly addressing the concerns of Latino voters.\n\n\"Many communities will be adversely affected by this coming economic natural disaster,\" Yang says. \"But those who will suffer the most will be people of color.\"\n\nSo who has the edge? A recent Telemundo poll of Latino voters nationally showed Biden leading with 26%, followed by Sanders at 18% and Warren at 10%. The next closest was Harris at 3%. But 36% of Latino voters said they were undecided.\n\nThose findings largely were borne out in conversations with a range of California Latino leaders, from the state's top law enforcement official to a popular radio deejay.\n\n\"Most Latinos certainly know who Joe Biden is, so he'll get solid support, especially from the older generation,\" says Xavier Becerra, the state's first Latino attorney general. His office has sued the Trump administration more than 60 times on a range of issues.\n\nBecerra says that for many Latino voters, name recognition is key.\n\n\"Four years ago, I was campaigning for Hillary (Clinton) and Sanders was having a tough time gaining traction with Latinos, and now he's way up there,\" he says. \"What that shows is Latinos, like others, want to know who you are before they turn to you.\"\n\nInterest in Sanders and Warren indicates Latinos are \"trending on the progressive side, which makes sense when you see the growth of younger voters,\" Becerra says.\n\nCurrently, 44% of eligible Latino voters are in the millennial age bracket, 18 to 33, according to Pew.\n\nChuy Gomez, a longtime Bay Area radio broadcaster, often has the ear of younger Latino voters.\n\n\"A lot of people I speak with want Bernie in,\" Gomez says. \"He speaks to the common folks, the workers. He's anti-rich.\"\n\nAssemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who is also chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, has endorsed Warren.\n\n\"She talks about bread and butter issues in a Midwest way, but it's all about paying the rent, getting more power as a worker, and our community relates to those issues,\" she says.\n\nWhen asked about Julian Castro, the lone Latino in the shrinking cluster of Democratic candidates, many say that while Latinos instantly relate to a man with a familiar last name and life story, that doesn't necessarily mean he has their vote.\n\n\"We want Castro in the race because he lives like us and represents us, so him being president is secondary to him just being on that stage,\" Gonzalez says. \"We should be an example for the nation. We were scapegoated by this president as a way to win the last election. So we want to help galvanize Latinos everywhere to vote.\"\n\nPolitical pundits often like to talk about voters being driven largely by specific issues. But conversations with Latinos make it clear this is not a monolithic group.\n\nIn fact, they hold a range of views, from progressive to conservative, and care about a rainbow of issues ranging from income inequality to climate change.\n\n\"There is no issue that is not a Latino issue,\" says Alex Padilla, California's secretary of state who is also the first Latino to hold that position. \"We want what everyone else wants. An opportunity for a good-paying job, access to health care, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing. Our dream is the American dream.\"\n\nPadilla says many Latinos see that dream as increasingly under threat by the Trump administration, which has appealed to its base by attacking illegal immigration and calling for tougher security at the Mexican border.\n\nThat, however, has served only to galvanize Latinos in a way that reminds Padilla of California's Proposition 187, which was passed by the state's voters 25 years ago this month.\n\nProp 187 denied undocumented immigrants access to health care and education. Although a day later the proposition was ruled unconstitutional, it created a movement that eventually saw 1 million California Latinos become citizens and arguably launched the ethnic group on a path toward increased power at the polls.\n\nLatino political activists agree that while the debate over illegal immigration is deeply upsetting to Latinos, candidates would be making a mistake if they focused their messaging on this one topic.\n\n\"It's very important for these candidates to understand that it is not the case that if you know what one Latino wants, you know what we all want,\" says Latino Community Foundation CEO Martinez Garcel.\n\n\"For example, I'm a Dominican from New York, so when I hear AOC (progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) speak, I don't hear socialism, I hear policies that care about the poor,\" she says. \"You have to know who you're talking to.\"\n\nAnother mistake for candidates would be displaying a level of sympathy that teeters into pity.\n\n\"Sometimes presidential candidates don't talk about Latinos in uplifting ways but just as victims, and we need to challenge that image,\" says Sarah Souza, president of the San Francisco Latino Democratic Club, the first DACA recipient (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), or \"Dreamer,\" to be appointed to the post.\n\nSouza, who originally is from Brazil, says candidates who push for access to home ownership and financial resources for Latinos will find a ready audience.\n\n\"We want economic opportunities just like everyone else,\" says Souza, adding that she supports Castro, Sanders and Warren. \"They're the most progressive and have an agenda that is for people of color, a group that has long been a target when it comes to economic equity.\"\n\nFor Alma Beltran, mayor of Parlier, California, just south of the agricultural mecca of Fresno, the upcoming primary and general election are about restoring opportunity and dignity to the lives of her 15,000 constituents - 98.8% of whom are Latino, including her and the entire City Council.\n\nThough times are tough in Parlier because of scarce economic opportunities and looming water quality issues, Beltran finds encouragement in the younger generation.\n\n\"I talk to some people who will say 'It won't make a difference if I vote,' but then I run into young people like my son, who is 17 and told me when he gets older he wants to run for office,\" Beltran says. \"You think maybe they don't understand what's going on, but they're watching. They're the people who will make a difference.\"\n\nThe crowd waiting for Yang at Civic Center Plaza is in fact mostly younger. Signs invariably tout the merits of his basic income plan, while most of the baseball caps say, \"MATH,\" a play off Trump's MAGA slogan that stands for Make America Think Harder.\n\nMarching with a smile is Eliana Jaramillo. Her large sign features a cartoon drawing of Yang as Uncle Sam, and in Spanish it reads, \"Universal Basic Income: I want you to have $1,000 a month.\"\n\nJaramillo says she was drawn to Yang's campaign specifically because that kind of stipend would have allowed her and her two children to flee an abusive relationship sooner.\n\n\"I'm marching in the hope that other women don't have to go through what I did,\" she says.\n\nNearby, Milo Alvarez bops up and down on his toes as he tries to get his infant son to sleep in his chest-mounted sling.\n\n\"I was a Bernie fan, but now I like Yang because I love this idea of a universal basic income,\" says Alvarez, a scooter repairman from Daly City just south of San Francisco.\n\nAlvarez reels off the other issues that are important to him, including health care and climate change. He says he doesn't particularly mind if candidates don't appeal to him specifically as a Latino.\n\n\"I care about the issues, which cut across a lot of ethnicities,\" he says.\n\nWhether a broad political appeal, like that made by Yang, will be enough to woo California's Latino voters come the elections in March and November remains to be seen.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Padilla suggests it may not be.\n\n\"You cannot compete in California without paying deep respect and responding to the Latino community,\" he says. \"Bottom line.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava"

      "text": "'Latinx' explained: A history of the controversial word and how to pronounce it\n\nWhen Senator Elizabeth Warren used \"Latinx\" in her opening remarks during the first Democratic debate Wednesday, it was one of the highest profile uses of the term since its conception.\n\nIt was also the first time many people heard the term and it probably won't be the last as the candidates attempt to target young, progressive voters in their campaigns.\n\nAnd while some public figures and politicians are quickly adapting to the term, others within the Latin American community are trying to resist it.\n\nSo what does \"Latinx\" mean and why is there so much controversy surrounding it?\n\n\"Latinx\" is a gender-neutral term used in lieu of \"Latino\" or \"Latina\" to refer to a person of Latin American descent.\n\nUsing the term \"Latinx\" to refer to all people of Latin American decent has become more common as members in the LGBTQ community and its advocates have embraced the label. The gendered structure of the Spanish language has made \"Latinx\" both an inclusive and controversial term.\n\nPronounced \"luh-TEE-neks,\" Merriam-Webster dictionary added the word in 2018 to describe those of Latin American descent who don't want to be identified by gender, or who don't identify as being male or female.\n\nThe word was created as a gender-neutral alternative to \"Latinos,\" not only to better include those who are gender fluid, but also to push back on the inherently masculine term used to describe all genders in the Spanish language.\n\nEven though \"Latinos\" technically refers to all genders of Latin American descent, it's still a masculine word in Spanish.\n\nFor example, a group of females would be called \"Latinas\" and a group of males would be called \"Latinos.\" However, a group of males and females of Latin American descent would revert to the masculine \"Latinos.\"\n\nGeorge Cadava, Director of the Latina and Latino Studies program at Northwestern University, said terms to describe Latin Americans in the U.S. have constantly been evolving over the course of history. \"Latinos\" gained popularity as a rejection of the word \"Hispanic,\" which many argued was imposed by the government.\n\n\"Latinx is an even further evolution that was meant to be inclusive of people who are queer or lesbian or gay or transgender,\" said Cadava. \"In some cases, it was a rejection of binary gender politics.\"\n\nMany believe that the patriarchal nature of the Romantic language is not inclusive and can't keep up with societal progress, as explained by this Twitter thread by investigative immigration reporter Aura Bogado.\n\nHowever, as \"Latinx\" grows in popularity, it also becomes more controversial within the Latin American community. The word was rejected in 2018 by the Real Academia Española , the official source on the Spanish language. Many who agree with this decision believe it is important to conserve the language, which is spoken by over 500 million people, according to a 2017 report by the Cervantes Institute in Spain.\n\nAnother argument against \"Latinx\" is that it erases feminist movements in the 1970s that fought to represent women with the word \"Latina,\" Cadava said.\n\nThis controversy is similar to one that surrounded the word \"Hispanic,\" which was first introduced by the Nixon administration on the 1970 census.\n\n\"People will say that it was an imposed term rather than something embraced by the community itself,\" Cadava said. He added that some argue the word \"Hispanic\" is a nod towards Spanish colonialism and shouldn't be interchangeable with Latinx/Latino/Latina.\n\nHowever, the university professor said his studies found most Hispanic Republicans prefer the word when describing their families. Democrats, on the other hand, tend to use more progressive terms like \"Latinos\" and more recently \"Latinx.\"\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, people of Latin American decent tend to identify first with their country of heritage and then second as \"Latino/Latina/Latinx\" or \"Hispanic\" to identify with a collective group, according to Dr. Rubén Martinez, director of the Julian Samora Research Institute at Michigan State University.\n\nFor example, a person's family who is from Mexico will typically identify as \"Mexican-American\" before identifying as \"Latino/Latina/Latinx\" or \"Hispanic.\"\n\nThe U.S. Census still uses \"Hispanic\" and defines it as the \"heritage, nationality, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before arriving in the United States.\""
