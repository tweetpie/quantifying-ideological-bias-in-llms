      "text": "'Profound disappointment': Fani Wills' primary challenger warned her not to hire Nathan Wade\n\nFulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis was recently removed as prosecutor in President-elect Donald Trump's election interference case. The man who ran against her in the Democratic primary is now saying she could have avoided that result had she heeded his advice.\n\nIn an op-ed for MSNBC , Christian Wise Smith - a former assistant district attorney for Fulton County - argued that Willis' dismissal as lead prosecutor was her own fault. He wrote that her decision to hire Nathan Wade as special prosecutor may have doomed not just her prosecution of the case, but the case itself. He described the Georgia Court of Appeals' disqualification of Willis as both a \"legal setback\" and \"a profound disappointment for our justice system and the citizens of Fulton County.\"\n\n\"I understand the immense responsibility that comes with wielding prosecutorial power,\" Smith wrote. \"Public trust isn't just earned through the cases we choose to pursue, but it's also earned in the way we conduct ourselves and manage our offices.\"\n\nSmith recalled a conversation he had with Willis about Wade - whom she briefly dated - in which he confided to her that hiring him was a \"waste of resources\" given his seven-figure pay package for his work on the case. He also reportedly told her that he knew of multiple qualified attorneys who were just as able to do the work that had been assigned to Wade.\n\n\"When you pay one attorney $1 million to handle a case, it hurts everyone else in Fulton County,\" Smith recalled telling Willis. He added that it was important to prosecute Trump and his co-defendants while being mindful to address \"everything else affecting Fulton [County].\"\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision earlier this week that Willis' romantic relationship with Wade created an appearance of impropriety that required her removal from the case as prosecutor. The decision of whether to continue prosecuting the case or drop it entirely will now rest in the hands of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia (PACGA), unless Willis successfully appeals her disqualification to the Georgia Supreme Court. However, Atlanta-based criminal defense attorney Andrew Fleischman posted to Bluesky that the PACGA continuing the case was unlikely given that it declined to continue prosecuting a case earlier this year after a prosecutor's recusal.\n\n\"The citizens of Fulton County deserved better. We deserved prosecutions that would stand or fall on the merits of evidence, not collapse due to preventable personal conflicts of interest,\" Smith wrote. \"Moving forward, the Trump case should serve as a stark reminder that the integrity of our justice system depends not just on what we do, but how we do it. Prosecutors should be beyond reproach and must maintain the highest ethical standards, especially in high-profile cases where public trust is paramount."

      "text": "Nathan Wade should step down from Fulton Co. case even if he isn't disqualified: experts\n\nSpecial prosecutor Nathan Wade - who admitted on the witness stand last week to briefly dating Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis - should recuse himself from the prosecution of former President Donald Trump and his associates to preserve the integrity of the investigation, according to a recent column by two legal experts.\n\nIn a column for the legal publication Lawfare , Harvard-educated lawyer Anna Bower and editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes both argued that while there is no basis to disqualify Willis based on the evidence brought by an attorney representing one of Trump's co-defendants, the lingering questions surrounding Wade and his relationship with Willis are a distraction from the historic and unprecedented RICO prosecution of the 45th president of the United States. They clarify that Wade's dismissal is still necessary even if Judge Scott McAfee - who is overseeing the proceedings - doesn't disqualify Willis and Wade from the case.\n\n\"While the evidence does not support disqualifying the office or Willis, Wade has displayed a sufficient lack of candor with the courts that he is not a credible figure to continue to represent the state in this case,\" Bowers and Wittes wrote. \"While this conduct doesn't create the conflict of interest that the defendants alleged in their motion, it does taint the prosecution if he remains involved with it. Willis herself needs to remove Wade from her team, even if McAfee finds no basis to do so.\"\n\nThe authors continued by pointing out that Wade lacks the credibility needed to remain on Willis' team. They observed that during Wade's testimony, he contradicted an earlier statement he made during his divorce proceedings. In May of 2023, when asked about any extramarital affairs he had in between the time of separation up to the present, he said there were \"none.\" However, Wade admitted under oath last week to having sex with Willis during that time frame.\n\n\"Quite apart from the question of whether any sort of conflict of interest arises out of Wade's relationship with Willis, this kind of failure of candor with the court is unbefitting a prosecutorial office, and Willis tolerates it at no small peril to her office's credibility,\" Bower and Wittes wrote.\n\nThey also both noted that Judge McAfee said that he may apply a more broad definition of a \"conflict of interest\" when issuing his ruling on whether there was indeed a conflict meriting disqualification as attorney Ashleigh Merchant - who represents Trump co-defendant Michael Roman - previously alleged. In Georgia, disqualification is typically granted if petitioners can demonstrate \"more than a theoretical or speculative conflict.\" However, McAfee said last week that \"disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.\"\n\n\"Assuming he is not going to disqualify [Willis], Judge McAfee will likely want to act swiftly to get the case back on track,\" the authors wrote. \"Willis should help him do that by taking Wade off the case.\""

      "text": "Fani Willis admits to relationship with Nathan Wade but dismisses 'irrelevant allegations'\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has admitted to a personal relationship with a coworker, but insists there's no wrongdoing and is remaining steadfast in her commitment to continue prosecuting former President Donald Trump .\n\nFriday marked the deadline for Willis to respond to allegations of impropriety lodged by Ashleigh Merchant, who is an attorney for Trump co-defendant Mike Roman. Those allegations were inflamed after bank records from Wade's divorce proceedings showed evidence he purchased airline tickets for he and Willis to San Francisco and Aruba. Roman's attorney accused Willis of a possible conflict of interest in her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, and attempted to argue that their relationship was grounds to have them dismissed as prosecutors.\n\nHowever, according to Atlanta-area news outlet WSB , Willis had no such relationship with Wade at the time of his appointment as special prosecutor in 2021. And she maintains that even though the two have since started dating, the integrity of the case itself has not been compromised.\n\n\"[The] attacks on Special Prosecutor Wade's qualifications are factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious, in addition to providing no basis whatsoever to dismiss the indictment or disqualify Special Prosecutor Wade,\" Willis wrote in her response, adding that she has \"no personal conflict of interest that justifies her disqualification personally or that of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office.\"\n\nWillis' Friday filing also dismissed Merchant's allegations as a hodgepodge of \"unremarkable circumstances of Special Prosecutor Wade's appointment with completely irrelevant allegations about his personal family life into a manufactured conflict of interest on the part of the District Attorney,\" and reiterated that the call to disqualify her from prosecuting the case was \"meritless.\"\n\nFollowing Willis' filing, both her office and Merchant will participate in a televised hearing on February 15, where Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee - who is overseeing Willis' RICO case - will make a determination on whether Merchant's allegations of inappropriate behavior are valid.\n\nSince indicting Trump and over a dozen co-defendants last year, Willis has secured guilty pleas from several participants in the alleged conspiracy, including Trump attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell. Other notable co-defendants include former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and January 6 architect John Eastman.\n\nRead WSB's full report here ."

This relationship is the basis of demands from Trump's co-defendants that Willis be removed from the case."

      "text": "New Biden campaign ad puts focus on Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nAs part of its $50 million July ad push, President Joe Biden's reelection campaign is releasing a new ad Monday that focuses on former President Donald Trump's role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn landmark abortion ruling Roe v. Wade.\n\nViewed by the Capital-Star ahead of its wider release, the 30-second spo t, titled \"Her Own,\" uses Trump's comments from the June 27 presidential debate, where he called appointing the justices who helped \"kill\" Roe v. Wade \"a great thing.\" It will run on digital TV in battleground states.\n\nHer Own | Biden-Harris 2024 www.youtube.com\n\n\"Ask yourself, who do you want in the White House: The man proud to overturn Roe v. Wade, or the President fighting for your rights?\" the voiceover asks.\n\nA screen capture from the new Biden campaign ad \"Her Own.\"\n\nThe issue of abortion access has been energizing for the Democratic base, but Biden gave somewhat confusing answers to questions about abortion and Roe v. Wade during the debate . The campaign has tried to demonstrate the consequences of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision for women who have had to navigate the new patchwork of state abortion laws to receive care.\n\n\"If Trump is reelected, he will go even further - punishing women who receive an abortion, banning abortion nationwide, and carrying out the rest of the extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement Monday. \"The only thing standing between American women and Trump's cruel attacks on reproductive health care is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nWhile he has boasted about appointing the three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, Trump said during the debate he believes in abortion ban exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But in February he reportedly expressed support for a nationwide abortion ban, and during an interview with a Pittsburgh TV news station in May, Trump hinted that he might be open to states limiting or banning access to contraception, though he walked back his remarks the same day in a social media post.\n\nThe new Biden campaign ad also seeks to continue its focus on linking Trump to Project 2025 , , a conservative policy proposal that would, among other things, hinder abortion and contraception access . Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 in a social media post last week.\n\nThe ad comes as Biden brushes aside suggestions he should step aside as Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee, after his shaky debate performance. The president campaigned in Pennsylvania on Sunday , speaking at a church in Philadelphia and a union gathering in Harrisburg as he tried to reassure voters he was up to the job.\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak in Pennsylvania on Saturday at a rally in Butler, north of Pittsburgh, two days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nPennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "'Getting ugly': Ex-federal prosecutor urges Fani Willis to 'disqualify' herself from Trump case\n\nOn Thursday, February 15 in an Atlanta courtroom, Nathan Wade - a special prosecutor for the Fulton County District Attorney's office - testified about his romantic relationship with DA Fani Willis .\n\nThe hearing could determine whether or not Willis, in light of her relationship with Wade, should remain in charge of her election interference/RICO case against former President Donald Trump and a long list of allies.\n\nWhen the court held an early afternoon recess, MSNBC brought on a legal panel to discuss the possible repercussions of Wade's testimony. And the legal analysts - including Katie Phang, defense attorney Caroline Polisi and former federal prosecutor Chuck Rosenberg - agreed that Willis' role as lead prosecutor in the case may be in danger.\n\nRosenberg told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell , \"This is not going well for the State (of Georgia).... It might be appropriate for Ms. Willis to consider removing herself from this case now and turning the reins over to a senior official in the (Fulton County) District Attorney's Office and have him or her handle it. Because this is getting ugly, it's getting messy, and my guess is this will not get better.\"\n\nPolisi said of Wade's testimony , \"This has been a bombshell. It was sort of a slow burn, but if you parse the language: huge, huge issues here. I want to be really clear: This is not about a relationship between two consenting adults. This has nothing to do with that.... The issue is that her credibility is shot.... If she lied to the court, she submitted something to the court that she knew was false and inaccurate, what else was she lying about?\"\n\nPolisi continued , \"It's a horrible, horrible look for her. I think this case is dead in the water. She will be disqualified. The case will then.... have to be reassigned to another prosecutor's office. Likely, it will languish there for months. I think it's over. I think the case is over.\"\n\nPhang emphasized that if Willis steps down from the case against Trump, a whole new team may need to be put in place in order for the prosecution to continue.\n\nAccording to Phang, \"It could rise to the level of disqualification .... If Fani Willis is disqualified, the whole team is gone.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link :"

      "text": "How overturning Roe v. Wade led to the Supreme Court's 'obvious departure from collegiality of years past'\n\nOver the years, for the most part, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) have maintained amicable interpersonal relationships with one another. But after the reign of former president Donald Trump, and with an increasingly conservative Supreme Court panel of judges, that has changed.\n\nSteven Mazie, SCOTUS correspondent at The Economist , recently reflected on his last ten years of covering Supreme Court cases in an op-ed for The Atlantic , in which he highlights the drastic shift in the working relationship between the justices.\n\nHaving observed oral arguments since 2013, Mazie has gained an understanding of the outward appearance of the justices' dynamics over time. From the sustained camaraderie between former Justice Stephen Breyer and current Justice Clarence Thomas despite their moral differences, to the assistance Justice Thomas would offer to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her declining health, the justices always remained on good terms.\n\nEven through disagreements over a church-state case, same-sex marriage, the Affordable Care Act, voting rights, labor unions and abortion, it became clear to Mazie that, no matter the circumstances or differences of opinion, \"peace prevailed\" and \"civility reigned.\"\n\nHowever, that seemed to change once Roe v. Wade was overturned following the leak of Justice Alito's opinion in June 2022. Not only has the friendly relationship between the justices become noticeable for onlookers, but according to Mazie, the justices are \"sometimes bordering on disrespect.\"\n\nAlthough not apparent every day, the panel of justices have developed a tension that was not there before Trump tipped the court further right.\n\n\"The Supreme Court that Donald Trump reshaped isn't simply more conservative; it's also much more strained,\" Mazie wrote, adding that the nine justices are now charged with navigating a relationship of which any \"manager would be concerned.\"\n\nThe tension on the Court continued past the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June and carried on throughout the summer and fall. The Court is currently facing charges that question its legitimacy following the Roe v. Wade opinion leak . And, as the court becomes more \"partisan\" in its rulings, Justice Elena Kagan recently said \"Americans are bound to lose confidence in a Court that looks 'like an extension of the political process.'\" In staunch disagreement of questions surroudning the Court's legitimacy, Justice Samuel Alito has claimed that anyone who says SCOTUS is \"becoming an illegitimate institution\" is questioning the justices' \"integrity\".\n\nAs the justices reckon with their relationship in the courtroom, the \"worry\" around their \"fractured relationships\" remains pressing. Afterall,  the rights of millions of Americans are at stake."

      "text": "Fani Willis questions if Trump 'legally' obtained her cellphone data in her latest filing\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has filed her official response to former President Donald Trump's allegations that she and special prosecutor Nathan Wade lied on the stand about their relationship.\n\nTrump worked with a Georgia-based private investigator to submit a filing on Friday showing that Wade visited Willis' home approximately 35 times in 2021 according to cell tower data. In an evidentiary hearing earlier this month, Both Willis and Wade testified that they did not begin dating until 2022, several months after Wade was hired onto her team in November of 2021. But Willis is now alleging in her new filing that not only do the latest allegations \"not prove, in any way, the content of the communications\" or that the two were in the same place at the same time, but that Trump may have broken the law in obtaining the data used to make the allegations.\n\n\"Moreover, the state questions whether Defendant Trump legally obtained cell site location information, which is generally only obtainable after a finding of probable cause and issuance of a search warrant,\" read the filing , which was tweeted by MSNBC host Katie Phang.\n\nWillis' RICO investigation of the former president has been sidetracked since attorney Ashleigh Merchant - who is representing Trump co-defendant Michael Roman - alleged that both she and Wade had an improper relationship that constituted a conflict of interest meriting disqualification. Merchant's allegations resulted in Judge Scott McAfee scheduling two days of questioning in which both Merchant and other attorneys for defendants Willis is prosecuting peppered the prosecutor with personal questions about the nature of her relationship with her colleague.\n\nDuring her time on the stand, Willis accused Merchant of lying about her in various filings submitted to the court, and forcefully pushed back on the suggestion that she had supposedly misused public money when taking various trips with Wade while the two were romantically involved.\n\n\"You're confused. You think I'm on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020. I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,\" Willis said on the stand .\n\nMcAfee has scheduled another hearing for March 1, which may be the final hearing before he issues his decision on whether Willis and Wade should be disqualified from prosecuting the case."

Sign up here .\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - N.C. State has made it official: McNeese's Will Wade is the Wolfpack's new men's basketball coach.\n\nThe school announced the hiring Sunday , coming a day after Wade's McNeese team lost to Purdue in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAn introductory news conference for Wade is scheduled for Tuesday, capping a week in which Wade was unusually open about his conversations with N.C. State compared to coaches typically deflecting questions or playing word games when asked about other jobs.\n\nIn that regard, the eventual hiring - who has signed a six-year deal - has been an open secret for days. The contract is pending approval from the university trustees.\n\nNow N.C. State and athletic director Boo Corrigan finally have their man.\n\n\"Will told me that he believes that he can win at NC State ... and 'win big,\"'\" Corrigan said in a statement from the school. \"It didn't take me too many conversations with him to believe it too.\"\n\nWade's second NCAA Tournament run in as many seasons with the Cowboys ended Saturday with a second-round loss to Purdue , which came two days after a first-round upset of his alma mater, Clemson. Wade's two-year tenure in Lake Charles, Louisiana, marked a successful climb back after being fired at LSU in 2022 because of allegations of recruiting violations. Those were rooted in a federal corruption investigation in college basketball that became public in 2017, with N.C. State among the multiple schools entangled in that probe.\n\nThe N.C. State job will present a new challenge. It comes in the Atlantic Coast Conference in a time of transition for the tradition-rich league, with numerous long-time coaches - North Carolina's Roy Williams, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, Virginia's Tony Bennett, Notre Dame's Mike Brey, Miami's Jim Larranaga and Florida State's Leonard Hamilton - all exiting in the past four years amid a rapidly changing college landscape.\n\nThere's also the tough-neighborhood dynamic of building a winning program in the Triangle region in North Carolina, where UNC, Duke and N.C. State - boasting a combined 13 NCAA championships - share the 919 area code and are all within a half-hour's drive of one another.\n\nBut the 42-year-old Wade is clearly undeterred by that with a track record that includes eight 20-win seasons in his 11 years as a head coach.\n\n\"I am beyond excited and honored to be chosen to lead the Wolfpack basketball program,\" Wade said in a statement. \"N.C. State's rich tradition, passionate fan base, and location in one of the best cities in the country make this a destination job and I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nWade replaces Kevin Keatts, who was fired after eight seasons on March 9 . That came less than a year after Keatts guided N.C. State to its first Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament title since 1987 and its first Final Four trip since the late Jim Valvano's \"Cardiac Pack\" did it in an improbable 1983 NCAA title run.\n\nKeatts had guided N.C. State to three NCAA bids and had the program in position for another when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of March Madness in 2020. But the Wolfpack went 12-19 this season to kill any lingering buzz from last year's remarkable run.\n\nThat ultimately led the school to move on from Keatts even though he was under contract until April 2030, putting N.C. State on the hook for roughly $6.9 million in base salary alone. And it marked a reset for the program, down to how it handles finances for roster construction with players able to profit from their athletic fame and revenue sharing set to start nationally next season.\n\nWade's first head-coaching job was a two-year stint at Chattanooga from 2013-15, followed by two NCAA bids in as many seasons at VCU before leaving for LSU in 2017 . The peak of his tenure with the Tigers came in his second season, with LSU winning the Southeastern Conference regular-season title and reaching the Sweet 16.\n\nHe returned to the sideline after his LSU exit at McNeese in 2023, with his tenure beginning with NCAA penalties that included a 10-game suspension to open his first season . But the Cowboys teams went on to win 58 games in two seasons, a rapid climb for a program that had won just 56 games combined in the five seasons before Wade's arrival.\n\n___\n\nAP March Madness bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness .

The feedback to the statue had him playing defense.\n\nWade explained the statue's look and the process of creating it on Monday, one day after the Heat unveiled the tribute . The statue - with a face that, to put it mildly, isn't a perfect depiction of Wade - was immediately a talking point, trending globally on social media and even getting mentioned on national newscasts.\n\n\"If I wanted it to look like me, I'd just stand outside the arena and y'all can take photos,\" Wade said Monday. \"It don't need to look like me. It's the artistic version of a moment that happened that we're trying to cement.\"\n\nThat moment was the end of a game against the Chicago Bulls in March 2009, when he made a shot to win at the buzzer of double overtime, hopped up onto a courtside table and yelled, \"This is my house.\" The position of his hands in the statue are reminiscent of that moment. But it's the face that has generated almost all of the feedback.\n\n\"I care, but I don't,\" Wade said. \"The social media world is about opinions. Everyone has an opinion. Everyone, use y'all opinions. Please talk more about us. Talk more about a statue, come on down to see it, take some photos, send some memes. We don't care.\"\n\nLater Monday, in a halftime ceremony during the Miami-Detroit game - played on the 21st anniversary of Wade's debut with the Heat - Wade told the crowd that the statue was for them as well. He also continued to defend the work, saying that the statue doesn't depict a human body and calling it \"art at its finest.\"\n\n\"There's only a few organizations that have a statue outside. There's not even 15 players who played this game of basketball that have a statue outside. We - we - have a statue outside,\" Wade told the crowd. \"So, for me to be the vessel that's used, to be the chosen one, I'm proud of it. I'm proud because we worked very, very, very hard to create an image that will stand for a very long time that expresses what the Miami Heat, my family and our fan base is about.\n\n\"So, don't let nobody talk about our house. Because this is our house. They're on the outside. Leave them out there.\"\n\nSculptors said it took about 800 hours of work to make the statue, and Wade was directly involved with the process. Most people saw the statue for the first time Sunday; Wade had seen parts of it - including the face - along the way.\n\nHe lauded the work the sculptors did.\n\n\"I don't know a lot of people with a statue. Do you? Anybody here, y'all know anything about the process of a statue? No one out there do neither,\" Wade said. \"And so, it's an unbelievable process to be a part of. And it's a complicated process.\"\n\nWade - Miami's all-time leading scorer - is the first player in Heat history to get a statue. The team has not said definitively if it will add others in the coming years. Wade's statue unveiling was attended by many members of his family and many members of the Heat organization, among others.\n\n\"It was a great celebration for all of us,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"We love to celebrate greatness. We love to celebrate all these iconic players, iconic moments.\"\n\nWade said some of the memes he got a laugh about were the ones suggesting it looked more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the three-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer. He also said it's unfortunate that the artists were hearing negative feedback. Studio Rotblatt Amrany, a Chicago-area company, was contracted to create the Wade statue.\n\n\"Every time they create something, someone has to come out and say something about their creation. They cannot do what they do,\" Wade said. \"I know what that feels like because I'm an athlete, a former athlete. People talked about me a lot, but they couldn't do what I do. And so, you learn how to just laugh, look at it, learn from it, move on, whatever. So, we good. We good.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Sign up here .\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - McNeese coach Will Wade has a signed six-year deal to take over as N.C. State's next coach, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the school hasn't publicly discussed its coaching search.\n\nWade's second NCAA Tournament run in as many seasons with the Cowboys ended Saturday with a second-round loss to Purdue , which came two days after a first-round upset of his alma mater, Clemson. Wade's two-year tenure in Lake Charles, Louisiana, marked a successful climb back after being fired at LSU in 2022 because of allegations of recruiting violations. Those were rooted in a federal corruption investigation in college basketball that became public in 2017, with N.C. State among the multiple schools entangled in that probe.\n\nOG Media first reported earlier this week that the two sides had reached an agreement for Wade to lead the Wolfpack, while CBS Sports was first to report the signing after the Purdue loss. The 42-year-old Wade had confirmed talks with N.C. State before the Clemson win, an unusually candid response compared with coaches typically deflecting questions about other jobs.\n\n\"Just tell it like it is,\" Wade said Wednesday.\n\nAsked about the N.C. State job again after Saturday's loss to Purdue, Wade said: \"I'll worry about that tomorrow. Look, I'm an honest guy, but today I want to put a bow on everything with McNeese if we can.\"\n\nWade will replace Kevin Keatts, who was fired after eight seasons on March 9 . That came less than a year after he guided N.C. State to its first Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament title since 1987 and its first Final Four trip since the late Jim Valvano's \"Cardiac Pack\" did it in an improbable 1983 NCAA title run.\n\nKeatts had guided N.C. State to three NCAA bids and had the program in position for another when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of March Madness in 2020. But the Wolfpack went 12-19 this season to kill any lingering buzz from last year's remarkable run.\n\nThat ultimately led the school to move on from Keatts even though he was under contract until April 2030, putting N.C. State on the hook for roughly $6.9 million in base salary alone. And it marked a reset for the program, down to how it handles finances for roster construction with players able to profit from their athletic fame and revenue sharing set to start nationally next season.\n\nWade's first head-coaching job was a two-year stint at Chattanooga from 2013-15, followed by two NCAA bids in as many seasons at VCU before leaving for LSU in 2017 . The peak of his tenure with the Tigers came in his second season, with LSU winning the Southeastern Conference regular-season title and reaching the Sweet 16.\n\nHe returned to the sideline after his LSU exit at McNeese in 2023, with his tenure beginning with NCAA penalties that included a 10-game suspension to open his first season . But the Cowboys teams went on to win 58 games in two seasons, a rapid climb for a program that had won just 56 games combined in the five seasons before Wade's arrival.\n\n\"I think I needed somewhere that was going to embrace me and the town needed somebody to embrace them,\" Wade said Saturday of his McNeese tenure. \"It just worked. I can't explain how. I guess the winning helps, but it worked. Just unforgettable.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP March Madness bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness .

(AP) - NBA great Dwyane Wade was back in South Florida on Thursday to do battle again.\n\nThe Hall of Famer spent more than 14 seasons as a guard for the Miami Heat, winning three championships, having Miami-Dade County nicknamed \"Wade County,\" and he still leads the franchise in everything from points and rebounds to personal fouls. But the fight he outlined Thursday at The Elevate Prize Foundation's Make Good Famous Summit, after receiving the nonprofit's Elevate Prize Catalyst Award, may be the most personal of all.\n\n\"We've done so many great things here so it wasn't easy to leave,\" Wade told The Associated Press in an interview before the award ceremony. \"But the community wasn't here for Zaya, so the community wasn't here for us.\"\n\nWade's daughter, Zaya, who turns 17 next week, came out as transgender in 2020 in the midst of anti-trans legislation in Florida and other states that prompted many trans adults to flee the state . The Wade family sold their Florida home last year and moved to California.\n\nIn accepting the award, Wade shared it with Zaya and credited her with inspiring the creation of Translatable , a new online community designed to support transgender children and their families.\n\n\"The question was presented to her as, 'If you have one thing that you want to see change in this community, what would it be?',\" Wade recalled. \"And, for her, it goes right to parents. It goes right to the adults. It goes right to us. It's not the kids. It's us. And so she wanted to create a space that felt safe for parents and their kids. That's what Translatable is, and it's her baby.\"\n\nWade hopes Translatable, which is funded by the Wade Family Foundation, will provide a community to \"support growth, mental health, and well-being, and that this space ignites more conversations leading to greater understanding and acceptance.\" He said he will use the $250,000 in unrestricted funding that comes with The Elevate Prize Catalyst Award for Translatable.\n\nElevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said that after hearing Wade's plans, her nonprofit made a separate additional donation to Translatable, which was built with support from the Human Rights Campaign and The Trevor Project.\n\n\"Dwyane Wade and what he represents speaks to the ethos of the whole foundation,\" Jayaram told the AP. \"He is such a hero in the sports universe and even beyond basketball. He's been in the social justice space almost since the very beginning of his NBA career and most people don't know that.\"\n\nJayaram said that Wade felt empowered when Zaya came out as transgender in 2020 and it was \"so deeply inspirational to us that we were just dying to be a part of what he's building.\"\n\nThe Elevate Prize Catalyst Award helps its winners, who have included actors Matt Damon and Michael J. Fox and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai, to amplify their philanthropic work by using the foundation's resources and connections to inspire more donors and supporters.\n\nWade said his support of trans rights is a natural extension of being a parent and talked about how much he enjoys learning from Zaya in hourslong discussions at home. Jayaram said she was struck by Wade's devotion as a parent, but also commended his decision to launch Translatable in Florida, \"a place where many might feel a sense of exclusion.\"\n\n\"We understand that in this state that not everyone thinks the way some others think,\" Wade said. \"Like most things in life, once you get to know them, you have more ability to be understanding. And so if you don't want to know them, then you stay ignorant in a sense.\"\n\nComedian and \"Everything's Trash\" actress Phoebe Robinson, who interviewed Wade as part of the summit, said that she admired Wade for being outspoken on numerous issues.\n\n\"In a time when people are so worried about saying anything because they are only thinking about their bottom line, I think the fact that he's thinking about humanity first is amazing, really stressing the importance of connection and community to help protect people and help them grow and just blossom,\" Robinson said.\n\nAlexander Roque, executive director of the Ali Forney Center, which helps homeless LGBTQ+ youth, said Translatable comes at a critical time for transgender youth, with more than 500 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced this year.\n\n\"Not all bills turn into law, but they're all acts of hate that affect our kids in very devastating ways,\" he said. \"We know statistically that every time there's an anti-LGBTQ bill in the media, there's a 400% increase in calls to suicide hotlines by young people. We also know that we're seeing a significant increase in unhoused LGBTQ youth because of family rejection. So to have someone of this celebrity so invested in the community, it's helping to change the tide of what's happening to our kids and perhaps one of the most hopeful moments in what I hope is a changing tide.\"\n\nDr. Michelle Forcier, a clinician at FOLX Health, which provides health services for LGBTQIA+ people nationally, said creating an online community for trans youth is a specific program that would be helpful.\n\n\"Youth are all about electronic and online communication, socialization, and communities,\" she said. \"So if you are trying to support youth it only makes sense to be a part of how youth feel most comfortable communicating.\"\n\nThat this community comes from a celebrity ally makes it more impactful, Forcier said.\n\n\"The transgender and gender-diverse community does not have the deep pockets - including financial, political, and media resources - that the anti-transgender and anti-diversity political and advocacy community has,\" she said. \"To have a champion who shows up for some of our most vulnerable - transgender and gender-diverse youth and the families that care for them - that would be a truly heroic act and possibly change the game entirely.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Sign up here .\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - McNeese President Wade Rousse sat down with Will Wade when he hired him as basketball coach and laid out a two-year plan: Make the NCAA Tournament in the first year, and win a game in the second.\n\nAfter that, he figured, it might be tough to keep Wade around.\n\nAnd he's been right on all counts.\n\n\"I may never make another plan,\" Rousse said after the 12th-seeded Cowboys upset No. 5 seed Clemson 69-67 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday. \"Because that one turned out so well.\"\n\nTwo years after taking over at the Southland Conference school in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in an attempt to revive his career, Wade is moving on to NC State . To Rousse, that was always the risk in taking on someone who was one of the best young coaches in the sport before his career was sidetracked by scandal.\n\n\"We've had a plan for two years, and we've been transparent with one another,\" Rousse told The Associated Press in the hallways underneath the stands of the Amica Mutual Pavilion. \"We needed Coach. We kind of figured this is where we're going.\"\n\nThe Cowboys used a stifling first half to hold Clemson to 13 points, opening a 24-point lead before holding off a late charge to earn the school's first NCAA Tournament victory.\n\nNow, the Wolfpack will have to wait until McNeese's March Madness run is over.\n\nAnd Wade and his players say they won't have any problem concentrating on the second-round game against Purdue in the meantime.\n\n\"Everybody is aware of everything that's going on,\" McNeese forward Christian Shumate said. \"Everybody is transparent on both ends and that's something we worry about later. We're just focused on winning these games.\"\n\nWade helped LSU make the NCAA Tournament twice in four years, but he was fired in 2021 after being accused of recruiting violations. He took a year off, and then signed on with the school just down Interstate 10.\n\n\"They have gone all-in on our program since the day we got there,\" Wade said. \"They thought we were a little wacky when we did it. But, hey, who's laughing now?\"\n\nThe success has revived Wade's career and set him up for a job in the higher-profile Atlantic Coast Conference. (Rousse said the school is \"pretty far down the path\" of replacing him.) But it's also buttressed the profile of the 6,000-student school about halfway between New Orleans and Houston.\n\nRousse said applications are up 10% for the fall, the yield of students accepting offers is up three years in a row, and the school's website crashed at the final buzzer of Thursday's game.\n\n\"I said, 'I don't need a coach. I need someone who understands what our vision is and what our mission is.' And Coach is all-in on that,\" he said.\n\n\"We have been in an enrollment decline for 14, 15 years. We turned it last year. A large part of that has been our strategic plan to elevate the athletic program, to drive our academic program.\"\n\nWade recited the same statistics during his postgame news conference, and said he hoped the team's March Madness run will have a ripple effect throughout southwestern Louisiana.\n\nOne that won't go away when he does.\n\n\"This is huge for our school,\" he said. \"We got freaking $25 million in advertisements in the last couple of weeks. It's going through the roof.\"\n\n\"This changes our area, our five-parish area,\" he said. \"It changes everything.\"\n\n___\n\nAP March Madness bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness .

(AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe)\n\nOn June 24, 2022, The Supreme Court ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years - a decision by its conservative majority to overturn the court's landmark abortion cases. The outcome overturning Roe v. Wade was expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.\n\nIn 1497, the first recorded sighting of North America by a European took place as explorer John Cabot spotted land, probably in present-day Canada.\n\nIn 1509, Henry VIII was crowned king of England; his wife, Catherine of Aragon, was crowned queen consort.\n\nIn 1807, a grand jury in Richmond, Virginia, indicted former Vice President Aaron Burr on charges of treason and high misdemeanor (he was later acquitted).\n\nIn 1939, the Southeast Asian country Siam changed its name to Thailand. (It went back to being Siam in 1945, then became Thailand once again in 1949.)\n\nIn 1940, France signed an armistice with Italy during World War II.\n\nView of the tent at the disposal of the French delegation to the armistice conference in Compiegne.

An appeals court suspended Rudy Giuliani from practicing law in New York because he made false statements while trying to get courts to overturn Donald Trump's loss in the presidential race. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would create a special committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol; Senate Republicans had blocked legislation that would form a bipartisan commission to investigate the attack.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nJudges, state lawmakers and voters are deciding the future of abortion in the U.S. two years after the Supreme Court jolted the legal status quo with a ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe June 24, 2022, ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization sparked legislative action, protest and numerous lawsuits - placing the issue at the center of politics across the country.\n\nAbortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, in 14 Republican-controlled states. In three other states, it's barred after about the first six weeks, which is before many know they are pregnant. Most Democratic-led states have taken actions to protect abortion rights, and become sanctuaries for out-of-state patients seeking care.\n\nThat's changed the landscape of abortion access, making it more of a logistical and financial ordeal for many in conservative states. But it has not reduced the overall number of procedures done each month across the U.S.\n\nHere's what to know about the state of abortion rights in the U.S. now.\n\nBans in Republican-led states have prompted many people seeking abortions to travel to get care.\n\nThat translates into higher costs for gas or plane tickets, hotels and meals; more logistics to figure out, including child care; and more days off work.\n\nA new study by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for abortion access, found that out of just over a million abortions provided in clinics, hospitals and doctors' offices, more than 161,000 - or 16% - were for people who crossed state lines to get them.\n\nMore than two-thirds of abortions done in Kansas and New Mexico were for out-of-staters, particularly Texans.\n\nSince Florida's six-week abortion ban kicked in in May, many people had to travel farther than before, since throughout the Southeast, most states have bans.\n\nLow-income patients and those lacking legal permission to be in the country are more likely to be unable to travel. There can be lasting costs for those who do.\n\nIn Alabama, the Yellowhammer Fund, which previously helped residents pay for the procedure has paused doing so since facing threats of litigation from the state .\n\nJenice Fountain, Yellowhammer's executive director, said she met a woman recently who traveled from Alabama to neighboring Georgia for an abortion but found she couldn't get one there because she was slightly too far into her pregnancy. So she then went to Virginia. The journey wiped out her rent money and she needed help to remain housed.\n\n\"We're having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,\" Fountain said.\n\nFILE - People march through downtown Amarillo to protest a lawsuit to ban the abortion drug mifepristone, Feb. 11, 2023, in Amarillo, Texas. (AP Photo/Justin Rex, File)\n\nNearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures .\n\nOne report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They're sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans.\n\nThe growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs usually used together for medication abortions. The issue is likely to return .\n\nIn this presidential election year, abortion is a key issue.\n\nProtecting access has emerged as a key theme in the campaigns of Democrats, including President Joe Biden in his reelection bid . Former President Donald Trump , the presumptive Republican nominee, has said states should decide whether to restrict abortions. He also suggested states could limit contraception use but changed his tune on that.\n\n\"We recognize this could be the last Dobbs anniversary we celebrate,\" Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in an interview, noting that if Democrats win the presidency and regain control of both chambers of Congress, a right to abortion could be enshrined in the law.\n\nThe issue will also be put directly before voters in at least four states. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have ballot measures this year asking voters to approve state constitutional amendments that would protect or expand access to abortion. A New York measure would bar discrimination against someone who has an abortion. There are attempts to put questions about abortion access on the ballots this year in Arkansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Nevada.\n\nThere's also a push for a ballot measure in Arizona, where the state Supreme Court this year ruled that an 1864 abortion ban could be enforced. With the help of some Republicans - Democrats in the Legislature were able to repeal that law .\n\nGenerally, abortion rights expand when voters are deciding. In the seven statewide abortion policy-related votes since 2022, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates in every case.\n\nFILE - Paul Meacham holds high a sign that reads \"Ohio is pro-life\" as the crowd prays during the Ohio March for Life rally at the Ohio State House in Columbus, Ohio, Friday, Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nThe Dobbs ruling and its aftermath gave rise to a bevy of legal questions and lawsuits challenging nearly every ban and restriction.\n\nMany of those questions deal with how exceptions - which come into play far more often when abortion is barred earlier in pregnancy - should apply. The issue is often raised by those who wanted to be pregnant but who experienced life-threatening complications.\n\nA group of women who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions in Texas sued, claiming the state's ban is vague about which exceptions are allowed. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court disagreed in a May ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court also heard arguments in April on the federal government's lawsuit against Idaho, which says its ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy can extend to women in medical emergencies. The Biden administration says that violates federal law. A ruling on that case could be issued at any time.\n\nMeanwhile, bans have been put on hold by judges in Iowa, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Worst Statue in the History of Sports\n\nDwyane Wade deserves a do-over.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSunday was supposed to be one of the greatest days of Dwyane Wade's life. Back in January, Pat Riley, the longtime president of the Miami Heat, announced the team's plans to honor Wade with a statue, and now it was finally to be unveiled. This would not be like the comically small statue of Philadelphia 76ers legend Allen Iverson that had been erected outside that team's training complex in April. This would be a monument befitting the greatest player ever to wear a Heat uniform, according to Riley. It would dominate the entrance of the Kaseya Center, where the Heat play home games. Wade recognized the significance. A couple hundred players have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, he told the Today show before the event. But in the NBA, statues of this kind are reserved for all-time greats, guys even casual fans know by their first names: Kobe, Magic, Michael.\n\nAt the ceremony, Wade sat in the front row with his family, smiling warmly as Udonis Haslem, his teammate of 15 years, and then Riley, paid him tribute. The Heat's home games may be packed with South Beachers, Haslem said, but Wade brought joy to all of Miami. He name-checked Liberty City and Overtown, historically Black neighborhoods. Wade's grown son took the stage and said that Wade had always put fatherhood before basketball. They embraced. Wade wiped away tears. The moment of unveiling arrived. The eight-foot bronze statue was hidden behind large black panels. They slid open, flames shot out, and for a moment, a blast of fog obscured the figure's face, adding to the suspense.\n\nSuspense is what the tuned-in viewing public has learned to feel during these unveilings. Some have been well received. The naturalistic bronze statue of Michael Jordan at the United Center, in Chicago, is like a Jumpman logo made flesh, and then made metal. It looks elemental, like it could be worn down for millennia and still maintain its fundamental character. But there have been misses, too. Earlier this year, the Lakers unveiled a Kobe Bryant statue with oddly stretched proportions and a too-angular face. It made Bryant look like a second-rate Terminator villain, and to add insult to injury, the inscription at its base was marred by misspellings . In 2017, fans of Cristiano Ronaldo were so aghast at a sculptor's cartoonish bust of the legendary footballer that they hounded him into making a new one .\n\nIt gives me no pleasure-and, in fact, considerable pain-to report that Dwyane Wade's statue may be the worst of them all. Studio Rotblatt Amrany, the same firm that made Kobe's statue, put 800 hours of work into it, we are told. And yet, as a likeness of Wade, it does not even rise to the level of wax works from Madame Tussauds. Amid a mounting backlash, one of the sculptors has said that no one else could do any better, a claim that flies in the face of the whole history of sculpture.\n\nWade had asked the firm to memorialize a moment from Miami's 2008-09 season, which seems to have deepened his bond with the city. Having just hit a buzzer beater in double overtime against the Chicago Bulls, Wade jumped onto the scorer's table and screamed, \"This is my house\" to a euphoric home crowd. He was 27 years old. The statue gives him the thick, grizzled look of a man in his mid-50s. He seems to suffer from a rare elephantiasis, hyperlocal to the jaw. The eyes are all wrong. If Wade ever had to flee the country, and for some reason the detectives who pursued him overseas had only a cast of this statue to identify him, he would likely remain at large forever.\n\nRead: The secret code of pickup basketball\n\nIn the late 17th century, a Bernini statue so incensed Louis XIV that he demanded that it be destroyed. The Sun King was obsessed with his own image. Bernini rendered him as a Roman general on horseback, but at some point, for reasons that are lost to history, he chose to carve a smile into the king's face. Louis XIV must have found the smile out of keeping with the fearsome martial aura that he wished to project. He spared the statue, but had it moved to a distant section of the gardens at Versailles.\n\nI kept playing back the video of Wade's unveiling, to see if he might betray a similar flash of anger. I wouldn't have blamed him. The Associated Press reports that this was not his first time seeing it. He'd visited the sculptors multiple times while the statue was being produced, and had had a preview of its head. Maybe he'd reacted strongly then, before putting on a brave face for the cameras. Wade had to know that any wince or grimace would have worsened the social-media circus that was sure to come.\n\nRead: Air Jordan is finally deflating\n\nHe took a few tentative steps toward the statue, hands clasped in front of him. He stepped to its side, to look at it in profile. He was polite enough. When his family joined him, he appeared to be moved. In his remarks, he asked, of the statue: \"Who is that guy?\" Some news accounts of the unveiling have seized on this quote, but it was clearly made in a spirit of humility, as in: How did a guy like me, from such modest beginnings, end up on a pedestal?\n\nSome people believe that who you are on the basketball court is who you are in real life. That is a child's idea of wisdom, but in Wade's case, there is some truth to it. He was pure grace on the hardwood. At 6 foot 4, he wasn't one of the NBA's giants. Wade was an everyman, albeit a shifty one who could leap fearlessly toward the rim, pinball between larger defenders, and score. The most beautiful thing was the way that he landed, almost always cleanly, on two feet, in the relaxed way in which you might come to rest on the bottom step of the staircase in your childhood home.\n\nBy all accounts and appearances, Wade is just as graceful off the court. He certainly has the grace not to sour an event meant to honor him. Yesterday, after the statue had been memed nearly to death for 24 hours, Wade defended it, and stood up for the sculptors. He said that it doesn't need to look like him, because it's only an artistic expression of a particular moment. I think he deserved a better statue, but maybe, in the end, it was all his fault. Maybe his game was the problem. Maybe Wade moved too fluidly to ever be stilled in bronze."

      "text": "My Mother Was Wrong\n\nThe feminists who fought for Roe wanted to believe that their victory was forever. Now their granddaughters are poised to have fewer rights than they did.\n\nSign up for Molly's newsletter, Wait, What?, here.\n\nWe may have made a lot of mistakes, but at least we gave you Roe . I can't even count the number of times my mother said some version of this to me. It was her way of explaining an earlier generation's approach to feminism, and what she would say to me when she was trying to make sense of her own legacy. Maybe it wasn't a normal thing for a mother to say to a daughter, but my mother isn't a normal mother. She is Erica Jong, a second-wave feminist, a famous novelist, and a woman who throughout her career constantly grappled with what she and her cohort had accomplished and what they hadn't.\n\nThey hadn't managed to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. They had failed on fair pay. The too-long list of things that had once seemed possible would continue to sting for decades. During the Reagan and Bush eras, my mother felt complete despair at the way conservatism rebounded politically and culturally. She'd say she was a member of the whiplash generation, \"raised to be Doris Day, yearning in our 20s to be Gloria Steinem, then doomed to raise our midlife daughters in the age of Nancy Reagan and Princess Di,\" as she put it in her memoir, Fear of Fifty.\n\nKeep in mind that my mother, like some other second-wave feminists, had huge blind spots because she had grown up wealthy and white in a blue city in a blue state. Sometimes she'd get really drunk at dinner and grumble about all the things feminists couldn't get done for their daughters (meaning me), but she would always comfort herself with the reality that they had gotten one major thing right. My mother and all the women who fought alongside her gave my generation Roe v. Wade. They gave us the bodily autonomy we should have already had. They gave us the opportunity to choose what happens in our own uterus. It was an essential gift, and an irreversible one. Or so we thought.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nAmericans now see that we won't always have the rights Roe enshrines. Indeed-according to a draft Supreme Court opinion that leaked last night, originally published by Politico -we may not have Roe for very much longer at all.\n\nI always believed that the three justices appointed by Donald Trump would move to overturn Roe , but seeing it actually unfold, reading the words of the draft decision , provoked a generational kind of shock: \"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.\" Each line is like something out of my mother's generation's worst nightmare. Forty-nine years after the greatest feminist victory of the 20th century, Samuel Alito writes : \" Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\" It's worth pointing out here that in 1973, five years before I was born, when women had far fewer rights-when they couldn't even get a credit card without the permission of their husband or father- Roe was decided 7-2, with five Republican-appointed justices in support. The world has become profoundly more pro-choice than it was in 1973; even Catholic countries like Ireland have legalized abortion. Yet here in America, the clock is spinning backwards with stunning and terrifying speed.\n\nIt's not that my mother's generation hasn't feared this outcome before. Six days after the 1989 swearing-in of president George H. W. Bush, my mother wrote in The New York Times , \"Now that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear an attack on Roe v. Wade, it is painfully apparent that two decades of feminist achievement can be swept away with one wave of a judicial or Presidential hand. Women and men who thought all this was settled long ago, who naively assumed that women's bodies would never again be political battle grounds, have had to wake up and take notice.\" Sixteen years later, in October 2005, Bush's son would appoint the man who would write the draft opinion that proves how naive we have been.\n\nRachel Rebouché and Mary Ziegler: There's no knowing what will happen when Roe falls\n\n\"The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions,\" Alito writes . But that's not really true. Forty-nine years encompasses a lot of history and tradition. I am 43 years old. I have never lived in an America without Roe . I have never lived in a country where more than half of the population does not have agency over their own body. It appears that I will live in that world starting in June, and so will 167 million other women.\n\nSo what now? The internet is a sea of enraged comments. Online activism can be powerful-but it is not enough. A CNN poll from January shows that only about 30 percent of Americans want Roe overturned. The large majority of Americans don't want this. And now is the time for them to exercise a right we still have-the right to peacefully protest.\n\nThose who support Roe 's protections must show lawmakers and justices that they are about to do something very unpopular. Last night, peaceful protesters gathered in front of the Supreme Court to chant , \"Hey hey, ho ho, Sam Alito's got to go.\" By 11 p.m., hundreds of people had assembled. But hundreds of people can't do this alone. This leaked document should become a rallying cry. The opinion is still a draft. We don't know with certainty where all the justices will land. Democrats still control Congress, and the presidency. There are still things they could do. Congress can legislate; President Joe Biden can use his executive powers .\n\nMy mother is 80 now. She doesn't write much anymore. But the term whiplash generation feels more apt than ever. She is about to watch her granddaughter grow up in a world without the rights she secured for herself, and for her daughter. Today, we have a glimpse of history not yet written. A seismic change in America is coming, and it is coming quickly. But it isn't too late. Not yet.\n\nListen to the writers Molly Jong-Fast, Mary Ziegler, and David French on Radio Atlantic :"

      "text": "The End of Roe\n\nToday's oral argument signaled that the Court is poised to reverse Roe v. Wade outright.\n\nUpdated at 1:55 p.m. ET on December 2, 2021.\n\nAnyone listening to today's oral argument on abortion could not miss that something historic was happening. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , involves a Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks. Such a ban is clearly unconstitutional under current law- Roe v. Wade and its successor case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , recognize a right to choose abortion until fetal viability, which is at roughly 24 weeks . To uphold Mississippi's law, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have two options: They can ditch the viability line or get rid of Roe altogether.\n\nToday's oral argument signaled that the Court is poised to reverse Roe outright when it decides Dobbs , probably sometime in June or early July. That would be one of the most significant reversals of Supreme Court precedent in American history. Roe v. Wade has been the law for 50 years. Even Brett Kavanaugh spent much of his confirmation hearing proclaiming his fidelity to precedent . Today, the attorney for Jackson Women's Health Organization, the abortion provider challenging the Mississippi law, leaned hard on the idea that the Court must respect its own precedents-a strategic choice given that the Court's conservative majority was never going to be sympathetic to the idea of abortion rights.\n\nBut the six conservatives did not appear worried about precedent. Chief Justice John Roberts, known for his concern about the Court's institutional legitimacy , seemed to think that the Court could respect precedent while eliminating the viability line-a boundary that he argued has nothing to do with freedom of choice, which is what Roe protects. Roberts's suggestion of this compromise approach was not surprising-the Court would not have taken this case if it did not plan to get rid of viability.\n\nReynolds Holding: The judge who told the truth about the Mississippi abortion ban\n\nWhat was surprising was that no one but Roberts really seemed interested in the viability compromise.\n\nNeil Gorsuch, who seemed skeptical of the idea that a right to choose abortion exists, repeatedly asked questions suggesting that there is no middle-ground position-the justices should either leave Roe intact or eliminate abortion rights altogether. Samuel Alito took a more historical approach, hinting that there can be no right to abortion , because at the time the relevant part of the Constitution was written, many states had already made abortion a crime. Clarence Thomas suggested that neither the counsel for the abortion providers nor the counsel for the United States could define a right clearly rooted in the nation's history or tradition.\n\nKavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seemed to be on the same page. Barrett echoed Roberts's question about viability, but mostly she dwelled on Roe 's flaws. She returned more than once to the question of whether women rely on the availability of legal abortion to achieve equal citizenship. (The Court puts a lot of weight on whether people rely on a specific rule of law when deciding whether to overrule a precedent.) Those challenging Mississippi's law stressed that getting rid of Roe would have devastating consequences . Barrett was hardly convinced. She raised the example of so-called safe-haven laws, which allow people to surrender unwanted newborns with no legal penalty. An unwanted pregnancy need not burden anyone, she suggested, who could simply put up a child for adoption.\n\nDavid H. Gans: No, really, the right to an abortion is supported by the text and history of the Constitution\n\nKavanaugh's position was even clearer. He argued that the Court might be better off if it allowed the states to resolve the abortion issue themselves-if the Court restored what Kavanaugh described as neutrality, meaning that in his view the Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice and states get to decide. When the challengers raised concerns about the risks women would face if neutrality were restored, the indifference in the room was notable. Barrett conceded that reversing Roe would mean that people would have to face the burdens of pregnancy. Kavanaugh stated sympathetically that abortion is a hard issue.\n\nThe clearest big-picture development is that what passes for a compromise on abortion law has changed fundamentally. Roberts thought that the Court would go for superficially preserving Roe while allowing states to ban most (if not all) abortions, but that does not seem to be enough for this Court. Instead, we seem to be headed toward the idea of \"compromise\" that Kavanaugh hinted at: a Supreme Court that immediately reverses Roe now that its membership has changed, without qualification or apology. That, Kavanaugh suggests, will be the ultimate compromise: a neutral, apolitical Court. Good luck convincing anyone of that.\n\nThis article originally misidentified the name of the abortion provider challenging the Mississippi law."

      "text": "There's No Knowing What Will Happen When Roe Falls\n\nAt the state level, countless factors will converge to produce unpredictable results.\n\nEverything about the American abortion war has taken on an air of inevitability. The Supreme Court will reverse Roe v. Wade , the landmark abortion decision establishing a constitutional right to end a pregnancy . The United States will divide along expected lines, with abortion broadly accessible in blue states and all but entirely criminalized in red states.\n\nThis narrative is not completely wrong. Twelve states have passed so-called trigger bans that will outlaw all or most abortions if Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey are overturned . At the same time, 16 states and the District of Columbia have policies guaranteeing abortion rights no matter what the Supreme Court decides .\n\nBut states in the middle of this spectrum-which have not made their preferences as explicit-may well be more contested than people seem to assume. The resulting legal landscape will be complex , and, perhaps more important, those states' policies may evolve over time. The forces shaping a post- Roe America may prove surprising, encouraging some states that currently restrict abortion to reverse course.\n\nConsider the following factors. One might expect abortion-skeptical states, at least in the short term, to keep many of their restrictions on the books. Indeed, most states, even ones perceived as supportive of abortion, ban abortion past a certain point in pregnancy (24 weeks, for example), require parental permission for minors' abortions, or mandate that providers report certain information to the state, to name some of the more popular laws. But in the long term, if Roe falls, these states may face pressure to shift toward more abortion-friendly policies.\n\nKimberly Wehle: What Roe could take down with it\n\nFirst, polls consistently show that public opinion supports some level of abortion access, especially early in pregnancy, and opposes criminalizing doctors or women . Those numbers have been quite stable, yet even so, plenty of state legislatures have restricted abortion without political consequences. But if the Supreme Court clearly repudiates Roe , we may see a backlash that galvanizes people who haven't typically taken a side in the abortion debate, including many who accept restrictions on abortion but not outright bans. This is unlikely to happen across the country, but it could make a key difference in a handful of states. Hints of such political mobilization are already apparent in places such as Virginia, which has historically restricted abortion but now has repealed some of those regulations following public outcry .\n\nSecond, states likely to ban abortion are concentrated in the South and the Midwest, while abortion-friendly states, with some exceptions, cluster on the coasts. The effect of criminalization will be to further consolidate services in regions permitting abortion. That will make the services of any clinic outside those centers-in the middle of the country, for example-far more in demand. The financial considerations of abortion clinics have been an unpopular topic for abortion-rights advocates. But the provision of abortion services is more efficient at scale, and noncoastal clinics should be able to provide their services for less cost as they grow. A booming market for contraception, which reached $250 million by 1938 , helped create pressure from businesses on states to broaden access. If the market for abortion care shifts so that regional clinics become better resourced and politically powerful, states might begin to listen to those providers and the professional organizations that represent them.\n\nThird, laws that seek to punish abortion-which, at present, focus on providers and those who assist them-are going to become harder to enforce. One key reason is the emergence of telehealth for abortion. Last year , the federal government lifted a restriction on the first drug in a medication abortion-a two-drug regimen that ends a pregnancy before 10 weeks of gestation. Providers can now mail abortion pills to patients, and as a result, entirely virtual clinics, offering medication abortion through online telehealth services, have proliferated . Even in the states that ban remotely provided abortions, early terminations accomplished by pills that are mailed will be hard to trace and difficult to deter. The time, money, and infrastructure to effectively enforce those laws may not be worth the cost. In the long run, underenforcement could lead to repeal or modification of those policies.\n\nJessica Bruder: A covert network of activists is preparing for the end of Roe\n\nBut other factors put pressure in the opposite direction, potentially pushing even middle-ground states toward more restrictive policies. True, polls suggest that Americans do not want abortion to be criminalized, especially early in pregnancy, but the nation is politically fragmented, and abortion bans may be relatively popular in some states. Even in more contested states, many politicians may be able to protect themselves from the consequences of unpopular policies, thanks to gerrymandering, uncompetitive seats, and limits on voting. Republicans may be worried that committed anti-abortion voters will be less likely to donate to or turn out for swing-state politicians who don't meet their demands. Florida and Georgia , for instance, are large, diverse, politically contested states where the state legislatures tend to pass laws on issues designed to energize the base, regardless of what the wider public thinks. This dynamic might only deepen after Roe is gone, particularly if abortion aligns with other hot-button topics in the country's culture war.\n\nFurthermore, even if polls suggest that most Americans don't want Roe overturned, no one yet knows how Americans will react to its demise. Many polls that ostensibly focus on Roe in fact ask questions that cover a range of reproductive-rights issues, some of which have little to do with Roe at all. Public reaction will depend on what the Supreme Court says, how the media present the Court's decision, and how successfully social movements can spin the results.\n\nIf enforcing abortion bans is hard, that might encourage abortion-skeptical states to keep their abortion restrictions, not the other way around. Before the Supreme Court decided Roe , abortion prosecutions were the exception, not the rule, typically occurring when provider negligence led to a patient's death. States periodically cracked down, but many were content to have a law on the books condemning abortion without doing much to enforce it. The same bargain might appeal to some states after Roe is gone: access to black-market abortion, underenforced criminal bans, a symbolic statement about the evils of abortion, and the option to ratchet up enforcement on providers when conservative voters demand it.\n\nStates may even seek to avoid political consequences by prioritizing whom to punish. In other countries where abortion is a crime, such as Ecuador , prosecutors disproportionately target not just doctors but also low-income patients, and especially people of color. Selective enforcement can blunt backlash to a criminal law-this seems to have been the case with the criminalization of marijuana and the prohibition of alcohol in the U.S. Though people of different races were roughly equally likely to violate those laws, people of color were far more likely to be arrested or prosecuted. Taking aim at marginalized communities may allow states to escape pressure from more privileged Americans, who will feel that the law won't personally affect them.\n\nSo how many states will gravitate toward criminalization, proactive protection of abortion rights, or something in between? Nothing is predetermined, and each state will be different, responding to the particular politics and pressures of their populations. Both movements will find that one-size-fits-all strategies won't work; they'll have to become masters of the specifics of each state. Without Roe , this will be a state-by-state fight, and they'll have to find strategies that speak less to the nation and more to the politics of place."

      "text": "The Justices Are Telling Us What They Think About Roe v. Wade\n\nA majority on the Supreme Court appears ready to strike down the landmark decision-but they're not prepared for the ensuing havoc.\n\nThe five justices who upheld Texas's anti-abortion law in the middle of the night this week insisted that their hands were tied: Texas had invoked sovereign immunity , and abortion providers had not proved that the state was wrong. Above all, the majority warned people not to overreact. Women in Texas might not be able to get an abortion anymore, and abortion providers might have already shut down, but worry not. The Supreme Court had not drawn \"any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas's law.\"\n\nFor anyone paying attention, the upshot of this was clear. For starters, Texas lawmakers had not kept their intentions secret: They wanted to ban almost all abortions and skirt the consequences . The law raised \"complex and novel\" \"procedural questions,\" according to the Court majority, but only because the law's designers had homed in on a creative strategy for achieving their goals.\n\nThat the Court pretended this wasn't about the fate of abortion rights tells us that the justices may be ready to strike down Roe v. Wade- but are less prepared for the havoc such a decision would wreak. Reversing Roe would not be a mere part of the legacy of John Roberts's Court and the justices sitting on it-it would define that legacy.\n\nAdam Serwer: Five Justices did this because they could\n\nAnd it could have enormous institutional and political consequences: Court reform-which remains a matter of abstract inquiry rather than an earnest legislative push-would be more seriously on the table. Pro-abortion-rights voters in 2022 and 2024 could make their discontent known at the polls .\n\nThe justices who allowed Texas's law to go into effect hardly seem to love the thought of that backlash. Their order tried to reassure the public by spelling out what was not being decided-and tried to signal that the Court takes all of this very seriously. And even before this particular question arose, during their confirmation hearings, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett repeated that when it came to Roe , they would keep an open mind. After all, they are neutral arbiters of the law, not pre-committed ideologues.\n\nThe justices desperately want the public to believe that is true, even though similar procedural hurdles did not stop the Court from blocking COVID-19 stay-at-home orders that affected in-person worship , and even though the Court's overnight order made a laughingstock of what is still supposedly a constitutional right. The message was clear: Texas wanted to pass a legal-consequence-free abortion ban, and the Supreme Court wanted to find a political-consequence-free way to uphold one.\n\nTransparency has never been a hallmark of the Court's abortion jurisprudence. In 1992, when the Court declined an invitation to reverse Roe , the justices held that states could not unduly burden women seeking abortions . What an undue burden meant was rarely clear to anyone-and often depended on which judge was considering a law. In the years since, the Court has changed the value attached to fetal life-describing the dignity of unborn children-without clearly explaining how this shift has affected abortion jurisprudence .\n\nAnti-abortion leaders blame this opacity on Roe , which they argue is a hopelessly muddled, unworkable decision . The real explanation is present in yesterday's decision: The Supreme Court may want to reverse Roe , but it is afraid of what will happen when the decision is gone. This fear makes it attractive to hem and haw, to deny and obfuscate. Clarence Thomas may not miss a chance to denounce Roe , but his colleagues are less keen to do so.\n\nLaura Bassett: All of those 'hysterical' women were right\n\nThe justices will be disappointed to learn that they are not fooling anyone. People in Texas have a clear idea of what is going on-abortion clinics are already refusing to perform most abortions, and people seeking to help loved ones find a doctor out of state or order pills on the internet will wonder if they will face a lawsuit. Red-state lawmakers have heard the message loud and clear. They will pass laws like Texas's unless they don't see the need to bother. And that might already be the case: There is little reason to do an end run around Roe if the Court seems ready to reverse it.\n\nThe justices may have issued their order in the dead of night, but they cannot hide from this decision . The Court owes the nation a clear explanation about what is happening to abortion rights and why. But if this decision is any indication, the country is unlikely to get one.\n\nThis story is part of the project \" The Battle for the Constitution ,\" in partnership with the National Constitution Center ."

      "text": "Roe Was Never Roe After All\n\nThe landmark decision never gave women the rights that people wanted to believe it did.\n\nTomorrow will mark 50 years since Roe v. Wade was decided, but the landmark ruling did not make it to its semicentennial, having been overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization last summer. Many people viewed this as the end of abortion rights in America. But that's not what it was. Both practically and theoretically, Roe was never the guarantor of those rights that people believed it to be.\n\nThe \" Roe \" that has occupied the center of the abortion debate for decades bears only a passing resemblance to anything the Supreme Court said in 1973. Roe has become much more than a legal text; it's a cultural symbol created not only by judges but by voters, politicians, and grassroots movements. And the history of America's fixation on Roe is a story not just about the power of the Supreme Court, but about how the Court alone does not-and should not-dictate what the Constitution says.\n\nMary Ziegler: If the Supreme Court can reverse Roe , it can reverse anything\n\nIn 1973, a Supreme Court stacked with Republican nominees handed down a 7-2 decision holding that the constitutional right to privacy was broad enough to protect an abortion choice made by a \" woman and her responsible physician .\" The text of Roe would be deeply foreign to almost anyone who reads it today. Justice Harry Blackmun's majority opinion spoke mostly about the prerogatives of doctors, not women, and breezily dismissed the idea that \"one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases .\" Ultimately, the Court's ruling did not so much embrace a sweeping notion of women's rights as it made regulating abortion harder, at least during the first trimester.\n\nFrom the beginning, many people celebrated Roe as a feminist triumph, especially for women of color, who generally suffered most when abortion was a crime . But life under Roe was in some ways disappointing for those who believed in abortion rights-or, in many cases, for those who sought an abortion. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment , which banned Medicaid reimbursement for abortion, and in 1980, the Supreme Court upheld it . Already, less than a decade after the Court's decision, the right to choose abortion was functionally out of reach for some of the nation's poorest women .\n\nThe gap between the fantasy and the reality of Roe grew wider after 1992, when the Supreme Court functionally overruled key parts of its 1973 decision and made a new precedent, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , the law of the land. Under Casey , states could regulate abortion as long as a law did not have the purpose or effect of creating a substantial obstacle for those seeking abortion-a standard that seemed relatively easy to satisfy (the Court struck down only one of the many restrictions before it in Casey ). After Casey , states passed an ever-growing number of restrictions, some of which the Court upheld. And yet even after the Court had wiped part of Roe away, Americans kept believing that Roe ruled everything, and they kept arguing over it-promising to undo its legacy or codify it .\n\nGrassroots movements developed new ideas about what Roe ought to stand for. The leader of one reproductive-justice group formed by women of color argued that Roe had \"never fully protected Black women- or poor women .\" Anti-abortion activists made Roe a symbol of \" judicial activism \" and jump-started conversations about the legitimacy of the federal courts. Roe may have been on the books, but it never settled debates about abortion-or even its own meaning-in any significant way.\n\nJerusalem Demsas: The fate of states' rights after Roe\n\nThe Dobbs decision echoed common anti-abortion-rights talking points about Roe being an undemocratic decision, and even repeated the argument that Roe resembled Plessy v. Ferguson , the notorious case that upheld racial segregation. In the Court's opinion, Justice Samuel Alito also seemed interested in ending constitutional conversations about abortion once and for all, rejecting not only the arguments raised in Roe and Casey but also a rationale for abortion rights based on sex equality that was neither briefed by the petitioner or respondent nor a part of either Roe or Casey .\n\nSince Dobbs came down, constitutional conflicts about abortion have only multiplied. Abortion-rights supporters have pursued what reporters call \" mini Roe s \" in state supreme courts, asking for the recognition of state constitutional rights. Six ballot initiatives have put the question directly to voters , and many more will likely follow . State lawmakers will have their say on what reproductive rights ought to mean-and whether it's constitutional to apply one state's laws to what happens in another, or to criminalize information about abortion. Maybe (though it's unlikely) Congress will pass a federal bill recognizing either an abortion right or fetal protections. All of these efforts make explicit something that had been clear to anyone looking closely enough while Roe was good law: Americans' rights don't come just from the Supreme Court. Even when the Court intervenes, it often-as in Dobbs -responds to political pressures and decades of fighting between grassroots groups and political parties. And sometimes our rights have nothing to do with the federal courts-they are also the result of state or federal legislation, state constitutional rulings, and ballot-initiative decisions passed by ordinary voters.\n\nRoe 's legacy is complex, and its aftereffects-on partisan politics, on fights about the separation of powers, and on battles about gender-will be felt for years to come. Those who support abortion rights may experience this anniversary as a loss. But they should look to history for the lesson Samuel Alito, the author of Dobbs , will soon learn-the lesson that Harry Blackmun had to learn years ago: The Court does not get the final word, even on the meaning of its own most important decisions.\n\n*Lead image: Illustration by Joanne Imperio.

But Wade, who became the Heat's all-time leading scorer during 14 seasons with Miami, didn't seem to mind whether the statue resembled him. His first thought when he saw the statue was, \"That's beautiful,\" he told reporters gathered at the unveiling. \"I think it's one of the best statues that's been created because of what is represents for us and for me.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "It's Official: The Supreme Court Has Overturned Roe v. Wade\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nNearly half a century after the Supreme Court ruled that the ability to end a pregnancy was a constitutional right, the nation's highest court has overturned Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled that the 1973 decision was wrong in its determination that an implied right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution protected a patient's decision to have an abortion.\n\n\"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled,\" Alito wrote for the 6-3 majority. \"The authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision effectively ends abortion access for roughly 40 million women and girls in nearly two dozen states across the country. Thirteen of those states have pre-emptively enacted \"trigger laws\" intended to impose severe restrictions on the procedure in the event of a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe . Others have pre- Roe bans that remain on the books or have passed subsequent laws that have been blocked by federal courts.\n\nMost of the laws, many of which take immediate effect , make exceptions only in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if an abortion is necessary to save a patient's life.\n\nThe ruling is the culmination of five decades of legal, political, and social action by abortion opponents, whose previous efforts to impose limitations on the procedure were stymied by Supreme Court precedent. A similar case brought before the court in 1992, Casey v. Planned Parenthood , reaffirmed the protections provided in Roe .\n\nBut a shift in the Supreme Court's composition during the Trump administration gave hope to abortion opponents that justices could rule to overturn Roe .\n\nAlito was joined in the opinion by Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh , and Clarence Thomas, all of whom were nominated to the court by Republican presidents. Chief Justice John Roberts concurred with the judgment in a separate opinion.\n\nAs the decision came down, anti-abortion groups began yelling in excitement. Champagne was popped and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) could be seen in the crowd celebrating. \"Did I hear that correctly?\" Marina Mason, a staffer with Students for Life, asked The Daily Beast in front of the court. \"I'm so happy... it's amazing.\"\n\n\"I'm thrilled. I'm overjoyed,\" Greene told The Daily Beast while being mobbed by hecklers yelling, \"My body, my choice!\"\n\nAn emotional President Joe Biden called it \"the realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , began winding its way through the federal court system four years ago when Mississippi's sole abortion clinic sought to overturn a 2018 law that banned abortions performed after 15 weeks of gestation. Lower courts, in keeping with precedent, successively determined that the law violated Roe 's abortion protections.\n\nThe landmark decision in Dobbs comes seven weeks after a draft of the majority opinion was leaked to Politico . That draft, confirmed to be authentic by Roberts shortly after its release in early May, follows nearly verbatim the final ruling issued on Friday.\n\nThe majority likened the overturning of Roe , considered a \"superprecedent\" in some legal circles, to some of the Supreme Court's \"most important decisions\" reversing previous rulings, including the overturning of Plessy v. Ferguson , which found racial segregation to be constitutional, with Brown v. Board of Education .\n\n\"Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided,\" the majority wrote. \"Those on the losing side-those who sought to advance the State's interest in fetal life-could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe .\"\n\nIn their dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan declared that the majority's ruling \"says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\"\n\n\"With sorrow-for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection-we dissent,\" the minority wrote. \"As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare.\"\n\nWriting in a separate concurrence , Thomas declared that with Roe overturned, the Supreme Court should now \"reconsider\" a host of other major cases predicated on the 14th Amendment's implication of a right to privacy, including recent rulings that protected the right to contraception and same-sex marriage.\n\n\"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell ,\" Thomas wrote, referring to Supreme Court rulings that legalized contraception access, sex between two people of the same gender, and same-sex marriage. \"We have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nThe real-world consequences of the ruling began almost immediately. In Missouri, Attorney General Eric Schmitt waited less than half an hour to sign an opinion determining that with Roe 's overturning, a 2019 trigger law banning nearly all abortions in the state now goes into effect.\n\n\"Missouri has just become the first in the country to effectively end abortion,\" Schmitt said in a statement announcing the opinion. \"This is a monumental day for the sanctity of life.\"\n\nPublication of the draft opinion sparked a national uproar over what appeared to be Roe 's imminent demise, although supporters of abortion rights gained little ground in the weeks before the final decision was released. Congressional Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation that would have codified abortion access into federal law, and President Joe Biden was deeply criticized by abortion-rights leaders for his perceived reticence to address the issue on its face.\n\n\"After the 2020 election, they went on and on and on about how 'Black women saved the Senate, Black women saved democracy.' Black women were asking you to make sure that we have access to health care,\" Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, an organization that represents those who have had abortions, told The Daily Beast tearfully before the final decision was released. \"Where were you?\"\n\nDiane Derzis, the owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the subject of today's new landmark case, spoke to The Daily Beast earlier in the week and said she feared the worst with the court's decision.\n\n\"They still think they can control women. How many women are going to be forced to have children they do not want and can't afford? I think those are the women that we are going to be responsive to at that point,\" Derzis said. \"We have other clinics opening across the country, but what is going to happen in Jackson? What's going to happen to our patients there? This is possibly the worst thing that would have happened to women.\"\n\nOther advocates struck a resilient tone. In a statement, National Women's Law Center President Fatima Goss Graves said the decision was just the beginning of extremist attacks on American's fundamental rights and added, \"They will not win-we will not let them.\" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, called the decision \"devastating,\" but added that, \"in stripping away our rights, the Supreme Court and anti-abortion politicians have also unleashed a movement.\"\n\nDemocrats filing into the House chamber appeared visibly shaken up-with several steadfastly bypassing reporters to go vote, though there was still plenty of time before it was gaveled closed.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) walking through simply said, \"Not yet. Not ready yet.\"\n\nYet Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) issued a stark warning to reporters, \"This will not go quietly.\" She vowed to restore abortion rights for her granddaughter and said she anticipated her constituents will protest \"peacefully.\"\n\nOutside, standing barely 50 feet away from the anti-abortion rights revelers, demonstrators with the group Rise Up for Abortion Rights yelled \"Channel your anger!\" as the crowd in front of the court continued to grow.\n\nShortly after their vote to advance the rule for the bipartisan gun deal moving through the chamber Friday, dozens of House Democrats gathered at the bottom of the Capitol steps to march to the Supreme Court. Several members held signs and many of the congresswomen walked with their arms locked, chanting, \"We won't go back. We trust women.\"\n\nAs they approached the court, protesters on both sides of the issue shouted at members. Anti-abortion protesters shouted a chant heard at many of their recent protests at the court: \"Pro-choice is a lie, babies never choose to die.\"\n\nAs members approached the abortion-rights side, protesters by and large shouted thanks to the Democrats for showing up.\n\nSen. Tina Smith (D-MN), a former Planned Parenthood executive, said she wasn't surprised to see the decision-nonetheless \"it was stunning to see this Supreme Court speak, and realize that Roe is gone.\"\n\n\"Having seen firsthand the capacity of women to make good decisions for themselves about their own health care... to see this come to fulfillment was stunning,\" Smith said. \"You can hear the anger in my voice, the sense of outrage that they think they know better than people whose lives and stories they're never going to know.\"\n\nSmith said the court now consists of \"six Republican activists in black robes\" and called the Dobbs decision \"why we need to look at reforming the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I strongly push back on the idea this is somehow the fault of Democrats, when Republicans are the ones who have put these radical justices on the court-they are the ones who are accountable and responsible for stripping away this freedom that has been in place.\"\n\nAsked to respond to Sen. Joe Manchin's statement saying he was \"alarmed\" that Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch had testified in confirmation hearings that Roe was settled law, she said, \"I was in the Senate when Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh ascended to the Supreme Court. I never had any question about where they stood on the question of abortion, because the president who put them on the Supreme Court... his intention was to name anti-choice justices to the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I never had any doubt that these justices were going to take the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade . That's exactly what has happened.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

In Missouri, Attorney General Eric Schmitt waited less than half an hour to sign an opinion determining that with Roe 's overturning, a 2019 trigger law banning nearly all abortions in the state now goes into effect.\n\n\"Missouri has just become the first in the country to effectively end abortion,\" Schmitt said in a statement announcing the opinion. \"This is a monumental day for the sanctity of life.\"\n\nPublication of the draft opinion sparked a national uproar over what appeared to be Roe 's imminent demise, although supporters of abortion rights gained little ground in the weeks before the final decision was released. Congressional Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation that would have codified abortion access into federal law, and President Joe Biden was deeply criticized by abortion-rights leaders for his perceived reticence to address the issue on its face.\n\n\"After the 2020 election, they went on and on and on about how 'Black women saved the Senate, Black women saved democracy.' Black women were asking you to make sure that we have access to health care,\" Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, an organization that represents those who have had abortions, told The Daily Beast tearfully before the final decision was released. \"Where were you?\"\n\nDiane Derzis, the owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the subject of today's new landmark case, spoke to The Daily Beast earlier in the week and said she feared the worst with the court's decision.\n\n\"They still think they can control women. How many women are going to be forced to have children they do not want and can't afford? I think those are the women that we are going to be responsive to at that point,\" Derzis said. \"We have other clinics opening across the country, but what is going to happen in Jackson? What's going to happen to our patients there? This is possibly the worst thing that would have happened to women.\"\n\nOther advocates struck a resilient tone. In a statement, National Women's Law Center President Fatima Goss Graves said the decision was just the beginning of extremist attacks on American's fundamental rights and added, \"They will not win-we will not let them.\" Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood, called the decision \"devastating,\" but added that, \"in stripping away our rights, the Supreme Court and anti-abortion politicians have also unleashed a movement.\"\n\nDemocrats filing into the House chamber appeared visibly shaken up-with several steadfastly bypassing reporters to go vote, though there was still plenty of time before it was gaveled closed.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) walking through simply said, \"Not yet. Not ready yet.\"\n\nYet Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) issued a stark warning to reporters, \"This will not go quietly.\" She vowed to restore abortion rights for her granddaughter and said she anticipated her constituents will protest \"peacefully.\"\n\nOutside, standing barely 50 feet away from the anti-abortion rights revelers, demonstrators with the group Rise Up for Abortion Rights yelled \"Channel your anger!\" as the crowd in front of the court continued to grow.\n\nShortly after their vote to advance the rule for the bipartisan gun deal moving through the chamber Friday, dozens of House Democrats gathered at the bottom of the Capitol steps to march to the Supreme Court. Several members held signs and many of the congresswomen walked with their arms locked, chanting, \"We won't go back. We trust women.\"\n\nAs they approached the court, protesters on both sides of the issue shouted at members. Anti-abortion protesters shouted a chant heard at many of their recent protests at the court: \"Pro-choice is a lie, babies never choose to die.\"\n\nAs members approached the abortion-rights side, protesters by and large shouted thanks to the Democrats for showing up.\n\nSen. Tina Smith (D-MN), a former Planned Parenthood executive, said she wasn't surprised to see the decision-nonetheless \"it was stunning to see this Supreme Court speak, and realize that Roe is gone.\"\n\n\"Having seen firsthand the capacity of women to make good decisions for themselves about their own health care... to see this come to fulfillment was stunning,\" Smith said. \"You can hear the anger in my voice, the sense of outrage that they think they know better than people whose lives and stories they're never going to know.\"\n\nSmith said the court now consists of \"six Republican activists in black robes\" and called the Dobbs decision \"why we need to look at reforming the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I strongly push back on the idea this is somehow the fault of Democrats, when Republicans are the ones who have put these radical justices on the court-they are the ones who are accountable and responsible for stripping away this freedom that has been in place.\"\n\nAsked to respond to Sen. Joe Manchin's statement saying he was \"alarmed\" that Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch had testified in confirmation hearings that Roe was settled law, she said, \"I was in the Senate when Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh ascended to the Supreme Court. I never had any question about where they stood on the question of abortion, because the president who put them on the Supreme Court... his intention was to name anti-choice justices to the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\"I never had any doubt that these justices were going to take the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade . That's exactly what has happened.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How dismantling Roe v Wade could imperil other 'core, basic human rights'\n\nSupreme court appears inclined to severely curtail or overturn Roe v Wade after hearing Mississippi case, which could affect gay rights, contraceptives and fertility treatments\n\nC onstitutional scholars in the US said a litany of rights, from same-sex marriage and sex to birth control and in vitro fertilization, could come into question if the country's highest court moves to overrule or weaken Roe v Wade .\n\nThe supreme court last week heard arguments in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, which centers on whether the state of Mississippi can ban abortion at 15 weeks gestation, roughly nine weeks before bans are permitted under current law.\n\nThe Mississippi case is widely regarded as the most important abortion rights case since Roe v Wade, when the supreme court effectively legalized abortion nationally in 1973. A decision in the Dobbs case is expected June 2022.\n\nAlthough supreme court opinions are notoriously difficult to predict, a majority of justices on the conservative-leaning court appeared inclined to severely curtail or overturn Roe v Wade , which protects abortion rights in states hostile to the procedure.\n\nLegal scholars warned that the impacts of such a move would likely be widespread, because abortion rights are rooted in the same implied constitutional right to privacy that is the foundation for other intimate personal decisions Americans now take for granted.\n\nGay rights, contraceptives, certain fertility treatments and even interracial marriage, \"are imperiled because they're all rooted in that right to privacy\", Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University law school and an expert in constitutional, family and reproductive rights law, told the Guardian.\n\n\"All of this has been implied because they're understood to be core, basic human rights,\" said Murray. \"You don't need the state to recognize them because they are vested in you by virtue of being a human.\"\n\nCurrently, states are prevented from banning abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb, a concept known as \"viability\". But at the hearing on 1 December, a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold Mississippi's law, which would require either invalidating the \"viability\" standard or overturn Roe v Wade entirely.\n\nIn arguments, justices pointed to several ways they may reinterpret the Roe v Wade decision. Some, such as Justice Clarence Thomas, were skeptical there is a right to privacy and were swayed by the lack of an explicit reference to the right in the constitution, a concept known as \"textualism\".\n\n\"If we were talking about the second amendment, I know exactly what we're talking about,\" said Thomas. \"If we're talking about the fourth amendment, I know what we're talking about because it's written. It's there.\"\n\nThat argument could be paired with one pushed forward by conservatives, such as Mississippi solicitor general Scott Stewart, who argued a right to abortion is not grounded in the \"history or tradition\" of the country.\n\n\"A right to abortion [is] not grounded in the text,\" said Stewart. \"It's grounded on abstract concepts that this court has rejected in other contexts as supplying a substantive right\".\n\nThe theory underlying that right to privacy is called \"substantive due process\", or the doctrine that the constitution protects both the procedures of due process, such as how criminal law is applied, and \"substantive\" guarantees of life, liberty and property.\n\n\"If you ask where rights come from in the US constitution there's basically two general answers,\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and a historian who has studied abortion rights since Roe v Wade. \"There's the rights spelled out in the text of the constitution,\" such as rights to bear arms or against unreasonable search and seizure, \"and there's other rights, like the right to marry and the right to parent that are not in the text of the constitution\".\n\nThose are rights established by substantive due process. For example, in 1965 the court struck down birth control bans for married couples in Griswold v Connecticut . In 1967 with Loving v Virginia , the court invalidated anti-miscegenation laws that barred interracial marriage. In 1972 in Eisenstadt v Baird , the court found people who were not married also had a right to birth control. In 1973 , the court recognized a right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\n\"These rights of parental autonomy are underpinnings of the right to privacy; marriage is included in this,\" said Murray. \"In a later case, the state says marriage [and] procreation are basic civil rights of man.\"\n\nCases based in substantive due process continued into the modern era, when in 2003 the court invalidated anti-sodomy statutes in Lawrence v Texas and established a right to same-sex conduct. In 2016, the court found same-sex couples also had a right to marry in Obergefell v Hodges .\n\nAttorneys for Jackson Women's Health Organization responded on the principle of substantive due process when quizzed on this principle by Thomas.\n\n\"If I were to ask you what constitutional right protects the right to abortion, is it privacy? Is it autonomy? What would it be?\" asked Thomas.\n\n\"It's liberty, Your Honor,\" said Julie Rikelman, litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the abortion clinic.\n\nBriefs to the court in Dobbs directly challenge that principle, such as the brief from the conservative, anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life . Attorneys for the group, the conservative legal activists Adam Mortara and Jonathan Mitchell, argued the court does not necessarily need to overturn decisions protecting gay rights.\n\n\"But neither should the court hesitate to write an opinion that leaves those decisions hanging by a thread,\" wrote Mortara and Mitchell. \"Lawrence and Obergefell, while far less hazardous to human life, are as lawless as Roe.\" The same brief argued women could control their reproduction by refraining from sex . Neither Mitchell nor Mortara responded to an interview request.\n\nUntil the supreme court issues a decision, it is unclear exactly how rights protected by substantive due process might be affected. However, scholars consider same-sex and reproductive rights to be the most vulnerable because there is an active political campaign to circumscribe them. By contrast, there is little contemporary criticism of interracial marriage.\n\nIf Roe v Wade is overruled, \"it will be on the ground it was a right that was untethered from constitutional text,\" said Murray. If that view prevails on the court, rights to contraception, gay rights and in vitro fertilization could also be quickly implicated, since \"all of these things are untethered from constitutional text and historically were not available in the US\".\n\nWhat's more, the history of abortion rights may provide a roadmap for other rights to be hobbled, even if substantive due process prevails.\n\nMurray offered the example of a 2017 case, in which three conservative justices, led by justice Neil Gorsuch , argued states could restrict birth certificates of same-sex parents. Gorsuch argued there appeared to be nothing unconstitutional about a \"biology-based birth registration regime\" where only one same-sex parent would be listed on the certificate.\n\n\"It is a really good example of how they have dismantled Roe piecemeal and incrementally could be applied to these other rights,\" said Murray."

      "text": "Nick Wade obituary\n\nMy younger brother Nick Wade, who has died suddenly at the age of 50, was a talented professional 2D Flash animator. He worked on many cartoon programmes, bringing joy to millions of young children - and their parents.\n\nNick displayed artistic talent from an early age. He was full of energy and mischief, but also had a meticulous, exacting nature - a quality that paid off in the animation industry. He was sensitive and expressive, and in his own way was a performer, which was evidenced by his different styles and looks, ranging from mohicans, to Dalí-style moustaches, to quiffs. He once even crafted his hair into a spike at the front of his head, using metal glue. Nick described himself as a \"dancer who doesn't dance\", which to him was what it was to be an animator.\n\nNick was born in the city of 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, where his parents Jim Wade, a computer software engineer, and Sylvia (nee Kenning), a language teacher, were living. The family then moved to England, Switzerland, back to England and then, when our parents relocated to France, he boarded at Leighton Park school, Reading.\n\nHe went on to train with the London Animation Studio at Central Saint Martins, where he gained a distinction in traditional character animation in 2003. He lived in London with his wife Harumi Tanaka, an artist, whom he married in 1999, and their son, Victor.\n\nHe worked for years as a lead animator at various studios, including Astley Baker Davies, Karrot Animation, Chase Imagination and also on his own projects.\n\nNick worked on Bafta-winning productions such as the See Something, Say Something TV campaign (2008) for Nickelodeon; Quiff and Boot (2010) for BBC Learning; Peppa Pig (series four, 2011); and The Donkey Tooth Fairy (2011) and The Cyclops Whose Eye Fell Out (2012) for CITV. He also worked on The Secret Show, Sarah and Duck, Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom, Pedro and Frankensheep, Monkey Dust and Simon's Cat for various channels.\n\nMusic was always very important to him; he loved psychobilly, old rock'n'roll, ska, punk and other musical genres. Many of his friends have some of his artistic creations, including logos, caricatures, album covers, music videos, illustrations and his eclectic music mixes. I still treasure the chair he painted beautifully - to look as if it belongs in a wild garden - for my 30th birthday.\n\nHe is survived by Harumi, Victor, me, our half-sisters, Hattie and Tilly, and his father, Jim."

      "text": "A year ago Roe v Wade was overturned. Grieve for the new America\n\nThe supreme court's decision has created a two-tiered class of US citizenship: one for men and one for women. It is a generational tragedy\n\nT hat it has only been a year since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and ended the federal right to an abortion feels absurd, almost impossible. How horribly and dramatically our country has changed since then. In a span of just 12 months, thousands of lives have been permanently changed - dreams dashed, intentions scuttled, childhoods abruptly ended, talents and potential suppressed, health risked, and the self-determination of pregnant women snatched from them by a body of unelected jurists who believe that their own sentiments are more important than those women's dignity.\n\nThe decision unleashed atrocities and morbid perversions of medical ethics that have rapidly become routine. Women experiencing miscarriages now wait around in emergency rooms and parking lots, unable to receive treatment until they sicken to the point where sufficiently brutal health outcomes (life-ending or life-altering, depending on the state) become a certainty. Other women, and no small number of girls, now gestate and give birth to infants conceived by their rapists - their coaches, abusive boyfriends, acquaintances, priests, fathers. Still others are forced into torturously monstrous exercises in medical futility, their bodies commandeered and used by the state to birth babies without lungs or heads.\n\nAny one of these scenarios is the stuff of a horror movie, episodes of legally mandated medical sadism that makes a mockery of the principles of liberty, equality, privacy or due process. But the anti-choice movement also seems to be determined to bring an end to free speech: when an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, spoke to the media about performing an abortion on a raped 10-year-old girl who had had to flee Ohio for the procedure, Indiana state Republicans set about a year-long campaign of harassment and intimidation meant to punish her for speaking publicly about the reality that their policies had created.\n\nAll of this was predictable. All of it was, in fact, predicted by the pro-choice movement, whose size, institutional knowledge and internal variance did not earn it respect from either the Democratic establishment or the movement left. And it was all predicted, too, by the anti-choice movement, one of the largest and best-funded hate campaigns in the nation's history, whose habitual bad faith and single-minded commitment to ensuring women's suffering ushered in the human rights catastrophe of the post-Dobbs era entirely on purpose.\n\nThe Dobbs decision itself was not a surprise. Republicans held a commanding six-three supermajority on the court, ever since the appointment of the arch-conservative and devout Catholic justice Amy Coney Barrett, and the plaintiffs in Dobbs, the case that provided the court the excuse to end Roe, had revised their filings to ask for a more extreme ruling as soon as she was confirmed. Activists in the anti-choice movement, and the Republicans who do their bidding, dispensed with pretense and began introducing the bills they really wanted. Laws that criminalized women for seeking abortions were introduced; laws eliminating the fig-leaf \"rape, incest and life of the mother\" exemptions that the anti-choice set had long hid behind passed, and are now standard.\n\nNone of the ensuing atrocities should have come as a surprise to anyone with an interest in women's rights, because they were not a surprise: they were the anti-choice movement's design. Even the opinion itself leaked ahead of time, with a draft of Samuel Alito's rambling, contemptuous and ahistorical opinion published in Politico a month before the formal ruling.\n\nStill, the Biden administration was inexplicably and unforgivably flat-footed in the response, seemingly caught off-guard by an outcome that they had been warned about more than a month in advance. Members of the administration seemed, if anything, a bit irritated by the demand for action, and it emerged just days after the Dobbs decision went into effect that the Biden administration was in fact planning to appoint Chad Meredith , an anti-choice lawyer, to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench. The nomination was only dropped after an outcry from an irate nation.\n\nFor months, it seemed a victory when the clearly indifferent Biden so much as said the word abortion. When the decision came down, the Biden administration had no interest in using executive power to help women exercise their rights, and no plan to restore access, to redignify American women, or to mitigate the unspeakable harm that was coming. They still don't.\n\nFor months, abortion flickered in and out of legality in many states, like a fluorescent light with a moth caught in it, as lawsuits ascended through the courts and judicial stays either permitted or prohibited women from exercising authority over their own lives. But in the 13 states with so-called trigger laws - enacted by anti-choice Republicans in drooling anticipation of the day the court overturned Roe - the Dobbs decision meant that abortion was banned immediately. In these states, abortion providers rushed to perform as many procedures as they could before the bans went into effect, while women wept on the phone lines and in the waiting rooms, like passengers awaiting the last plane out of a war-torn country.\n\nThis was the stuff of another horror movie: the dwindling hours, the ticking minutes, that separated these women from a world where they were full citizens, endowed with the dignity to determine their own family futures and sexual lives, and one where they were transformed in law into something else, something lesser. Now, a new and chaotic legal regime has emerged, where women are full citizens in some states, something more like children in others. It is not a situation that will hold. The anti-abortion movement, and the Republicans who serve it, has every intention of pursuing a national ban, and all the resources needed to achieve it in our lifetimes.\n\nAmid all the brutality, all the horrific medical emergencies, all the women sickening to the brink of death, all the girls forced to remain pregnant with the children of their rapists while still children themselves, there is one central feature of Dobbs and its aftermath that hangs over every crude discussion of gestational limits and unspeakably vulgar argument over rape exemptions, this is the elephant in the room: that history does move backwards, that America does not advance all of its peoples steadily toward inclusion and justice, and that Dobbs diminished the citizenship of half of America because of their sex. It came as women attained new heights of education and achievement - it aims to reverse them. It came as trans people achieved new levels of visibility and acceptance as their true selves - it aimed to shove them back into a social role determined by their sex assigned at birth.\n\nDobbs created a two-tiered class of American citizenship: one for those who are trusted to plan their families and control their bodies, because they are male, and one for those who are not, because they are female. It is a generational tragedy.\n\nThis is not the kind of thing we are accustomed to memorializing in America: the lost dreams, the ruined health, the unwritten novels and symphonies, the early deaths, the searing and profound humiliation. We do not like to dwell on our failures, our violences, our ignoble reversals. But it is worth dwelling on this one today. Take a moment to remember the women who have been denied abortions since Dobbs - those who are hurt and threatened by their pregnancies, and those who simply do not want them - and grieve for them. Grieve, and wonder about what other lives they might have led, if they had a choice.\n\nMoira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

      "text": "Divided States of America: Roe v Wade is 'precursor to larger struggles'\n\nThe demise of the 1973 ruling could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appears to be two irreconcilable nations\n\n\"You put your babies in the womb, you will be held accountable!\" yelled Steve Corson, tall, bearded and jabbing a finger at women who chanted back: \"My body, my choice!\"\n\nCorson took a deep breath and blew into a shofar. Then Nathan Darnell, wearing a \"Jesus Christ is king\" cap and holding aloft a cross, grabbed a megaphone.\n\n\"You guys are demon-possessed!\" declared the 19-year-old from Haymarket, Virginia. \"You guys are controlled by demons, all of you. Every child has a right to life.\"\n\nSuddenly Darnell was surrounded by abortion rights protesters brandishing placards. He kept talking.\n\n\"You guys are evil. The downfall of America is because of every one of you.\"\n\nThe national day of prayer last Thursday was anything but a solemn occasion outside the supreme court in Washington, where hours earlier an unscalable black fence had been erected , reminiscent of the one that surrounded the US Capitol after the January 6 insurrection.\n\nThe fury was unleashed by a leaked draft opinion that showed the nation's highest court provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that effectively legalised abortion. It was a political earthquake that revealed American women are perilously close to losing a fundamental right.\n\nIt was also a milestone in America's seemingly inexorable journey from United States to divided states. The likely demise of Roe v Wade could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appear to be two irreconcilable nations coexisting under one flag.\n\nLiberal states would become sanctuaries for women seeking abortions and saturated with providers; conservative states would turn into deserts that ban the procedure and criminalise doctors who provide it. Some wonder if the country's social fabric, frayed by four years of Donald Trump's presidency, can survive.\n\n\"The death of Roe is going to tear America apart,\" ran the headline of a New York Times column by Michelle Goldberg, which concluded that \"the death of Roe will intensify our national animus, turning red states and blue into mutually hostile legal territories. You think we hate each other now? Just wait until the new round of lawsuits start.\"\n\nSimon Schama, a historian, tweeted : \"When Roe vs Wade is overturned it will be time to find a different name for this country.\"\n\nThe supreme court's draft majority opinion, written by Samuel Alito and circulated on 10 February, was leaked to Politico on Monday. It argued in contemptuous tones that Roe v Wade \"was egregiously wrong from the start\" and \"enflamed debate and deepened division\".\n\nFour other Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - agreed that Roe \"must be overruled\". If that decision becomes final, possibly next month, it will tear down a national precedent and turn America into a chaotic legal patchwork.\n\nThe first restrictions would take effect in 13 states with so-called trigger laws to be enacted once Roe is overturned. Some such laws ban abortions almost completely while others would outlaw it after six or 15 weeks. The speed of trigger laws could vary. In Texas, a near-total ban would go into effect 30 days after a supreme court decision.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute , a research and policy organisation, estimates that 26 of 50 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe is overturned, leaving women in swaths of the south-west and midwest without access. In 11 states there would be no exemptions for rape and incest. Republicans in Louisiana are even considering a bill that would allow prosecutors to charge those having abortions with homicide .\n\nMost states where abortion would still be legal are on the west coast or in the north-east. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, on Monday proposed enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution. In Oregon, Democrats recently passed a bill to create a $15m fund to assist with the costs of abortion, including for women from outside the state.\n\nWomen might have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. This is likely to be especially difficult for women in poverty, often including women of colour, and lead to a sharp climb in unsafe abortions. Republican-led states have already made efforts to restrict abortion pills, which can be prescribed through online visits.\n\nThere have been fierce disputes over healthcare, immigration and race in recent years - the journalist Carl Bernstein has spoken of a \" cold civil war \" - but few can match the raw emotional power of reproductive rights. That much was clear outside the fortified supreme court on Thursday, as two vociferous groups faced off.\n\nRev Patrick Mahoney , director of the Christian Defense Coalition, said into a microphone: \"We look forward to the day when abortion ends up on the scrap heap of history like chattel slavery and segregation .\"\n\nRochelle Rubin , about 20 paces away, shouted: \"You don't have a uterus! Shut up!\"\n\nHer voice shaking, Rubin, 50, an estate agent and lawyer, explained later: \"This is personal for me. I was born the last year that women could not have abortions. My mother had no choice. Had she made the choice she would have had me, but women of her generation did not have choice.\n\n\"If I didn't have a choice, my life would be very different today than it would have been. Ten years years ago I exercised my choice and had an abortion. For 50 years you can have a right - and it could be taken away by five people .\"\n\nEven as abortion rights activists shouted \"Keep your rosaries off my ovaries!\" and held placards such as \"Women's bodies are more regulated than guns\", Mahoney said he was \"overjoyed\" by the draft opinion but acknowledged the societal shockwaves.\n\nHe said: \"Can America get any more divided than we are? Tragically, yes it can. We certainly saw that happen on January 6, which was tragic. I would say we have to find a way to address this. Let's deal locally so if you have California on one end and Alabama on another end, let's just work on that.\"\n\nMahoney, 68, added: \"What you see on the streets is the cutting edge of the cultural fault lines that we see in our country. We saw that with the tragic murder of George Floyd . But our nation went through this upheaval and we're moving forward so that's what I hope happens here.\"\n\nThe interview was repeatedly interrupted as Mahoney broke off to restrain fellow anti-abortion activists from confronting female protesters.\n\n\"That's not who we are,\" he said, and it was true that women from the opposing sides engaged in civil conversations while in fundamental disagreement.\n\nBut Corson, 65, from Fredonia, Arizona, gripping his shofar and the Stars and Stripes, was more aggressive. He said: \"I don't respect their view at all. They didn't come out with 'My body, my choice' when it came to the [Covid] vaccine.\n\n\"They have a human body inside them; we speak for that human body; they're just speaking for themselves. I get sick and tired of these people. They are very corrupt and evil and on the wrong side. It is going to get heated up, no doubt about it. It should. It's a good issue to get heated up about .\"\n\nThe great divide on abortion is not a 50-50 split. It is asymmetric. A poll released by the Data for Progress thinktank after this week's leak showed voters wanted to keep Roe by a two-to-one margin. Democrats, independents and more than a third of Republicans support it.\n\nIts imminent fall is due to a quirk of US democracy that skews the electoral college, Senate and supreme court out of kilter with the popular will. Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump , who lost the national popular vote by 3m, after Senate Republicans blocked Barack Obama's last nominee, Merrick Garland.\n\nThis sense of injustice at this democratic deficit - which gives significantly more representation to white citizens than citizens of colour - is only likely to incite anger and dissent as blue states go one way and red states go the other.\n\nElaine Kamarck , a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: \"The basic structure of politics with all these small rural states being essentially overrepresented is creating the situation where minorities can control the majority. People are going to be furious about it.\n\n\"Already friends of mine in New York City talk about not letting their tax dollars go to red states because the irony is that all the blue states send more money to the federal government than they get back and the goddam red states take all the money and then try to run the lives of everybody in the blue states.\n\n\"So there really is a war going on and it's a cultural war but it's one that they [Republicans] are destined to lose.\"\n\nIf Roe is struck down, Kamarck noted , it will be the clearest differentiation of rights by state since the era of Jim Crow, when some states racially segregated public places and others did not. This could be a recipe for battles over sovereignty, with red states passing laws to \"extradite\" anyone who helps their residents get an abortion and blue states passing laws to shield their own doctors.\n\nStates have been drifting apart for years, across fault lines characterised as liberal v conservative, Black v white, urban v rural, college-educated v blue collar, Hollywood v heartland, mask wearers v vaccine sceptics and MSNBC v Fox News. The 2016 presidential election was framed as Trump's \"deplorables\" against Hillary Clinton's \"coastal elites\". The supreme court looks ready to toss a grenade into the mix.\n\nBarbara Walter , a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, said: \"What I fear will happen is that it will further create this urban-rural divide where the more moderate and liberal voices in red states will move, or their children will move, because they will not want their rights restricted.\n\n\"If you're a big corporation that employs a lot of women, are you going to move to states where they and their daughters are not treated equally or they're under these increasingly restrictive and medieval laws?\"\n\nThe fight is under way. A liberal group published the addresses of conservative supreme court justices and encouraged protesters to walk by them. A day of action for abortion rights is planned for Saturday . The issue could also galvanise Democratic turnout in November's midterm elections.\n\nEric Swalwell , a Democratic congressman from California, said: \"There will be an effort to turn out young women and their male allies when that decision comes. I hope it doesn't have to happen but I think it's going to be the backfire of the century for Republicans.\"\n\nThe Senate will vote on legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law but Democrats do not have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, which means the Joe Biden-backed effort will fail.\n\nThere have never been so few Republicans who support abortion rights, nor have there ever been so few Democrats who call themselves \"pro-life\".\n\nFareed Zakaria, an author and broadcaster, warned in the Washington Post: \"You cannot really understand America anymore by looking at averages. It has become two countries. One is urban, more educated, multiracial, secular and largely left of center. The other is rural, less educated, religious, white and largely right of center.\"\n\nBlue America would fit comfortably with northern European Protestant countries, Zakaria said, while red America's cultural values make it closer to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"For the country's political future, the central question is now this: can these two Americas find a way to live, work, cooperate with and tolerate one another? If not, the abortion battle may be the precursor to even larger struggles.\"\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

      "text": "Christian Wade: 'I see myself in Louis Rees-Zammit, he's facing the same challenges'\n\nGloucester wing is targeting Chris Ashton's try-scoring record after a spell in the NFL and at Racing 92 in France\n\nIn another life Christian Wade would have been playing for the Bills against the Ravens over the weekend, not scoring a hat-trick for Gloucester in their win at Bristol on Friday.\n\nWade, 33, is back in the Premiership after six years away, four of them in the NFL , and two more playing rugby for Racing 92 in France. He has already made headlines by saying he is determined to break Chris Ashton's record and become the league's all-time leading try scorer (he needs 17 more to do it) but underneath all that swagger, he has become a fascinating athlete to talk to; older, wiser, more reflective after his years away. He has done more living than a lot of people in his line of work.\n\nWade never actually made it on to the pitch for the Bills in a league game. He famously scored a 65-yard touchdown with his very first carry in a pre-season match against the Colts, but that was about as good as it got. He spent the next three years on and off the Bills' practice squad, which is more of an achievement than it sounds.\n\nThere are more than 73,000 college footballers in the US, and around 16,000 of them are eligible for the 250 slots in the NFL draft. Among them, Wade was just another prospect, competing against men who knew a hell of a lot more about the sport. Most of what he knew he learned \"playing Madden\".\n\nWade's background in American football actually goes a little deeper than that NFL video game . He was first tapped up in 2015, by Jason Bell, Osi Umenyiora and a couple of other NFL players. Intrigued by their confidence in him, he spent his off-days that rugby season training in secret at Tottenham, \"learning how to catch the ball correctly, how to hold the ball correctly\" and all the other basics.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars offered him a contract on the strength of his video footage, but he turned it down because he had only just made the British & Irish Lions tour in 2013, and wanted to try to play for England at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIt's the same sort of decision Louis Rees-Zammit faced when he made the move this year. Like Wade, Rees-Zammit went into the NFL's international player pathway, which is designed to help elite athletes in other sports to make the hop across to American football. It's a hard road. A few men on it have come close to breaking through, but only one has really made it big, the Australian rugby league player Jordan Mailata, who is now a standout offensive tackle for the Eagles. Wade says he and Rees‐Zammit are due a catchup, they've been swapping text messages, but Rees-Zammit hasn't been able to find the time for a phone call yet.\n\nWhich Wade gets. Because the hardest part of making the move was how busy he was. He had to do a lot of work to catch up with the people he was competing against. It wasn't physical, Wade was strong enough, and fast enough, to hold his own (if he hadn't been, the Bills wouldn't have wanted him), and he says a lot of NFL players would struggle to make it through 80 minutes of professional rugby. It was the mental side, especially the time he had to spend mastering the playbook. Working days in NFL pre-season ran from 8am to 8pm, with two hours of training and then eight or so of meetings and video analysis.\n\nIn the evenings Wade would go back home and have his wife \"pretend to be the quarterback so I could practise all this stuff in the living room\".\n\nAll those hours of work were worth crucial split seconds. \"It's one thing you can run fast but the amount of information you have to take in before the snap is the bit that will slow you down, because you'll be thinking rather than moving. So that's the challenge, and I think I saw a little bit of that in Louis's pre-season games.\n\nSign up to The Breakdown\n\nThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"I recognised myself in him, and a lot of the other guys who came over from the UK. You're fast, but you're slowing down because you're doing a lot of thinking.\" Meanwhile, everyone else is playing on instincts honed by years of school and college football, the same way Wade is able to do in rugby. \"It probably took me two or three years to really get to that stage where I felt really comfortable,\" Wade says. And that was when the injury happened. He did his shoulder, and was out for the season. The Bills cut him, even though he had two years left on his contract, which was when he came back to rugby.\n\nThe Bills' ruthlessness was another big difference between the sports. Wade says the NFL can be a lot more cut-throat. It means there's a lot more emphasis on individual responsibility.\n\n\"The biggest difference was that the players are a lot more driven. They don't need to be spoon-fed.\" In the UK, he says, and especially in rugby, players can get too comfortable. \"They can think: 'I'm good at what I do, I've got three years on my contract, and I know I'm going to get paid even if they want to get rid of me.'\" In the NFL, he says, no one is going to tell you to take extra care with your recovery, or your nutrition. You either do it, or you get cut.\n\nIf the responsibilities were greater, so were the rewards. The NFL is just about the richest and best-run sports league in the world, and Wade has come back to a sport that is in a state of flux. He was talking in the buildup to the NFL's upcoming London Series of three fixtures at Tottenham and Wembley, part of a 17-year-long investment in overseas markets, and it is paying off.\n\nData gathered by the ticket sales platform Viagogo shows that this year, for the first time, a majority of the paying fans for the series are from the UK rather than the US. The UK is now the NFL's second-biggest market. There is always talk about the possibility of a London franchise.\n\nWade will have one eye on it, watching with interest. But for now he's got the other on the try‐line. \"Rugby's my sport,\" he says, happy to be back."

The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent.\n\n\"Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.\n\n\"In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.\"\n\nFive Republican-nominated judges were among the majority. The court ruled the state could regulate the procedure during the second trimester and even ban it in most circumstances in the third.\n\n\"We do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake,\" Blackmun wrote.\n\n\"We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct.\"\n\nJustices Byron White, a Democratic appointee, and Republican-nominated William Rehnquist, later US chief justice, dissented.\n\nThe decision provoked a firestorm among social and judicial conservatives, who have long sought to undermine or overturn it."

I wish you the best in your future endeavors.\"\n\nThe ruling by the Fulton county superior court judge Scott McAfee stopped short of disqualifying Willis, which Trump and his co-defendants had sought over allegations that the relationship was a conflict of interest.\n\nThe decision avoided catastrophe for Willis. An order removing her and her office from the case would have almost certainly delayed the prosecution significantly during reassignment to another prosecutor in Georgia, who might have opted to toss the charges altogether.\n\nAlthough the judge found the evidence insufficient to disqualify her from bringing the case, he was unsparing in his criticism of the way Willis so casually handled the relationship and the manner of her testimony on the witness stand during a series of hearings on the matter.\n\nThe Wade-Willis relationship amounted to such a fatal appearance of impropriety that one of the pair needed to resign even if no actual conflict of interest existed, the judge wrote, making clear that the commingling of personal and professional relations was untenable.\n\nShortly after Willis announced that she had accepted Wade's resignation, Trump went on his Truth Social site and said the development was \"BIG STUFF\".\n\n\"The Fani Willis lover, Mr Nathan Wade Esq, has just resigned in disgrace,\" Trump wrote , among other things.\n\nSign up to Trump on Trial\n\nStay up to date on all of Donald Trump's trials.

Willis and Wade admitted to having a relationship but said it did not begin until after Wade had been hired to work on the Trump case in 2022.\n\nThe case being led by Willis's office contains only some of the dozens of criminal charges against Trump for subversion of his failed 2020 re-election run, retention of classified documents and hush-money payments. In civil litigation, Trump has been found liable of sexual abuse of writer E Jean Carroll and has been adjudicated as having committed business fraud.\n\nTrump nonetheless has secured the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent Joe Biden for a second presidency in November."

      "text": "A \"Woodstock\" for Right-Wing Legal Activists Kicked Off the 40-Year Plot to Undo Roe v. Wade\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTwo hundred conservatives gathered at Yale Law School and coalesced into a group whose name was a joke: the Federalist Society.\n\nIn the early Reagan years, religious right movement leaders Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell knew that they could not solely rely on fickle politicians to implement their plan on a national scale. They didn't have public opinion on their side - certainly not on legal abortion, nor on other elements of their plan to maintain their privilege and power. In order to implement their anti-democratic policy agenda and political philosophy, they needed the influence and power of a court system impervious to the will of voters. In that pursuit, an institution named the Federalist Society became their main vehicle.\n\nIn 1982, a group of conservative students and professors gathered at Yale Law School giddy with the opportunity offered by Ronald Reagan's presidency. They spent the time discussing the perils of federalism, decrying the cultural influence of \"coastal elites,\" and listening to speakers who excoriated everything from New Deal politics to the legalization of abortion and its impact on \"acceptable sexual behavior.\" This relatively small crew of around 200 began the process of building a language and a culture around constitutional originalism, a designed approach of interpreting the Constitution very narrowly based on what the framers - all white, all men, all Christian - supposedly meant at the time they wrote it. They named the new group the Federalist Society as a bit of an inside joke. One of the organizers wrote to invite future Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork to help them, saying that the group \"settled on Federalist Society as a name which I suppose makes up in euphony what it lacks in accuracy. If you have any brilliant ideas for a better name, however, that would be splendid.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nLegal scholars from Bork to future Solicitor General Ted Olson and future Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia - then a law professor just months away from his first federal judgeship - spent the weekend deep in conversation with adoring students. They were all convinced that there was a desperate need for an antidote to what they believed was insidious left-wing bias in law schools. One of the student organizers, Steven Calabresi, recalled that \"part of Reagan's policy was to build up forces in battleground nations in order to topple enemy regimes, and I thought of us as kind of the same equivalent in law schools.\"\n\nPerhaps no speech better articulated the overarching mission of this new endeavor than that of Bork, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by Reagan, when he told the gathered students that the courts were legislating with made-up constitutional rights:\n\nThis is a process that is going on. It happens with the extension of the equal protection clause to groups that were never previously protected. When they began to protect groups that were historically not intended to be protected by that clause, what they are doing is picking out groups that should not have any disabilities laid upon them.\n\nGiven that Bork had excoriated the Civil Rights Act as being grounded in \"unsurpassed ugliness\" and had opposed Griswold v. Connecticut, which granted married couples the right to contraception, those who read the speech reasonably concluded that Bork did not include historically marginalized groups as meriting protection. This seminal speech was later invoked in Bork's Supreme Court nomination hearings and helped sink his chances at confirmation.\n\nThe weekend was a smashing success, with one prominent attendee comparing it to Woodstock for right-wing legal activists. The attendees left convinced that they were a silent majority, despite all evidence to the contrary. They believed that if they could make it socially permissible, many more students on college campuses would come out against liberalism. They emerged from the gathering energized to build the Federalist Society, a new effort to train and promote conservative-minded lawyers into prominent positions, with an eye toward installing far-right judges. Backed by a who's who of right-wing money, the fledgling group quickly grew from a handful of grassroots chapters on college campuses into a million-dollar organization with headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at least 75 campus affiliates. One of its initial backers was the John M. Olin Foundation, the force behind the establishment of business-friendly law and economics programs at law schools throughout the country.\n\nThe Federalist Society scoped out the legal aspect of Falwell and Weyrich's new strategy, and it found that abortion proved to be an excellent litmus test for likely members of the radical right. It turned out that young and ambitious legal minds who had an antipathy to Roe v. Wade were far more likely to be on board with the full agenda to assert control and maintain the status quo of right-wing power.\n\nEdwin Meese, a top aide to Reagan, hired many \"Federalists,\" as they came to call themselves. Other GOP operatives helped young, newly graduated Federalist Society lawyers find jobs. The movement was riding high when Chief Justice Warren Burger informed Reagan of his intent to retire in 1986. Reagan, in his second term with no reelection to plan for and chastened by the backlash to his Sandra Day O'Connor Supreme Court nomination, did two things: He moved to elevate right-wing ideologue William Rehnquist to occupy the position of chief justice. Then he nominated Federalist Society superstar Scalia to replace Rehnquist. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, center, speaks at the the Federalist Society half-day conference on \"The Legacy of the Rehnquist Court\" on Feb. 23, 2006, in Milwaukee. Photo: Darren Hauck/AP The fight over Rehnquist's ascension was bitter and divided. He had served on the court since 1972, having been nominated by President Richard Nixon. Rehnquist was a stalwart conservative cut from the same cloth as Weyrich. As a clerk for the Supreme Court, he had written a memo arguing against mandated school desegregation as the court considered Brown v. Board of Education. He consistently argued for prayer in school and capital punishment and against equal rights extending to gender and abortion rights - dissenting in the Roe case. His ascension was an affront to numerous causes and issues that Democrats had come to champion, and many fought his nomination bitterly. A witness testified to Rehnquist's efforts to suppress minority voting in the early 1960s and, in a heated argument, Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond overruled the request of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and others demanding more transparency and fact-finding. Rehnquist was finally confirmed by a vote of 65-33, and the Democratic holdouts were defeated.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, center, speaks at the the Federalist Society half-day conference on \"The Legacy of the Rehnquist Court\" on Feb. 23, 2006, in Milwaukee.\n\nThey were also exhausted. They voted to confirm Scalia the same day as the vote on Rehnquist. The Democrats had little fight left in them, and they had spent all of their political capital. Besides, the junior nominee was relatively unknown outside his own conservative legal circles, without an established paper trail on hot-button issues - a profile that became a staple of Federalist nominees. Scalia was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and went on to become one of the most right-wing justices in the history of the Supreme Court, upending norms by using oral arguments as political theater and writing scathing dissents in cases in which he was outnumbered.\n\nThe following year, Justice Lewis Powell - of the infamous Powell memo - announced his intention to step down, giving Reagan yet another opportunity to shape the court. Reagan drew again from the same well, nominating Federalist Society founding father Bork. The man who had used the original conference to decry \"the gentrification of the Constitution\" and to claim that states should be able to ban abortion and define \"acceptable sexual behavior\" was up. The new legions of Federalists were ecstatic about the possibility of having two of their own on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Democrats and progressives were not going to be caught flat-footed again. Opposition to Bork's nomination came fast and furious from civil rights and women's groups. Kennedy, who led the opposition, responded to the nomination by saying:\n\nRobert Bork's America is a land where women are forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police would break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government, and the doors of the federal courts would shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is - and is often the only - protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. ... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate, and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.\n\nThe extreme ideology on display at Bork's initial Federalist speech came back to haunt him in the lengthy confirmation battle. Bork's nomination was defeated in a bipartisan vote after months of bitter fighting. The seat ultimately went to Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. The Federalists were enraged and took a solemn vow to never let one of their own be sunk again.\n\nOther groups were also hard at work using law and the courts to tilt culture in the direction of the radical right's goals. In 1990, Christian televangelist Pat Robertson created the American Center for Law and Justice specifically to go head-to-head with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLJ held a stable of attorneys ready to jump into high-profile battles worldwide focused on its version of family values. The organization, today led by former President Donald Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow, has fought changes to the Kenyan constitution that would allow abortion, supported the government of Zimbabwe in its effort to criminalize homosexuality, and, closer to home, effectively blocked the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the World Trade Center site. Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, introduces former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015. Photo: Steve Helber/AP In 1993, prominent evangelical Christian ministers founded the Alliance Defending Freedom to advance \"religious freedom, sanctity of life, and marriage and family\" through legal advocacy and funding court cases that tested legal precedent. In 1994, a Catholic lawyer named Kevin J. \"Seamus\" Hasson used seed money from the Knights of Columbus to round out these efforts with the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm solely devoted to promoting \"religious liberty.\" All of these groups shared a fundamental belief that their way of life was under attack and aimed to use the courts to impose a traditionalist, Christian ideology on the American public, echoing the demands for \"religious liberty\" that the radical right had first tested on its pro-segregation work in the 1960s.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, introduces former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015.\n\nThey subsequently joined in common cause to choose a series of high-profile cases that they believed would cement the idea that liberal reforms around civil rights and gender equity amounted to an attack on traditional religion. In California, the ACLJ and its allies aggressively defended Proposition 8, the ballot measure designed to ban same-sex marriage in the state. Their rhetoric presented out-of-touch elites trying to foist a liberal agenda on the rest of the nation. In 2018, the Alliance Defending Freedom advocated in the Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which dealt with religious business owners' ability to refuse service to people based on their sexual orientation, for similar reasons.\n\nPerhaps the feather in the cap of the movement architects - some of whom did not live to see this day - was their victory in the 2014 Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act had mandated long overdue reform that contraception be covered by insurance at no extra cost to the employee. The owners of the craft supply chain Hobby Lobby sought to deny their employees this coverage, using their go-to claim that it violated their religious beliefs. Core to the plaintiffs' case was the claim that the owners of Hobby Lobby believed that some kinds of contraception were \"abortifacients.\" This term was straight out of anti-abortion propagandist John Willke's playbook. It suggested, with no grounding in medical fact, that birth control was tantamount to abortion. In a hotly contested 5-4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, opening the door to the erosion of all sorts of hard-won gains in the name of moral objection. Tellingly, the court's majority wrote that the fact that birth control did not actually cause abortions was irrelevant in this context. For a violation of religious liberty to occur, the plaintiff must only believe that it could happen. Four of the five justices who ruled in Hobby Lobby's favor had Federalist Society ties.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby case was a massive triumph for the radical right, underscoring the effectiveness of the mutually reinforcing strategies. The movement had effectively used abortion as a Trojan horse to move the goalpost, limit access to contraception, and enshrine disinformation into the legal canon. For them, it was icing on the cake that the victory undercut the ACA, a crowning achievement for the much-loathed Obama administration. They had effectively reversed one of the most significant national steps forward for gender equity in decades.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the first week of May 2022, a draft decision penned by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press laying bare the intention of the majority of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many legal experts warned immediately that the draft was written to not only eradicate the current federal protection to abortion access, but also to lay the legal groundwork to undo a whole host of other rights guaranteed through the 14th Amendment protecting privacy and equality for all individuals.\n\nAlito repeated a common refrain from right-wing leaders and judges all the way back to Bork that the original interpretation of the 14th Amendment was just wrong. The ground is being set to review and revoke so many hard-won gains, from access to birth control to marriage quality. Six of the current occupants of the Supreme Court were nurtured and backed by the Federalist Society: Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts. The architects' plan has finally come to fruition, but this is only the beginning, not the end, of their quest to make sure we're all living in a world of their creation.\n\nThis article was adapted from the bestselling book \" The Lie That Binds,\" by Ilyse Hogue and Ellie Langford .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "In Overturning Roe, Radical Supreme Court Declares War on the 14th Amendment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAlito's opinion completely elides the significance of the 14th Amendment, which was explicitly designed to address the particular horrors of slavery, including the right of individuals to determine whether, with whom, and when to form a family.\n\nLess than an hour after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution no longer recognizes the right to abortion, and that the decision about whether individuals enjoy reproductive freedom should be decided by individual states, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt was ready.\n\nIn a four-page letter sent to the state's Revisor of Statutes, Schmitt wrote that he was pulling the trigger on the state's blanket ban on abortion - a law that had been sitting dormant, waiting for Roe v. Wade to fall. \"With this attorney general opinion, my Office has effectively ended abortion in Missouri, becoming the first state in the country to do so following the Court's ruling,\" he said in a press release.\n\nDuring a subsequent press call, Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said that the state's sole remaining abortion clinic had gone dark. \"Shortly after the decision came down, we notified the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services that we are ceasing abortion services in the state of Missouri. We have reached the end of the line for abortion care,\" she said. \"Today is the worst-case scenario for the 1.3 million people of reproductive age who live in the state of Missouri, where abortion is now banned.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIndeed, with the fall of Roe, 22 states are poised to ban abortion almost immediately; four other states are expected to follow suit . Thirteen of those states have sleeper, so-called trigger bans on the books, like Missouri, that will now rapidly take effect across a large swath of the country. In all, tens of millions of people of reproductive age will be left without access to abortion.\n\nThe court's consequential ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization represents the culmination of decades of conservative ideological assault on reproductive freedom. And it opens a door for the court's 6-3 supermajority to strike down a host of other protections grounded in the Constitution's promise of individual liberty that the court declares in Dobbs are not actually rooted in \"history and tradition\" - including the right to use contraception, the right to consensual sexual relations, and the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nStill, the text of the majority ruling, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, is not entirely new: The substance of the ruling has not changed since a leaked draft of the opinion was published by Politico in May. As he did in the leaked opinion, Alito goes on at length about how history doesn't include a right to abortion (notably citing the \"great\" Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th century judge who sentenced two \"witches\" to death and advocated for a husband's right to rape his wife); gives a nod to the ahistorical idea that abortion is akin to eugenics; and seems perplexed by the idea that any reliance interests may have developed around the 50-year-old abortion precedent - in other words, he can't see how generations of people may have internalized the guarantee that they have the right to plan and control their reproductive lives.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMost consequentially, perhaps, is the majority's cramped and somewhat confusing view of the individual liberty rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. According to the Alito majority, there are two limited categories of rights protected by it: Those specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments - like the ( apparently absolute ) right to bear arms - and those that comprise \"a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.\" And where that select list is concerned, Alito writes that the court must basically determine whether a right was considered as such in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was ratified. He concludes that abortion wasn't firmly accepted then and so cannot be considered so now.\n\nIn fact, Alito's opinion scoffs at the idea that individual liberty would include a person's ability to make autonomous intimate personal choices. \"While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about 'existence,' 'meaning,' the 'universe,' and 'the mystery of human life,' they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts,\" he wrote. \"These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one's 'concept of existence' prove too much.\" That criteria, \"at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like,\" he wrote.\n\nAlito's opinion completely elides the significance of the 14th Amendment, a Reconstruction-era addition explicitly designed to address some of the particular horrors of slavery , including ensuring the right of individuals to determine whether, with whom, and when to form a family. \"These explicit protections for equality and liberty were written into our national charter at a time when the question of what it truly meant to be free, as a matter of law, was urgent and pressing,\" Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said in a statement. \"The Fourteenth Amendment provided this measure of equality and more. The Court's conservative majority - which claims to follow text and history where it leads - instead turns a blind eye to these central precepts at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe majority's position also fails to engage with another obvious point: The 14th Amendment was ratified by white, property-owning men - in other words, women weren't contemplated as equal under the law. Taking the majority's logic at face value, that would mostly remain the case.\n\nIn their dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan grapple with this problem directly and at length. \"Of course, 'people' did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for women's liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation,\" they wrote. \"When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship.\"\n\nThe point of a constitutional right is to protect it against \"all comers,\" the dissent wrote. But by undoing decades of protections for reproductive freedom, the majority has unleashed sweeping changes that will leave individuals vulnerable to the whims of various state politicians. \"Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl her father's - no matter if doing so will destroy her life,\" the justices wrote. \"So too, after today's ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies ... sure to die within a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm,\" they continued. \"Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child.\"\n\n\"Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's decision is certain: the curtailment of women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\"\n\nUnmooring abortion from individual liberty rights also jeopardizes any number of rights similarly understood to have a home in the 14th Amendment, the dissent warns. \"The Constitution will, today's majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all,\" they wrote. \"And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.\"\n\nAbortion rights rose directly from the right to contraception, as decided in 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut and its progeny. \"In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions.\"\n\nIn the majority opinion, Alito disregards this concern, insisting that none of the other rights are in jeopardy because abortion is different - because it involves potential life - and accusing the dissent of stoking \"unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights.\" Still, at least part of the majority isn't signing on to this assurance. In a concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote explicitly that those other rights should be overturned. While he agreed that the right to contraception, consensual sex, and same-sex marriage weren't on the table in the Dobbs case, he wrote that they're actually no different from abortion in that they too have no 14th Amendment protection and thus must go. \"No party has asked us to decide 'whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,'\" he wrote. But in the future they should consider the entire class of rights, because any granted on that basis are \"demonstrably erroneous,\" he wrote, and \"we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nDuring a press call, Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who argued the Dobbs case before the court on behalf of the Jackson Women's Health Organization, called the ruling cataclysmic. \"The Supreme Court has taken away people's ability to make basic decisions about their bodies, lives, and health,\" she said. \"Generations of people have relied on this right, and they'll now be thrown into a world without it.\" It is \"the biggest rollback of women's rights in our history.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Roe v. Wade Is About to Be Struck Down by the Electoral College\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFour of the justices voting to overturn Roe were appointed by presidents initially elected while losing the popular vote.\n\nRoe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to abortion, was decided 7-2.\n\nAccording to Politico , the Supreme Court will soon strike down Roe v. Wade on a 5-4 vote.\n\nWhile the U.S. right has organized for decades in hopes of this result, it would never have come close to success without one factor: the Electoral College. There have been eight presidential elections over the past 30 years, and also eight Supreme Court vacancies. The bizarre reality of the U.S. political system is that Republicans have won the popular vote in just one of the eight elections, but got to choose five of the eight new justices. Of these five GOP picks, four are reportedly voting to reverse Roe.\n\nIn an alternate history in which presidents were elected by a simple plurality of voters, Roe would likely soon be upheld in the relevant case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, by a 7-2 or even 8-1 margin - assuming that the court even heard Dobbs in the first place.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nHere are the details of this history:\n\nPolitico's article features a draft opinion striking down Roe, which was written by Justice Samuel Alito. Politico also reports that Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett will vote with Alito.\n\nGorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett were appointed by President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won the Electoral College 304-227, thanks to extremely narrow victories in key states. Yet Trump got just 46.1 percent of the popular vote, while Hillary Clinton received 48.2 percent. In numerical terms, 65.854 million Americans voted for Clinton, while 62.985 million voted for Trump - an almost 3 million margin for Clinton.\n\nMoreover, voter turnout in 2016 was, by one way of measuring it, 59.2 percent. This means that just 27.3 percent of eligible voters chose Trump. Yet he was able to pick a third of the current Supreme Court. (And, of course, there were three vacancies for Trump rather than two because then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky refused to even allow a vote for the vacancy when Antonin Scalia died in 2016, during Barack Obama's presidency.)\n\nThen there's Alito, who was nominated by George W. Bush in 2005. Officially, Bush won the Electoral College against then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000 by a margin of 271-266. In reality, a study of Florida ballots released in November 2001 found that Gore actually won the state, under any counting standard, and thus actually won the Electoral College vote. But since this was just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, no one dared bring it up.\n\nGore also won the popular vote, 48.4 percent to 47.9 percent. Over half a million more Americans voted for Gore than Bush. Voter turnout in 2000 was 54.3 percent, meaning Bush was the choice of 26.0 percent of eligible voters.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIt is true that Bush won both the Electoral College and the popular vote against John Kerry in 2004. However, it's extremely unlikely that Bush would have run again if he'd lost in 2000. The last time a president got his party's nomination, lost, and then got the nomination again and won, was Richard Nixon 54 years ago in 1968. Perhaps another Republican would have beaten Gore in 2004, or perhaps not.\n\nThe remaining justice apparently poised to strike down Roe is Thomas, who was appointed by George H.W. Bush. Bush won both the Electoral College and popular vote in 1988.\n\nOf course, it's impossible to know precisely how history would have played out if the United States had a system in which the candidate who got the most votes became president. But polls show that overturning Roe has been deeply unpopular for as long as the question's been asked. So if the composition of the Supreme Court reflected anything close to the perspective of most Americans, this day would never have come. Now that it's here, it's hard to know whether the court will retain any legitimacy. The basic facts suggest that it should not.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How a Supreme Court Investigation of the Roe v. Wade Leak Might Unfold\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe leak investigation of the draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade raises important issues for journalists as well as potential sources.\n\nFollowing the publication by Politico of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's draft majority opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, Chief Justice Roberts authenticated the leaked document and stated that he had \"directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.\" Whether or not the leak itself was illegal , however, the question of how a technical investigation of this document would proceed raises some interesting issues for journalists as well as potential sources.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nLeak investigators have three key areas to analyze for clues: the document itself, the environment the document circulated in, and the potential identity of the leaker. Each area in turn presents lessons and opportunities for would-be leakers to adopt various counter-forensic strategies to subvert future leak investigations.\n\nSince the leaked opinion appears to be a scan or photocopy of a paper document instead of a transcription or recreation, the image can be analyzed for any unique markings that might allow investigators to pinpoint which particular physical copy of the document was leaked.\n\nThe first page includes several such potentially unique identifying markers, including a highlighted title, a page bend, and what appear to be staple perforations. Screenshot: The Intercept Other pages also reveal subtle markings that could identify the specific paper copy of the leaked document. For instance, the bottom-left region of page 90 has a singular speck; the fact that it is not present on other page images indicates that it is a stray mark present only on that physical page of the document, as opposed to being a dust flake on the scanner bed. Screenshot: The Intercept If investigators managed to locate a physical copy of the document matching the characteristics found in the leaked file, that would allow them to conclude that it was the physical copy that was leaked. This is significant, because it could establish the provenance of the document, which could in turn identify potential leakers.\n\nFor instance, if it were known that this particular physical copy of the document was handled by certain specific persons, those individuals would naturally fall under suspicion - though of course a scenario exists in which someone outside the intended chain of custody could have obtained the physical copy, for instance, simply by picking it up from someone else's desk or by finding it on a photocopier. Then again, there is also the possibility that the original source of the document is digital and that the source printed out a copy prior to leaking it, or that Politico itself printed out the digital copy prior to publishing it.\n\nInvestigators could also analyze the metadata of the digital version of the document using software such as ExifTool for any clues about when, where, how, or by whom the digital copy was created. They could also exploit potential information-leaking vulnerabilities in the PDF creation and redaction process, which could inadvertently leave unintended and potentially identifying information in the digital document.\n\nIn addition to the document itself, leak investigators will likely pay attention to the environment in which the leak originated. Modern commercial office printers generally come with a variety of ancillary functions like photocopying and scanning, while also typically keeping a running log of jobs the printer performs, which may include such information as the file name and page count of the document, the date and time the job was performed, as well as the username or IP address that initiated the job. If the printer also offers the capability to email a photocopy or scan of a document, a log may keep track of which jobs were sent to which email addresses and could even store a copy of the digital document in its memory.\n\nInvestigators will likely perform an audit of printer and network logs to see which staff members opened or otherwise interacted with the document in question. Investigators could also explore who had occasion to access the document as part of their day-to-day duties, as well as where the particular copy of the leaked document was physically stored, and who had occasion to access that space.\n\nThe practice of anomaly-based insider threat detection involves investigating staff who display any kind of irregular behavior or activity. For instance, if a staff member usually swipes into the office on work days at 8 a.m. and swipes out at 5 p.m., but access logs show them coming into the office at 10 p.m. on a Saturday in the days leading up to the leak, this finding would likely subject that staff member to scrutiny, which could include analyzing available surveillance footage.\n\nStaff computer and phone usage, particularly web browsing, could also be analyzed to see if anyone previously visited the news site that published the leak, in this case Politico, or visited other webpages of potential interest, such as any that describe whistleblowers or leaking . Rudimentary analysis could include looking through desktop browsing history, while a more thorough and sophisticated investigation would involve analyzing network traffic logs to determine whether Politico was accessed from a mobile device connected to the office Wi-Fi. Though of course in the case of Politico, a news website that covers politics and policy, it is likely to show up in quite a lot of staff logs and thus would likely not be a particularly fruitful finding for investigators.\n\n\"Sentiment analysis\" may also be performed as part of an insider threat investigation by analyzing the various thoughts and opinions expressed by staff members in office communications. This kind of analysis could also utilize what's often called \"open source intelligence,\" in the form of looking at staff social media postings to see if anyone had expressed interest in Politico, or any thoughts about the Alito opinion, or generally any signs of disgruntlement with their employer. Additionally, sentiment analysis may also include a review of staff postings on internal forums, as well as emails and private messages sent via channels controlled by the employer, such as direct messages sent over Slack .\n\nThese potential methods of leak investigation may also be interpreted as lessons for future leakers to evade identification by adopting a number of counter-forensic measures.\n\nTo reduce the potential amount of information investigators may glean from a leaked document, leakers could send journalists a transcription or reproduction of the document instead of the original source document itself. While a transcription of the document will not successfully pass a barium meal test - in which each individual is given a uniquely phrased copy of the document, sophisticated forms of which may deploy natural language watermarking , subtly altering the syntactic structure of every version of a document - it would nonetheless neutralize all other attempts at source document identification. Transcription would bypass efforts at identifying either errant or intentional markings on a page, as well as attempts at identifying positional watermarks such as subtle shifts in character or line spacing unique to each version of a document. Of course, this also would make it harder for journalists to verify a document's authenticity, and care would have to be taken to ensure that the source left no identifying metadata in the transcription file.\n\nOffice equipment would best be avoided when making copies of a document, but using personal equipment can also be fraught with risk. Source camera identification is the forensic process of identifying the camera that took a particular photo. At times, this sort of identification may hinge on obvious features such as visible scratches on a lens or dead pixels on a screen. In other situations, the unique characteristics of an image might not be visible to the naked eye, but instead might be based on the unique image sensor noise each camera produces, otherwise known as photo response non-uniformity .\n\nIn other words, if leaked photographs of a document were to emerge, and leak investigators had particular suspects in mind, they could analyze photos posted to social media by the suspects to see if they provide an algorithmic match to the noise pattern in the leaked photos. When making audio recordings or photographs, therefore, it would be best practice to adopt the principle of one-time use: Use a temporary device like a cheap camera or smartphone that will be used only for the purposes of the leak, and then discard the device.\n\nTo avoid falling afoul of anomaly-detection triggers, would-be leakers might consider incorporating document acquisition as part of their normal routine instead of engaging in uncharacteristic behavior like clocking in at the office at odd hours or downloading files en masse. Likewise, leakers should avoid browsing news outlets while at work, both on their personal and of course work devices. Expressing any kind of disagreement or dissatisfaction with employer policies or decisions on either a company, public, or personal forum (such as during happy hour drinks) is also best avoided, as rigorous insider threat monitoring may keep tabs of any such behavior.\n\nLeaking and subsequent leak investigations are back-and-forth games of forensics and counter-forensics, of operational security and its failures. While the risk of source identification can never be entirely eliminated, there are nonetheless various practical technical countermeasures which can be adopted to reduce the additional risk to sources who are already risking a great deal.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Wade, the nearly 50-year-old ruling that acknowledged the constitutional right to abortion. Although this is the most egregious attack on reproductive rights, it only follows the anti-abortion momentum that has been building for years around the country. This week on Intercepted, Intercept investigative reporter Jordan Smith discusses the aggressive, irrational, and dangerous Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Smith is joined by Melissa Murray, the Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law at New York University and co-host of \"Strict Scrutiny,\" a podcast about the Supreme Court. Smith and Murray talk through the draft decision, its implications, and the future of reproductive rights.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n[Intro music.]\n\nJordan Smith: I was a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Maryland when I found out I was pregnant. And I freaked out. I did not want to be pregnant.\n\nI knew I needed an abortion, but I didn't have the money.\n\nI gathered up a bunch of change and called my mom from a pay phone. And she didn't miss a beat when I told her I was pregnant. \"No, you're not,\" she said - and sent me the money that day.\n\nIt was 1991, nearly 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision changed abortion rights in the U.S. For me, once I had the money, the access was easy. I went on with my life, and I have never regretted my decision. Abortion was the reason I was able to stay in school, go on to graduate school, and develop my career.\n\nBut while I had a relatively easy time exercising the right conferred by Roe, that is far from a universal experience.\n\nFor many, Roe was always just a promise on paper. And for decades, those against reproductive freedom have worked with their conservative, elected allies to make abortion all but inaccessible for millions of people.\n\nI've watched this happen over the nearly two decades that I've covered assaults on reproductive health access. The burden has fallen disproportionately on people of color, those with low incomes, those living in more rural areas of the country, young people, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAnd now... the biggest attack on abortions rights is on the horizon.\n\n[Intercepted theme music.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nJS: I'm Jordan Smith, a senior reporter with The Intercept.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Politico obtained a leaked draft of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, is irrational, incredibly aggressive, and extremely dangerous for the future of reproductive freedom. Right now, that future looks bleak.\n\nSo joining me today to talk through the draft decision, its implications, and beyond is Melissa Murray, the Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law at New York University, and a co-host of one of my favorite podcasts about the Supreme Court, Strict Scrutiny.\n\nProfessor Murray, thank you for being here with us.\n\nProfessor Melissa Murray: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: I've been reporting on reproductive health access and abortion rights since about 2003, mostly in Texas. And so I've seen up close the relatively long and certainly consequential trajectory that puts us in this moment. And I think that's why I'm not surprised that we're here.\n\nBut, I was, nonetheless shocked by the leaked Alito opinion. And not necessarily the bottom line - [laughs] which was what I expected. But like, the shrieking, aggressive tone I found really unnerving, as well as the way in which he deploys some kind of wobbly facts and logic to get to his bottom line.\n\nAnd then, beyond that, I was pretty startled by the breadth of what he's laying out here - in other words, that this isn't just about abortion.\n\nSo before we get into the thick of all that, I think it's probably worth backing up for just a second to talk about the case that has brought us to this moment, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. So can you maybe just tell us the basics about the Dobbs case and how we've wound up where we are?\n\nMM: Sure. So Dobbs is a challenge to Mississippi HB 1510, which is a law that prohibits abortion at 15 weeks of gestation, well in advance of what is known as viability, which is a marker at which the fetus can survive outside of the womb, and typically it is marked at around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. So a 15-week ban is very much ahead of where the viability line is.\n\nViability is really important in the court's abortion jurisprudence because, despite the limitations and restrictions of a court has allowed on abortion rights, it has remained steadfast that Roe v. Wade, that 1973 opinion that announced the right of a woman in consultation with her physician to choose an abortion, they've been very steadfast that the right to an abortion includes the right to an abortion before viability without any bans. So it prevents the state from banning abortion before viability. And so that's critically important in why viability is such an important marker.\n\nObviously a law that restricts abortion, which bans abortion in advance of viability, runs afoul of Roe v. Wade. But interestingly, when Mississippi was defending its law, it was initially enjoined by the district court in a really amazing opinion by Judge Carlton Reeves, who is a district court judge in the Southern District of Mississippi. In that opinion, he enjoined the law on the grounds that it flagrantly violates existing Supreme Court precedent.\n\nWhen Mississippi challenged that all the way to the Supreme Court - they lost at every lower court because the law is plainly unconstitutional - when they filed their appeal at the Supreme Court, at first, their request of the court was relatively modest. So this was in 2019. And they just asked the court to rethink whether viability was a salient marker in the court's jurisprudence, if that continued to be the case. And they emphasized that this is not a big, monumental, cataclysmic kind of case; it was not going to completely reorient abortion jurisprudence. They were asking for some guidance on a very specific question - a tinkering at the edges kind of question.\n\nFast forward to 2020. In September of 2020, by the time the court has announced that it's going to take up this challenge, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed away, and she has been replaced on the Supreme Court by Amy Coney Barrett, a justice, who I think it's fair to say, was genetically modified in a lab for this moment. [Laughs.]\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: She's a staunch conservative, raised in the conservative legal movement. She, in some of her writings, and indeed, some of her personal dealings has expressed some skepticism of abortion rights, I think is a generous way to put it. And she's now seated where Ruth Bader Ginsburg once sat, and Ginsburg, of course, was one of the most steadfast and stalwart defenders of abortion rights on the court.\n\nSo it's a very different court, we've gone from a 5-4 majority to a 6-3 conservative supermajority. And not surprisingly, that change in personnel also prompts a change in Mississippi's posture in this litigation. So rather than focusing on a kind of incremental change, or a very minor question, when Mississippi finally filed its initial briefs before the court, in this case, in the fall of 2021, its requests are much more assertive. So instead of telling the court like: This is really modest kind of thing, tell us a little bit more about viability, they just sort of go balls to the wall and say: We want you to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the two pillars of the courts, abortion jurisprudence.\n\nAnd so that's where we found ourselves in December of 2021, when the court took up oral arguments in this case, and I think was very clear from oral arguments that there were five justices who were skeptical, if not outright hostile, to the prospect of retaining Roe v. Wade as stare decisis, that principle of the Anglo-American legal tradition that says that settled decisions are to be followed, regardless of the personal predispositions of the judges reviewing those precedents. Despite stare decisis, it seemed like there were five justices on the court who were ready and are able to overrule Roe v. Wade. So that's where we are.\n\nJS: Right. Right. Burn it down. [Laughs.] Which, of course, brings us to Alito's opinion. When I read it again, not surprised but kind of shocked because I was like: Bonkers! And deeply troubled, right?\n\nSo, I'm just curious: What was your initial reaction when you saw it?\n\nMM: So I wasn't shocked that there was an opinion overruling Roe v. Wade. I was actually shocked that Amy Coney Barrett hadn't written it.\n\nJS: Right. [Laughs.] Because like: Woman on the court! This is why you're here.\n\nMM: Well, it's not me saying this. Back in 2017, when they were sort of gearing up for a wave of nominations, including the anticipated retirement of Justice Kennedy, Ramesh Ponnuru, who is a conservative pundit, argued that President Trump - and this was in an op-ed that was published widely - President Trump should select Amy Coney Barrett, and one of the reasons he identified for her selection was that it would look really, really terrible for a very conservative court composed of four white men and one Black man to overrule Roe v. Wade. It'd be much better if a woman could put her feminine touch on it.\n\nSo that surprised me. It surprised me that given the moment, given this opportunity to overrule this long embattled precedent, that she was not the one to sort of finish the job. But Justice Alito is a worthy second runner-up to this. [Laughs.]\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: He's long expressed skepticism - if not hostility - for abortion rights. He's always been very clear about it. And so, if it wasn't Justice Barrett, then Justice Alito was a pretty sure second, and he did not disappoint.\n\nJS: No! No, he did not, did he? No, he did not.\n\nMM: He did not.\n\nJS: So let's talk a little about what he has in here. And one of the obvious things is that he writes that the word \"abortion\" isn't in the constitution. So the right doesn't exist.\n\nMM: You know, what also is not in the Constitution?\n\nJS: What?\n\nMM: Women!\n\nJS: Yes, that's true. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. We're not there, either. [Laughs.]\n\nMM: OK. So it all checks out. All tracks.\n\nJS : It does. It does, doesn't it? But, well, OK, fine, true: abortion, not in there. But the read he has seems to just elide completely over the protections guaranteed by the Ninth Amendment, right? And then articulated in the 14th Amendment, which we know is a Reconstruction-era addition, right, meant to kind of ensure some individual liberty, including this right to decide about family things like weather, and with whom to have a family. So I'm curious what you think of his analysis. And also, you've spoken really great about this. And I'm wondering if you could just sort of unpack the basis for and kind of the promise of the 14th amendment?\n\nMM: Sure.\n\nSo let me first explain his logic, and then I'll explain why I think it's incorrect and incoherent.\n\nJS: Please.\n\nMM: So he argues that there are two major problems with a right to abortion. And the first is that such a right is not specifically enumerated in the text of the Constitution as opposed to protections like freedom of speech or religious freedom, all of which he says, are very specifically enumerated in the Constitution. And that's kind of true, but kind of not. There are aspects of the First Amendment that we have come to accept as part of the First Amendment's guarantees that are not specifically enumerated; they're sort of implied from what is enumerated. So you know, that too, is, I think, a little bonkers.\n\nBut he sort of sets up this juxtaposition between these unenumerated and therefore problematic rights versus text-based rights. And he talks specifically about these Bill of Rights amendments. And of course, anyone who's seen Schoolhouse Rock! and has been sentient for much of middle school civics knows that the Bill of Rights is a series of 10 amendments. Justice Alito focuses only on eight and he needs to because he stopped short, as you say, of the Ninth Amendment, which says that, just because we have specifically enumerated certain rights here does not suggest or disparage the prospect of additional rights that might be implied and are not specifically enumerated.\n\nSo the Ninth Amendment kind of gives waste to his argument, because the Ninth Amendment specifically contemplates the prospect of rights that are not enumerated, but are nonetheless protected. And he doesn't address that. Nor could he, I think it's a real problem with his analysis. But it seems like the framers of the Constitution left a kind of failsafe there, like a safeguard, if you will, for situations like this, where people are saying, well: Here's what's listed, that's all there is. It's like: No, that's not all there is. There's this other stuff that can be implied from the premise of these existing amendments and also the sort of spirit of the Constitution.\n\nThat brings us to the 14th Amendment and the Reconstruction amendments more generally. As you suggest, the 14th Amendment is part of this trio of constitutional amendments that are passed in the wake of the American Civil War, and they're passed for a specific purpose. They are passed to abolish the institution of slavery, that's the 13th Amendment. They are passed to enfranchise African American men, so to make newly freed, formerly enslaved persons, members of the body politic and the political community. That's the 15th Amendment.\n\nThen there is also these provisions that are intended to specifically repudiate certain aspects of slavery, including the fact that enslaved persons had no right to marry, they had no right to their families, to any kind of family integrity, their children could be sold away from them. And perhaps most importantly, they had no control over their bodies, whether it was for labor or for sexual labor, right? Their bodies could be conscripted in any way their owners found permissible and useful.\n\nAnd so this trio of amendments was intended to repudiate all of this, to formally abolish the institution, to enfranchise African-American men and to repudiate these aspects of slavery. And I'm emphasizing this because the second part of Justice Alito is argument as to why the abortion right is problematic, it's not simply that it is unenumerated and not found in the text of the Constitution. It is also that it is not deeply rooted in the traditions of our country and in the history of our country. And as evidence of that, he cites the fact that there have been criminal prohibitions on abortion, which is true but there also have been lots of prohibitions on lots of things that I think we now would say should not have been prohibited.\n\nAnd, again, I come back to this idea that the Reconstruction amendments were intended to repudiate the vestiges of slavery, an institution that was so deeply embedded in the foundations of the country that you actually needed a cataclysmic event like amending the Constitution to root it out.\n\nSo I'm saying all of this to explain: I don't think he is right to say that this is an unenumerated rights. I think this is a right that very much is part of this idea of liberty that is specifically stated in the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment denies the state the opportunity to deprive individuals of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. This idea of liberty was understood capaciously by the drafters of the 14th Amendment, to include these things like family integrity, the right to marry, the right to your children, and again, the right to your body, your labor, your wages, all of these things.\n\nAnd so it is kind of specifically enumerated, it's just he doesn't have the same vision of liberty that I think the ratifiers of the 14th Amendment did. And it is deeply rooted in our history, because at least since 1868, our understanding of what liberty meant was this opportunity to control your body, to have access to your family, access to the right to marry, all of these things. And so, I think understanding this history of the 14th Amendment, and my NYU colleague Peggy Cooper Davis has written a magnificent book \"Neglected Stories: The Constitution and Family Values\" which is being re-released. And it lays all of this out. And it's all there, hiding in plain sight. It's in the legislative history behind these amendments. And he completely ignores it, and instead offers in this crabbed and narrow understanding of the 14th amendment and its guarantee of liberty. And it has to be crabbed. It has to be narrowed. Because otherwise I don't think you could rightly come to the conclusion that the Constitution strips women of the opportunity to control their reproductive capacities.\n\nJS: Well said. And I think that actually brings me the next point, which, kind of ironically, Alito then pedals this notion that abortion has been a tool to oppress Black people, and to essentially erase the Black race. And he writes \"Some such supporters have been motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the African American population,\" which is obviously certainly a nod to Clarence Thomas, who wrote that 2019 concurring opinion that linked abortion to eugenics, and obviously, that's troubling on multiple levels, not least of which is that an individual person terminating their own pregnancy is not eugenics.\n\nAnd you wrote this awesome Harvard Law Review article about the Thomas concurrence, and about how it's ahistorical and really kind of conflates some things. But but you also wrote in there, that instead of surfacing race, as a means of promoting greater autonomy and access to abortion, that he uses it as a way to sort of destabilize abortion rights. And I think that's a really great point, and kind of piggybacks on what you were just saying. And I was hoping you could just sort of unpack that a little bit more, because I think it's useful to talk about what Thomas gets wrong about how race and abortion interact, and what Alito seems to adopt, I guess, and try to use to his advantage, but also how we should think about the intersection of abortion and race. So take whatever piece of that you would like.\n\nMM: I'm going to take all of it.\n\nJS: OK.\n\nMM: There are three different strands that I'm going to weave together. So stay with me, right?\n\nJS: All right.\n\nMM: Let me explain this opinion, then, let me sort of talk about why I think Justice Thomas really misses the thread - quelle surprise! And then finally, I want to talk about why is that footnote, footnote 41, of this opinion included? Because it is entirely gratuitous, if you are overruling the right to an abortion based solely on the fact that it is atextual and ahistorical, right?\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: So you don't need this. And so the real question is, why is it there if we don't need it, and I want to hold on to that.\n\nSo, in 2019, as you say, there's this case on the shadow docket, recall the shadow docket, it's gotten a lot of press this year. It's called Fox v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky and it's a challenge to two laws: One is a law that requires the funereal disposal of fetal remains. The other is what is known as a reason ban or a trait-selection law that prohibits abortion if it is undertaken for purposes of race or sex selection or because of the diagnosis of a fetal anomaly.\n\nThe court took up the funereal disposals law and they upheld it. But they denied certiorari on the trait selection law, and Justice Thomas concurred and this was unusual because typically on the shadow docket decisions, there's just a sort of summary opinion of the court and you don't really understand the reasoning why they did what they did, but Justice Thomas decided to concur here, and he concurred specifically to agree that yes, we don't have to take this now, but the time is coming, when we will not be able to avoid this question of whether states can take modest steps to prevent abortion from fulfilling its quote-unquote eugenic potential.\n\nAnd that could have been the end of it, it would have been very weird. But it could have been the end of it.\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: But he decided to go further, and going further, he crafts this quite selective history in which he graphs the birth control movements history, and Margaret Sanger's history with the eugenics movement to the history of abortion.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And they are two very distinct histories, to be sure. Margaret Sanger, who was the mother of the modern birth control movement, was not necessarily in favor of abortion; she actually had deep antipathy for what she called surgical interventions and thought that none of this would be necessary if women could just have access to contraception. So, the shades of arguments we hear today.\n\nBut in the early 1900s, when she was sort of really mounting the birth control movement and this idea of voluntary motherhood, she was really trying to secure the support of these first-wave feminists who were really skeptical of Margaret Sanger because Margaret Sanger wasn't just saying, like, you need to be a mother on your own terms. She was also arguing for birth control as a means of women's sexual pleasure - like, sex can be recreational, not just procreation. And the feminists were like: OK, that's a bridge too far for us. These first-wave feminists were not with her. They didn't support her. And she got some overtures from the eugenics movement, which is really sort of picking up and really became thick and quite influential in the United States in the 1920s.\n\nAnd they had this imprimatur of science. Eugenics was a science. Harvard University had eugenisis on the faculty of the University of Virginia where I graduated from, also was a hotbed of eugenics theory and quote-unquote science. And so it was an actual movement with real influence and heft and they were making overtures to her and she accepted them.\n\nNow, to be very clear, the eugenics movement is deeply, deeply racist, right?\n\nJS: Yes.\n\nMM: Maybe Margaret Sanger is deeply, deeply racist. But not in the ways, I think, Justice Thomas thinks. Justice Thomas argues that her work with the eugenicist is about deracination; that they have purposely geared up to site birth control clinics in African-American communities for the purpose of stamping out Black reproduction and limiting Black political participation. That's not actually true.\n\nMargaret Sanger cites birth controls clinics in Harlem and in other African-American neighborhoods at the behest of the Black community. She's working with W.E.B. Dubois, who believes that as the Great Migration is beginning and African Americans are leaving the South, and leaving the vestiges of slavery and tenant farming for the North and industry, they can't have the big families that they once had, it's going to be a burden on them. And so he wants them to have access to family planning. He wants them to plan for smaller families. And he works with Margaret Sanger to introduce family planning to the Black community. So this isn't something that's foisted upon Black people; at least some parts of the Black community are viewing this as a way to shore up the economic fortunes and long-term prospects of this community that has been quite beleaguered.That's not enough for Justice Thomas, though. He never, ever mentioned this. He just talks about the siting of these birth control clinics in Harlem.\n\nThe other thing that's worth noting, though, about the racial dynamics of this moment, is that eugenesists are, as I say, deeply racist, but not in the way you would expect. They are interested in eugenics for the purpose of purifying and optimizing the white race.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And so their interests and their attention isn't necessarily focused on Black people, or even non-white people. It's really focused on maintaining whiteness.\n\nAnd so, for example, in 1927, the Supreme Court takes up a case called Buck v. Bell, which Justice Thomas does reference. And it is a case in which the State of Virginia has sterilized a young white woman who is poor, who is believed to be cognitively deficient, and who has already had a child out of wedlock. So she's basically failed to perform whiteness in three different ways. She's poor, she's under-educated, she's pregnant outside of marriage. And the court, in a decision that is infamous, says, \"three generations of imbeciles are enough\" and permits her sterilization. That's interesting because eugenicists didn't really put Black people in these colonies to be sterilized; they weren't interested in feeble-minded people of other races. They were literally interested in making sure that white people who had the wrong genes didn't transmit those wrong genes to future white populations, so they're about optimizing whiteness by making sure only the best of those that race actually reproduce. And so their principal technology of reproductive control is sterilization. And it's primarily directed at white women, poor white women.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: So Justice Thomas invokes this history of eugenics, but kind of misses the plot. They're not concerned about abortion.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: In fact, to the extent they are interested in abortion, they want to stop abortion because white women are contracepting and terminating pregnancies in order to keep their families a manageable size. And instead, what the eugenicists want is for native-born white women to have more children, so that whiteness doesn't get overwhelmed by these immigrants who are coming in. And their interests: eugenicists are deeply involved in immigration policy.\n\nJS: Right. I was gonna say they're deeply anti-immigrant. [Laughs.]\n\nMM: Yeah, that's where their interests are. They're not focused on Black people. And so he misses that entirely. And if he really wanted to sort of delve into Blackness and race and reproductive control, he could have just waited until the 1960s where many states have maintained their sterilization programs and now deploy them against poor women of color who are in receipt of public assistance. They make sterilization a condition of continued receipt of public assistance benefits, but he completely elides all of that, to make this kind of fakakta argument that abortion is a tool of eugenics.\n\nAnd, as you say, there's so many reasons why this is wrong. An individual exercising the right to abortion is not the same as the eugenics movement trying to optimize whiteness, and to embed white supremacy, like it's very, very different. But he completely elides these differences for an argument that's attractive and has flourished in the lower federal courts among many of his former clerks who are now judges, but really is divorced from the actual history and divorced from the voices of Black women during the 1960s, who were arguing that they wanted access to family planning, because they wanted not only economic and educational opportunity, but if the Black Power movement was going to succeed, it could not be a movement entirely of men with them staying home to care for the children.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And if you want it to talk about genocide, and injustice, as some members of the Black Power movement were, you really needed to talk about the poor conditions in which Black women were forced to raise their children or the Black women who were dying from illegal abortions or because of the absence of contraception or the absence of access to health care in those communities. So it elides a lot of things and especially Black women's voices.\n\nSo those are the first two things. I've gone on long, but I'm going to clean it up right now.\n\nJS: OK! [Laughs.]\n\nMM: The last thing, why is this here? So in footnote 41, Justice Alito nods to this history of eugenics. It's very much a love letter to Justice Thomas. Why does he do it? Is it just merely collegiality, like: I'm going to do Clarence a solid and put this in here? Because he doesn't need to. He's already overruled Roe v. Wade on entirely different grounds. There's no need to talk about this eugenics frame.\n\nI think the real reason that it is in here is because, as I've pointed out in my writing, it's not a great argument for abortion, because the histories are so different, and distinct, and you can easily put point out the fallacies in it. It is, I think, a better discussion, if you link this solely to the history of contraception, because Margaret Sanger was working with the eugenics movement, and if the idea here is to recast abortion, and contraception, from being tools of women's autonomy, and liberty and equality into being tools of racial injustice, the argument probably works better and is easier to make with contraception. So I wonder if this footnote is kind of a breadcrumb or a tiny bandanna around a tree branch to come back to later when they're ready to start challenging contraception and access to contraception.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: I want to get to one thing, just back to what you were saying about the ways in which which Black women were having to raise their families and all these things, and like conditions around these things being really important because I think the truth is that even after Roe, right, people with resources will still be able to get abortions. Like, duh, right?\n\nBut that the problem with Roe was in part that it was always, for so many people, just a right on paper. So let's just talk for a couple minutes about how Roe and then Planned Parenthood v Casey, which mostly reaffirmed Roe never actually conferred an actionable right for many, and then how that sort of proliferation of statewide restrictions just kind of pushed people farther from access, and about really who this has most impacted, right? So, yeah. [Laughs.] That makes sense!\n\nMM: It does. So the right secured in Roe is quite interesting. And this is also worth noting row was not the only abortion rights case percolating when the court was sort of taking this up.\n\nIn the 1970s - the early 1970s, late 1960s - there were a lot of different cases, including one from New York state called Hall v. Lefkowitz that was brought by feminist lawyers. And they were making the argument that New York's abortion law, which made it very hard for women to get abortions in New York, not only violated the right to privacy, that was something that had happened a few years earlier, in a case called Griswold v. Connecticut, it not only violated the right to privacy, it also was a question of sex equality, and race equality, and class equality. And they talked about how women of color bore the burden of these bans, and they were the most at risk for being killed if they sought legal abortions, they had the least amount of access to medical care all of this. They also argued that it was an Eighth Amendment violation, like to bear a child, because the state forced you to was a cruel and unusual punishment. So, I mean, they're making all kinds of arguments. They're going to see whatever sticks.\n\nInterestingly, that case and another case led by another set of feminist lawyers, does not make it to the court in time. The Lefkowitz case is meted out when New York State repeals its abortion law and puts in place a more liberal law that provides greater access to abortion. So that gets thrown out and it doesn't go up to the court. There's another case called Struck v. Secretary of Defense, which was a challenge brought by a female Air Force captain, Susan Struck, who found herself pregnant out of marriage while serving in the Air Force in Vietnam. And it was the federal government's policy at this time that if you were a female service person, and you found yourself pregnant, you either had to get an abortion or you had to leave military service. And Susan Struck did not want to give up her job. She also didn't want to have an abortion because she was a Catholic.\n\nSo Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who litigated this case on Capt. Struck's behalf, argued that there were religious liberty questions here, that this was pregnancy discrimination, this was an employment discrimination issue, in addition to being a privacy case, a sex equality case, all of these things. And so I just want to emphasize: There were lots of different frames around which to think about reproductive rights. And Ginsberg thought the Struck case was the perfect vehicle to go up to the court because it showed: This wasn't just about avoiding motherhood, it was about choosing motherhood on your terms.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And that case also gets muted because the federal government changes its policy to allow women to remain in military service even when they're pregnant.\n\nSo it's Roe. That's sort of the last man standing, and gets to the court. And it's actually argued by two women, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who are fresh out of law school. [Laughs.]\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: And they're 25 years old or thereabout. And they focus on the right to privacy, in part because it has actually been a very winning argument in the lower courts in Texas at that point. There had been a challenge to a Texas sodomy law that had been struck down on privacy grounds. And so it makes sense for them. But they aren't making the multifarious claims that these other lawyers are making in these other litigations.\n\nAnd when it gets to the court, Roe has already cabined to the right to privacy. The court could have expanded it, perhaps, but they focused solely on the right to privacy, and that has really been framed as a kind of a negative right; the right to prevent the government from making this decision for you. But there is no ancillary or concomitant obligation of the government to furnish the conditions under which you exercise the right, like a positive right.\n\nJS: Right. Right. Exactly.\n\nMM: So it's not just that the 15th Amendment can provide you with the right to vote - like, you actually have to have elections, right?\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: That's not the case with abortion. Like, yeah, you have a right to an abortion. But what if you can't access it, what if you don't have the money, what if you live far away? Who cares?\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And in the 1980s, there was a case called Harris v. McRae, which is a challenge to the Hyde Amendment and the Hyde Amendment is an appropriations rider that has gotten tapped on to almost every session of appropriations bills in the House, and has gone through Congress and been approved many, many times. But it basically prohibits the use of federal funds for abortion with some limited exceptions. And the Hyde Amendment, it was argued, would have a disparate impact on women of color, on Black women, on poor women. And the court was kind of like: Yeah, that's probably true.\n\nAnd they just said Roe v. Wade gives you an a right to an abortion, but it doesn't give you a right to government subsidy of your abortion. And that is really a pivotal moment in the court's abortion jurisprudence because it is a right, as you say, on paper for the millions of people who lack the resources to actually access this or who are too far away or who live in a state where there is now a single abortion clinic, like Mississippi.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: So that's kind of where you are. And you're exactly right. The women who bear the brunt of this are indigenous women, young women, undocumented women, women of color, poor women. And that's a problem.\n\nJS: And I think you're right. I mean, I think it's really good, actually; I hadn't even thought about this in that way as a negative right, like this limiting thing. Because then Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania comes along, and in a way kind of doubles down on that, which then allows all these additional restrictions state by state by state that then, again, access? Whatever!\n\nIt's never been a priority. And, in fact, what the court has done is make it just more difficult and more difficult, so that these same populations just keep getting pushed further and further to the margins and not able to access those rights.\n\nMM: So yes, and no, right?\n\nJS: OK.\n\nMM: So Planned Parenthood [of Southeastern Pennsylvania] v. Casey does a lot of things. It does really trim back Roe v. Wade in a lot of ways even as it quote-unquote saves Roe. So you lose by winning with Planned Parenthood [of Southeastern Pennsylvania] v. Casey, because it does save the abortion right. But it also gives the state wider latitude to restrict access to abortion.\n\nBut one of the things that Casey does that I think doesn't get quite a lot of airtime is that it rectifies a problem that Roe had that really was just a problem of timing. The Supreme Court takes up Roe in 1973. That's right at the moment where the court is reading the 14th Amendment to finally include women. Women, as I said before, are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. The Constitution says nothing about women.\n\nThrough Ruth Bader Ginsburg's efforts and the efforts of other pioneering women lawyers, the 1970s becomes this moment where they are pressing the court to interpret the 14th Amendment in a way that reaches questions of sex discrimination and gender discrimination. And so Roe comes at the same moment as we're getting all of these cases that are about whether the state can make distinctions on the basis of gender. And so, the fact that they are contemporaneous means that the court's abortion jurisprudence isn't really nourished or cross-fertilized, interestingly enough by what is happening in the sex discrimination-realm, right. So Roe is a privacy case, it doesn't really think about sex equality in a very thick way.\n\nAnd it's also a case decided by nine men.\n\nJS: [Laughs.] Right.\n\nMM: Planned Parenthood [of Southeastern Pennsylvania] v. Casey is a 1992 decision. And so we've had almost 20 years, at this point, of women being part of constitutional law, like literally being part of constitutional law, and the court having a framework and a vernacular for thinking about what it means to discriminate on the basis of sex and gender. And so Casey, even as it limits Roe, even as it expands the power of the state to restrict abortion, it also talks about abortion in radically different terms than Roe did. And it talks about it as a vehicle of women's equality, it talks about the idea - and this, I think, is also a function of the court now having a woman on it.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: So, Sandra Day O'Connor is part of the plurality in Casey. And I actually think she probably wrote this part. She talks about the women of this country coming to rely on abortion, planning their lives around the prospect that this exists if something goes wrong. And it has been a vehicle for women to make their way in this society, and it's necessary for them to be understood as equal citizens. This idea of controlling your own reproductive capacity is fundamental to the prospect of women's equal citizenship.\n\nYou don't get that in Roe. You do get that in Casey. And it's not surprising; you've got 20 years to sort of let this jurisprudence of sex discrimination steep.\n\n[Meditative musical interlude.]\n\nJS: I want to get to one really important thing, which is that Alito tries to silo abortion rights as the only thing on the chopping block here, but I don't understand how you can see it that way.\n\nCan you explain why that isn't necessarily the case and what additional rights may be threatened?\n\nMM: So this is gaslighting, pure and simple. And I will just say there are a number of male pundits who, I think, over the last week have said like me and other women who have said that this is clearly not the case, our hysterical lady parts are getting the better of us.\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: OK, I'm happy to be Cassandra destined to know the truth and not be believed. Because it doesn't make any sense that abortion can be sequestered from these other rights: same-sex marriage, contraception, interracial marriage, because if the problem with abortion rights - and Justice Alito is very clear about what the problems are - they are unenumerated, they're atextual, they're ahistorical. So are all of these other things.\n\nNothing in the Constitution speaks of marriage. Nothing in the Constitution speaks of same-sex marriage. Nothing in the Constitution speaks of interracial marriage. The Constitution says nothing about Ortho Tri-Cyclen and birth control.\n\nJS: [Laughs.] Right.\n\nMM: Nor is there a historical tradition, right? Contraception was criminalized in many states until the Supreme Court invalidated that in 1965. Same-sex Marriage was not permitted in most jurisdictions until the 2000s. And interracial marriage was banned in many jurisdictions well until 1967, when Loving v. Virginia was decided. So the idea that abortion is unique, abortion is distinctive, and it is distinctive because it involves the destruction of a potential human: OK, but nothing in the logic of this opinion allows for us to meaningfully sequester the prospect of invalidating rights to abortion from the prospect of invalidating rights to all of these other things.\n\nAnd all you have to do to see the writing on the wall is listen to the Republicans. At Ketanji Brown Jackon's hearing, Sen. Marsha Blackburn was like: Do you agree with Griswold v. Connecticut? Griswold is the 1965 decision that permitted adults who are married to use contraception in their marriage. She was suggesting it was wrongly decided.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, the senior senator from Texas, was asking Judge Jackson about her views of Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana suggested that interracial marriage should be left to the states - and then he tried to walk it back, but not that much.\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: I mean, they're showing you where they're going. I mean, I don't know why you take Justice Alito, the angriest man on the court, at his word here. The only thing that will stop them is what they think they can get away with.\n\nJS: Exactly. And so this kind of comes back to Marsha Blackburn, to this idea that they're speaking these things out loud, you just got to take them at their face value: like, when they tell you who they are, believe them. Because I just want to see what you think, the next battle lines. Especially regarding reproductive freedom and maybe beyond.\n\nI see fetal personhood and resulting criminalization, but also definitely attacking various forms of birth control, and thinking like IUDs, plan B in particular. And kind of jumping onto your footnote thing, I think that some of these things I'm concerned about are precisely because of some of the positions that the court or its members have taken in the past. So I'm curious what you see ahead, and are there any clues and other Supreme Court opinions about how these might play out within a new landscape?\n\nMM: Let me first say that any changes don't necessarily have to be immediate. Remember, it took almost 50 years to overrule Roe v. Wade. So they're skilled at playing a long game. And I think you could see that. And I think that might be the case for same-sex marriage, for example. It is something that enjoys a great deal of popularity right now. And withdrawing those rights could definitely be politically problematic.\n\nBut we've also seen a rising effort and the proliferation of accommodations for religious objectors to same-sex marriage. And it might be the case that we just continue to bless the prospect of religious objections. And once you've actually normalized the idea that you can treat same-sex couples differently in the public marketplace, you do that for 20 years, and it's not that hard to imagine curtailing the rights more substantially.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: Right. So, this could be a longer game. Contraception, I think, is a more immediate prospect, in part because we've already seen the groundwork being laid for that in the objections to the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo in 2014, there was a case called Burwell v. Hobby Lobby [Stores, Inc.], which involved a challenge to the contraceptive mandate that was brought by a family-owned corporation Hobby Lobby, that not only sold stencils, but also harbored real objections to certain forms of contraception - [laughs]\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: - including IUDs, emergency contraception, and some other forms of long-acting contraception. And the reason why they objected to these forms of contraception and providing them to their employees as part of the Affordable Care Act's mandate was because they viewed them as quote-unquote abortifacient and the \"science\" here, and I'm saying \"science\" in quotation marks, is that they argued that these forms of contraception prevented the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine wall, and therefore they were tantamount to an abortion. Right?\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: So I just want to say for everyone who has followed me on Twitter and has blamed me for not knowing science. I'm just reporting this. I don't believe this. I know this is not science. But this is the argument that was made - and it is scientifically unsound. That actually is not how IUDs work. It's not how emergency contraception works.\n\nJS: Exactly. There's science and there's junk science, and it's deployed freely in the reproductive space. Go back to eugenics and now their take on IUDs, and plan B, and stuff like that. So absolutely: science is real, junk science is junk.\n\nMM: But junk science shows up at the Supreme Court.\n\nJS: Yes! Yes!\n\nMM: And in the Hobby Lobby opinion, Justice Alito, who wrote that opinion crediting this argument and ruling for Hobby Lobby, doesn't really do anything to dispel the idea that an IUD is an abortifacient. And so that lives in a Supreme Court opinion.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: And once you've sort of had the imprimatur of the court, sort of blessing this idea that an IUD is a mini-abortion, you can continue from there. And so I think we're already beginning to see that.\n\nSo Louisiana has a law that has been proposed that would essentially make abortion a homicide, but also includes, as an abortion, the prospect of IUDs and emergency contraception, the question is whether or not those are considered abortions because they are quote-unquote abortifacients. And so that, I think, is the whole game, like: What is an abortion? And once you sort of expansively define what it is to be an abortion, what it means to perform an abortion, then I think it's a much easier road for banning certain forms of contraception. And once you normalize that you can't expect access to certain forms of contraception, again, I think it becomes easier to limit other forms of contraception.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: You did this \"Why Abortion Is Essential to Democracy\" event with the Brennan Center, where you were speaking to this idea that this is what broken democracy looks like, that kind of regardless what the court rules here, that being at this point, right, where we are, kind of shows how democracy has been damaged.\n\nAnd you talked a bit about Texas' S.B. 8 as part of that. So I'm wondering if you can go ahead and maybe explain what you mean about broken or disrupted democracy? And then, while doing so, maybe offer a brief description of the Texas law to just remind people what's going on there?\n\nMM: Sure.\n\nSo we often think of voting rights and reproductive rights in two different silos, and they don't overlap at all. And I think we have siloed them to our detriment, because they are really very much inextricably intertwined. And I mean that to say that the law enforced in Texas right now, S.B. 8, which is a patently unconstitutional law that the Supreme Court has allowed to continue to be enforced in Texas for months now, it's patently unconstitutional, but it's also the product of a democratic failure in that state.\n\nSo that is a state that has been gerrymandered beyond recognition at the district level. And it's allowed for not just a red legislature - I mean Texas is a red state, but it has pockets of blue. But a lot of those blue pockets have been rejiggered so that they are smaller and therefore less influential in the political process, less influential in the state legislative process, and it is allowed the legislature to be decisively red, decisively conservative. It's extreme gerrymandering. And that's basically how you get a law that's as extreme as S.B. 8.\n\nThis is going on all over the country, right? And the Supreme Court, interestingly, has said in an opinion from 2019, that there is no role for the federal courts in dealing with partisan gerrymandering; that's something the states have to decide. Which honestly is like your house got burgled and you turn to the burglar to return all the stuff. Like: The states are doing this. Why would they stop? Right?\n\nSo the court has left it to the states to fix the problem the states have created. So, terrific. That's one aspect of it.\n\nAnd then, the court itself has also dismantled the opportunity for individuals to register their discontent at the ballot box because they've dismantled the preclearance process of the Voting Rights Act and made it easier for states to pass laws that actually suppress the vote. So you know, here are our choices. We can either prevent these laws from getting passed - harder to do if you live in one of these states that's been gerrymandered beyond recognition, and then you can sort of protest. That's harder to do if your vote isn't being counted, if it's harder to vote, and essentially, you've got a court that has made it so hard to participate in democracy - and this also has the ancillary benefit of shielding the court. Like, when they do actually overrule Roe vs. Wade this summer, how are we supposed to register our discontent?\n\nI mean, this is the thing that's so funny right now. People are all up in arms because people are silently protesting Justice Kavanaugh's house. Like, you've dismantled all of the acceptable means of protesting that are legitimate, like voting! What are people to do? You've got a wall around the Supreme Court, where should they go? It's not surprising that they have gone to your house, the only thing that is surprising is that your neighbors are facilitating it.\n\nJS: [Laughs.] Exactly. And this is where I want to try to transform that into - perhaps, can we find a glimmer of hope here?\n\nWhich is that, for me, even before the opinion leaks, I've been talking to providers, advocates, activists, and they obviously were all pretty clear this was coming, too. But they were like: OK, look, when Roe falls, we have an opportunity, though it may take awhile, to build something new. But that it's going to take people joining forces, that you have to come from a full sort of social and reproductive justice framework, and that we have to support each other, that we have to understand that all our rights intersect, which of course gets me to thinking about what you were saying about the other challenges that had been brought to get at the abortion, right, in the cases that finally didn't get there - that kind of looked at this situation more broadly.\n\nSo I'm wondering: What do you think is the thing that we can do knowing what's out there. What do we need to do to try to reassert our voices and to try to get this tanker ship to turn back on course?\n\nMM: So, one: I know a lot of people are just like, voting is terrible. Nothing ever happens. We haven't been able to secure protections for voting rights in the Senate.\n\nI want to just be like a complete older person about this.\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: We have to vote. We have to take the midterm elections seriously.\n\nOne of the reasons we haven't been able to do all of these things that people want is because the Senate is exactly 50-50. If we had a more decisive majority in the Senate so much more would be possible.\n\nI mean just even think about the judges that could be appointed. Justice Jackson is amazing. Again, genetically modified in a lab for this moment. But she was also selected because she was so impeccable, so fantastic, and did not have a record on abortion cases. Like nothing that could really be assailable or could be just leapt on by the Republicans, and they still came for her. Right?\n\nJS: Yeah. Mhmm. In the most tacky and disingenuous - oh, it was horrible are the nicest things I think I could say. Yeah.\n\nMM: But imagine if there was a more decisive majority in the Senate. If the Democrats had a more decisive majority.\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nMM: You might be able to get someone who had actually written about abortion and had been very clear. Someone like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I mean, we're living in a time where Ruth Bader Ginsburg could not have been appointed to the court from the Senate. Because she has done things like advocate for women's equality: what could we do if we actually were able to channel our voices through the democratic process. Like, when you talk about elections, it's clear that there are lots of people who care about different issues, and they're not voting. They don't think their vote matters. They don't think it counts. They think the system is rigged. What if those people just, on a whim, were like: I'm going to vote in this one. I'm going to vote with this progressive majority. I'm gonna make my voice heard because this moment is too important. We could make gains.\n\nJS: Right.\n\nMM: We could stop partisan gerrymandering. We could be heard. You could turn Texas blue. Look at those 5,000 people who turned out with three days notice in Houston to hear Beto O'Rourke.\n\nJS: Yeah. Yeah!\n\nMM: Like, Texas is a purple state for some purposes.\n\nJS: Oh, yeah, absolutely. [Laughs.]\n\nMM: What could we do if we actually took this moment seriously?\n\nAnd so I'm so excited to see all of the agitation and how exercised people are about this. Keep this energy to November. I think one of the things this leak was designed to do is to get people all aflutter right now. And then by the time they actually do release an opinion in June, we're sort of like: Yeah, we knew that was coming. Or if it's not a complete disaster, and it's not as extreme as Justice Alito's draft opinion, we actually think it's a victory when it's not. We have to be as mad in June and in November as we were on the Monday night that draft decision got announced.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: Melissa Murray is the Frederick I. and Grace Stokes Professor of Law at New York University, and the co-host of an excellent podcast about the Supreme Court, Strict Scrutiny.\n\nProfessor Murray, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nMM: Thank you for having me.

      "text": "More People Will Die\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Supreme Court is taking away a fundamental bodily right - and condemning pregnant people to financial suffering and possible death.\n\nA pro-abortion supporter cries outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on June 24, 2022.\n\nIn a stunning, if expected, ruling, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, ignoring decades of precedent to deny Americans a fundamental human right. The decision cleared the way for states to outlaw abortion and criminalize those who seek one or help others get them.\n\nThe ruling will quickly make abortion illegal in several states. Thirteen - Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming - have so-called trigger laws on the books meant to make abortion illegal in the event that Roe fell. Texas and Missouri declared abortion illegal within hours of the ruling. Others still have restrictions in place that can now be revived.\n\nHere's a stark truth that's crucial to keep in mind: More pregnant people in those states will die.\n\nMedication abortion is safe and effective , but states have already been working to restrict it. In desperation, many pregnant people in states that ban abortion will still do what they can to obtain one. Abortion won't disappear, but for many it will become deadly. Even people experiencing pregnancy complications will get caught up and have their lives threatened if doctors refuse to give them the treatment they need, as has happened in countries like Ireland and Poland .\n\nThose who aren't able to get the abortion they want, need, and deserve will see their lives irreparably damaged.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOne researcher's estimate is that a quarter of those who would have sought and previously been able to get an abortion will instead give birth. They will watch as their life's dreams slip away. Forced birth will lead to diminished economic prospects and severe destitution for parents and their children.\n\nIn the seminal Turnaway Study of women who sought an abortion, despite comparable financial footing, those who were unsuccessful in getting an abortion were three times as likely to wind up living in poverty than those who were successful. They were also more likely to end up unemployed. Years later, people who can't obtain abortions wind up with more debt and are more likely to have gone bankrupt or been evicted.\n\nChildren will suffer too. Legal abortion reduced the number of children living in poverty and improved children's lives by making it more likely they would graduate college and earn enough to live on. Growing up in poverty, on the other hand, has huge negative effects on children's education, involvement in the criminal justice system, and lifelong earnings and job potential.\n\nIt's also far more difficult to parent while living in poverty and after carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. The Turnaway Study found that the mothers who didn't get abortions reported worse emotional bonding with the children they were forced to bear. Other research has found that legalizing abortion reduced instances of child abuse and neglect.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nAccess to legal abortion, on the other hand, has, until this point, dramatically changed American women's economic opportunities. Women who get the abortions they seek are more likely to be able to follow through on their plans for education and careers.\n\nThe legalization of abortion after the original Roe decision better enabled women to get higher levels of education, increased their participation in the labor force, boosted their earnings, and upped their \"occupational prestige,\" in the words of two economists.\n\nThe reasons behind those trends aren't hard to follow. Being a parent is difficult and expensive, especially in this country. Pregnancy itself is frequently penalized at work. Very few workers are offered paid family leave when their children are born, and there is no guarantee they'll get paid sick leave when their children fall ill. The cost of child care has risen dramatically in recent decades, and that's for parents who don't live in a child care desert and can actually find a spot. Very few children are enrolled in public preschool.\n\nMothers in particular often fall subject to the motherhood penalty that sees them as less dedicated and competent workers and damages their pay relative to women without children and fathers - just when they need more income to support a family. One paper found that \"children impose significantly larger penalties on the career trajectories of women relative to men.\"\n\nThese outcomes will only be magnified for unwanted pregnancies and forced births.\n\nThe ability to control pregnancy and one's own body is a bedrock right that Americans deserve regardless of the economic outcomes. But it is also true that, as well as denying pregnant people in this country a fundamental bodily right, the Supreme Court and the states that ban abortion are condemning them to financial suffering and possible death.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Democrats' Cowardice and Complicity in the Post-Roe World\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe liberal establishment refuses to take any sort of risk in the service of women's and other pregnant people's lives.\n\nXavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, speaks during a news conference about an action plan in response to the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 2022.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that the Biden administration and Democratic leadership in Congress are doing hardly anything to protect reproductive rights following the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nSpeaking on \"Meet the Press\" this Sunday, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra made clear that his agency had little interest in exploring ways to use federal powers to ensure abortions remain available in states that have banned the procedure.\n\n\"Unless we're all going to say the word of the Supreme Court will no longer have value, we have to heed the word of the Supreme Court,\" Becerra said, before dismissing the suggestion - supported by a number of left-wing Democrats and rejected by the White House - of using federal lands to provide abortion services in states with bans.\n\nThis unbound deference to the moribund institution of the Supreme Court - paired with a cowardly refusal to take any sort of risk in the service of women's and other pregnant people's lives - is typical of the mainstream liberal response to the end of Roe. On the Sunday talk show, Becerra rejected the centrist host's suggestion to place temporary clinics on federal lands and force the courts to decide. Instead, the administration is throwing up its hands without even trying.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate how badly Democrats dropped the ball on preventing Roe from being endangered and then preparing for it to be overturned. The world after Roe, though, is showing the liberal establishment's cowardice and complicity when it comes to getting access to abortions for people who need them. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reading an Israeli poem to the repeated entreaties to vote harder, the utter failure is staggering.\n\nDemocrats in government are not the only ones whose scant resistance will ensure that the Christo-fascists can enforce their post-Roe reality. Numerous health care providers and nonprofit organizations - most notably Planned Parenthood - are acting with preemptive zeal to remove reproductive and other health care services, even while legal gray areas abound.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a group that does much good work but also exists firmly within the reluctant liberal establishment, has shown a lack of fortitude since the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision took down Roe last month. Planned Parenthood of Montana will no longer provide medication abortions for patients from South Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma and will now require proof of residency for the treatment.\n\n\"The risks around cross-state provision of services are currently less than clear, with the potential for both civil and criminal action for providing abortions in states with bans,\" wrote Montana Planned Parenthood CEO and President Martha Fuller in an internal email to her staff, which was obtained by the Daily Beast. \"As we move forward, and learn more about risks, we will be offering guidance and implementing any necessary changes in policies and procedures for abortion care.\"\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Southwest Fort Worth Health Center in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 3, 2022.\n\nFuller is correct that the end of Roe brings about a new battleground of interstate juridical conflict : Republican-led statehouses are trying to find ways to prosecute out-of-state abortion providers. Numerous blue states are, thankfully, passing laws to combat this in turn. None of it is settled, and it remains legal for Planned Parenthood of Montana, where abortion is legal, to provide abortion pills to patients from out of state. Fuller even noted that surgical abortions would remain available for patients from any state.\n\nContinuing to provide medical abortions for all should be the very least a well-funded institution could do. Instead, in the name of litigiousness, Planned Parenthood handed yet another victory to the pro-natalist far right .\n\nIn Missouri, meanwhile, St. Luke's Health System, which operates 17 hospitals, pharmacies, and urgent care clinics in Kansas City, responded to the fall of Roe by immediately ending the provision of Plan B emergency contraception pills.\n\nWithin a day, however, the major health system reversed its decision. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson had clarified that the state's new abortion ban did not affect Plan B or similar products.\n\nThe health care provider's hair-trigger willingness to briefly stop providing Plan B remains chilling: a clear signal that as the GOP continues its fight to decimate all reproductive rights, including access to contraception, major hospital groups will follow in goose-step. In examples like St. Luke's, the hospitals and their lawyers have been at the vanguard of care removal - even before a law was on the books to coerce action.\n\nPolice look on as abortion rights demonstrators march past the house of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in Chevy Chase, Md., on June 29, 2022.\n\nIn the days since the Supreme Court's vile and long-predicted ruling, stories spread across social media of women who have been denied care, even care unrelated to ending a pregnancy.\n\nA Virginia woman with the autoimmune disease lupus tweeted that her doctor had stopped prescribing her medication, methotrexate, because it is considered an abortifacient: \"in less than one week i lost access to healthcare that i need because the drug could be used to induce abortions,\" she wrote. \"I live in Virginia and abortion is legal here. but it is not protected by law and individual providers and pharmacies can decide what they will and won't do re: abortifacients.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other stories are circulating of OB-GYNs in red states waiting to operate to end potentially deadly and always unviable ectopic pregnancies until the patient's life is in clear danger, so as to be in compliance with abortion bans' \"medical emergency\" exemptions.\n\nWhen Republicans designed abortion ban legislation to evade federal court challenges by relying instead on vigilante enforcement - like Texas's pernicious Senate Bill 8 - it was in the knowledge that health care providers would respond with litigious compliance. Under a privatized model of medical care, the bottom line will always trump a broader commitment to human health and flourishing.\n\nThat so many have given up on reproductive rights so swiftly, even those purportedly dedicated to reproductive health care, is a grim reminder that neither the medical nor the political establishment can be relied upon as allies in the struggle for a robust reproductive justice. It's hardly news: The U.S. medical system has long treated poor Black and brown women - who disproportionately suffer under abortion bans - as disposable.\n\nThankfully, while establishment Democrats, major nonprofits, and private health care groups act in timid compliance to fascist rule, sites of genuine resistance continue to grow. Collectives and individuals have long been committed to sharing information, support, resources , abortion pills , and services. They understand the need to navigate legal gray areas and work within, outside, and against violent laws.\n\nThose who continue to take risks to fight for reproductive justice make clear that real resistance is possible. They clarify, too, that those caving so readily to a fascist status quo are making a choice to stand on the wrong side of history.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Roe Is Dead. Long Live Roe?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe first state constitutional protection of reproductive rights hints at the contradictions and fears of a divided movement.\n\nActivists participate in a candlelight vigil on abortion rights in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 13, 2021, in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, 26 states are \"certain or likely to ban abortion,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute . In December, the court heard arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , addressing Mississippi's Gestational Age Act banning abortion after 15 weeks' pregnancy. The law is a deliberate violation of Roe, the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion. Most observers expect the conservative majority to rule in Mississippi's favor. In that case abortion law would revert to the states, where in vast red swaths of this nation it has been so slashed and shredded that it's already practically confetti.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 states are doing what they can to rescue the legal right to abortion. Twelve are crafting legislation, like New York's Reproductive Health Act, that reaffirms in statute the court's ruling in Roe. Three, and the District of Columbia, are moving beyond Roe: codifying a right to abortion throughout pregnancy without state interference. And one state, Vermont, is doing a little of both: proposing a state constitutional amendment that enshrines individual reproductive liberty as a basic right - and then hedging, suggesting that it may not be that basic after all.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThese varying approaches show that the reproductive justice movement is divided not just about how to shelter legal abortion in its last redoubts now, but also how to win it back for all and for good. Before Roe, the question was: Reform abortion laws or repeal them altogether? Today that translates to: Hang onto a tattered Roe or scrap it and start anew? Vermont's hybrid - or self-contradictory - strategy may hint of both a realization and a fear. Roe is probably a dead letter. But it is still a letter, something to hold onto. The movement's confidence may be as tattered as the right it's trying to defend.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nWhat is wrong with Roe? A lot. First, it's based on the right of privacy established in Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 ruling affirming a married couple's freedom to use birth control. Many critics (including me) have argued that privacy - a young, relatively untested \"penumbral\" right not named in the Constitution but implied by other amendments - is a fragile support for the weighty human right of reproductive autonomy. Why not, say, the 13th Amendment's prohibition on involuntary servitude, the use of one's body against one's will?\n\nThe second weakness is the framework the court set up in Roe, which shifts the balance of the state's interest from the pregnant person's rights as independent actor (and the fetus as part of the pregnant person) in early gestation to the fetus's potential life as it matures toward viability: the point at which a baby can survive outside the womb, now about 24 weeks. A decade after Roe, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor alerted her colleagues that science was pushing viability earlier and earlier in gestation, progressively shaving weeks off the mother's liberty; Roe, she said , was \"on a collision course with itself.\" And indeed, hardly an instant later, abortion opponents started revving the engines to accelerate that collision, promoting the myths - and passing laws based on them - that a fetus can feel pain during abortion or survive on its own at the first indication of a \"fetal heartbeat\" less than six weeks after conception. During oral arguments in Dobbs, Chief Justice John Roberts showed eagerness to eliminate the viability standard altogether, in effect cutting the brake line that keeps Roe from crashing.\n\nThe third flaw in the past 40-some years of legally defending Roe is the test O'Connor proposed as more enduring than viability: that the law impose no \"undue burden\" on the ability to get or provide an abortion. Undue burden is even feebler than privacy. At this point, there may be no burden SCOTUS's conservatives consider undue: not driving thousands of miles , not having an ultrasound probe shoved up your vagina for no reason , not paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket . Apparently, no emotional burden is undue either. During the Dobbs colloquy, Trump appointee Justice Amy Coney Barrett brought up \"safe haven laws,\" which allow people to leave an unwanted newborn at a hospital or fire station anonymously and without criminal liability. Wouldn't these provisions \"take care of [the] problem\" of forced parenthood, Barrett mused. Julie Rikelman, attorney for the abortion provider, responded that the issue at hand was forced pregnancy, which \"imposes unique physical demands and risk on women and in fact has impact\" on their families and livelihoods. Court etiquette inhibited Rikelman from voicing what was likely on her mind: \"And which of your seven children would you put in a basket and float down the Nile, Your Honor ?\"\n\nVermont's Reproductive Liberty Amendment aims to overcome these weaknesses. Introduced in 2019, the amendment easily passed the state Legislature, the mandated second time, this session. If the electorate votes yes on Proposition 5 on the November ballot, it will become part of the Vermont Constitution the next day. This is what it says:\n\nThat an individual's right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one's own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.\n\nAt its most basic, the amendment makes permanent \"conditions on the ground,\" Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint, a co-sponsor and active champion of the bill, told me. This is a good thing, because at present Vermont's policies are exemplary. The state requires no parental involvement in a minor's decision to end a pregnancy, for instance, and compels Medicaid and private insurance to cover abortion and birth control. Healthy majorities support reproductive justice. The amendment passed the House by a vote of 107 to 41. Seven in 10 Vermont adults favor the right to abortion in most cases.\n\nIn this sense, the amendment might be more symbolic than practical. Still, as the first in the nation, the text serves as a signpost for other states. The problem: It's hard to know which direction the signpost is pointing.\n\nThe first part, up to and including \"shall not be denied or infringed,\" is radical. It asserts that the roughly half of humans who bear uteruses are free to do with their bodies as they wish, period. The second half telegraphs second thoughts. The phrase \"unless justified by a compelling state interest\" hints that there might be legitimate and compelling justification to violate the fundamental right the state just finished declaring.\n\nWhat compelling interest might Vermont have to violate the human right to bodily autonomy? This is not a theoretical question. All sorts of arbitrary and burdensome restrictions on abortion claim a compelling state interest. \"Whereas the State of Florida has a compelling interest from the outset of a woman's pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child,\" and \"the pregnant woman has a compelling interest in knowing the likelihood of her unborn child surviving to full-term birth based upon the presence of cardiac activity,\" reads Florida's Heartbeat Act , language that is nearly identical to other fetal heartbeat laws, including Texas's , which effectively ban abortion at six weeks. In defending its 15-week ban, Mississippi had the chutzpah - and the wit - to use Roe and other pro-choice precedents against themselves. \"The Supreme Court has long recognized ... an 'important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life,'\" it argued, quoting Roe. It went on to cite the state's \"interest in protecting the life of the unborn\" as well as its \"legitimate interests from the outset of pregnancy in protecting the health of women,\" both from Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed Roe in 1992.\n\nThe Vermont amendment's sponsors do not agree that its second clause kneecaps the first. The terms \"compelling state interest\" and \"least restrictive means,\" they note, echo the language of \"strict scrutiny,\" the highest level of judicial review. To be upheld as constitutional under this standard, a law must further a \"compelling governmental interest\" that cannot be achieved in any other way - and that way must be narrowly defined. One of the few triggers for strict scrutiny is the challenge that the legislation abridges a fundamental right.\n\nIf the \"unless\" clause is compromise language intended to win more votes, neither Balint nor the chief sponsor, Vermont Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chair Ginny Lyons, admitted as much. Both insist that Clause No. 2 only strengthens the fundamental right to reproductive liberty. \"Remember that the Roe v. Wade decision was based on something called privacy that doesn't exist in the Constitution,\" Lyons told me. \"What we've learned from that is to place reproductive autonomy in the broader context of the state constitution.\"\n\nArticle 1 of the Vermont Constitution proclaims: \"All persons are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights.\" Interestingly, also on Vermont's ballot this November is Proposition 2 , asking voters to ratify another amendment - no easy task in this state. Prop 2 repeals Article 1's second half, which abolished servitude or slavery, \"unless bound by the person's own consent\" or in payment of a debt. In its place would be the simple sentence \"Slavery and indentured servitude in any form are prohibited.\"\n\nAppending an asterisk to a human right is asking for trouble. Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit cruel and unusual punishment \" unless justified by a compelling state interest \"? Does the 19th proclaim, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex - unless justified by a compelling state interest \"? The one U.S. constitutional amendment with an exception written into it is the 13th, banning slavery and involuntary servitude \"except as a punishment for crime.\" As Michelle Alexander and other scholars argue, this loophole, inserted to gain ratification from Western states ambivalent about slavery, allowed the reincarnation of slavery in striped prison garb during Jim Crow and led to the mass incarceration of the descendants of enslaved people. What if Vermont's \"unless\" clause, intended to preempt violation, actually invited it?\n\nAt a meeting in the late 1960s, Cindy Cisler, a Redstockings co-founder and leading feminist organizer for repeal - not reform - of abortion laws, held up a blank piece of paper. \"This,\" she declared, \"should be the abortion law.\"\n\nNow that there's little left to lose, we might as well start over with what we really want. Replace the consumerist concept of reproductive choice with the principle of reproductive justice: not just the right to terminate a pregnancy but also to carry one healthily to term and raise the child in a safe and sustainable environment; not just the right to contraception but also the right to refuse it and to be free from forced sterilization or other eugenic coercions. Build this expansive definition of reproductive justice into the right to bodily autonomy. Elevate bodily autonomy in the U.S. to its global status, as an inalienable human right.\n\nThen we should demand what we need from the government when it comes to abortion law. That is, nothing .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The End of Roe: Saving Abortion Rights Means Taking Them Into Our Own Hands\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe relentless right and feckless Democrats brought us here. Now, preserving access to abortion will require breaking some laws.\n\nA police officer carries a barricade as demonstrators gather to protest a leaked draft opinion poised to strike down the right to abortion in the U.S. in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on May 3, 2022.\n\nFor months now, if not years, front-line abortion providers and advocates for access have been writing about the fall of Roe v. Wade as a \" when ,\" not an \"if.\" The end of Roe has already arrived in dozens of states where Republicans have forged a post-Roe reality by cutting off access to abortion and criminalizing its provision.\n\nYet the unprecedented leak Monday night of a Supreme Court draft opinion, signaling the final and unambiguous undoing of already weak constitutional abortion protections, curdles the blood even of those who saw it coming. More women and pregnant people will suffer and die; poor people of color will be affected in disproportionate numbers.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe blame lies squarely with the powerful Christian right, aided and abetted by cynical fascoid right-wingers, who have set their sights on pregnant people's bodily autonomy for decades. They will not respond to our rage and protests. They will push on with their authoritarian agenda. Despite claims to states' rights in the leaked opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, there is clear evidence that if Republicans retake Congress in November, they will seek to pass a federal abortion ban .\n\nThere is no reasoning with fascists. Our energies must go elsewhere: placing fierce and unwavering pressure on Democrats, spineless as they have been, to act on this issue while they still have some control of the legislature. It should never have come to this - the end of Roe with zero nationwide legislative protections for abortion access.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nDemocrats in Congress should have long ago codified the right to abortion access, as the party's left flank has urged , but they didn't. If they don't act now to end the filibuster and pass abortion protection laws, they will deserve something approaching the same level of blame directed at anti-abortion Republicans.\n\nAfter Texas passed an effective abortion ban last year, which was ruled unconstitutional by a state judge in December, President Joe Biden vowed to \"launch a whole-of-government effort\" to protect the right to abortion in the state. We are yet to see any such effort, even though, as I wrote at the time, there are a number of steps his administration could immediately take.\n\nIf - and this really is an if - the fear of a nationwide abortion ban and the shock of Roe's undoing galvanizes Democratic voters in November, these will once again be votes against a greater evil, rather than votes the Democrats have earned. Just as today's Democratic Party has refused to take the lead on this issue even as abortion access has fallen apart in so many places, they will not take the lead now. Instead, it is up to us - it always has been.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the draft opinion on overturning Roe v. Wade, photographed in Washington, D.C., on April 23, 2021.\n\nSince we cannot rely on Democratic leaders, we must - following the example of organizers on the front lines of this struggle - work around the law, exploiting the coming interstate jurisdictional chaos around abortion law that the end of Roe will bring into even sharper relief. The fight for free and accessible abortions has always required solidarity, risk, and cunning. To keep reproductive justice alive, we must fight on terrain beyond the law, in contravention of certain laws, or in post-Roe legal gray areas.\n\nThe end of Roe, as a forthcoming and crucial paper in the Columbia Law Review notes, will bring forth an entirely new battleground of interstate juridical conflict. States that support access rights will move to pass laws that protect abortion providers who treat out-of-state patients, while anti-abortion states will seek to pass laws to prosecute out-of-state providers.\n\nThis clashing bifurcation is already beginning to unfold: Legislators in Connecticut passed a bill last week designed to protect abortion providers who assist patients seeking refuge from abortion-ban states. Other blue states should follow this lead.\n\nMeanwhile, 26 states are ready with laws to enact abortion bans when Roe is undone and are passing ever more elaborate ways to criminalize abortions. Over a dozen of these states recently passed bans in their legislatures; other laws predate Roe but remain on the books and could snap back into effect. At present, only 16 states and Washington, D.C., have laws that actively protect the right to abortion.\n\nMajor interstate court battles along these lines are set to erupt after Roe - from the policing of women and other pregnant people's interstate travel, to the functioning of telehealth services that can prescribe abortion pills across state lines, to the criminalization of those who share resources and material support to aid abortions.\n\nThe Columbia Law Review paper's authors highlight that these fights will make a mockery of Republican claims that Roe has made abortion law more, rather than less, complicated. If legal confusions produce openings after Roe - spaces to set up new access sites and build greater networks, while finding new loopholes and ways to be ungovernable against repressive government action - we must take such advantage where we can.\n\nReproductive rights demonstrators protest outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on May 3, 2022.\n\nIt's already clear that there will be more arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonments of abortion providers, supporters, and seekers. A recent attempt by a local law enforcement agency in Texas to charge a young woman, Lizelle Herrera, with murder in connection to a \"self-induced abortion\" failed because no such murder statute for charging pregnant people currently exists in the state. We have seen, though, how swiftly such laws are changing for the worse.\n\nThe policing of this post-Roe world gives us much reason to fear - but even more reason to resist, and fight with and for the communities with the least power, who will no doubt be the most targeted.\n\nNetworks already exist to send abortion medication to jurisdictions where it has been made illegal. These will have to grow, using various online tools and techniques, physical mailing systems, and assistance with transportation - especially to ensure that those with the fewest resources are reached.\n\nCrucially, though, this fight is something to join, not invent anew. Many will be shocked by the end of Roe, but they need to realize that there are existing efforts and groups on the ground that need support, more so than major organizations like Planned Parenthood .\n\nOne thing that is abundantly clear in this still-emerging landscape is that we cannot focus solely on the law . Republican terror tactics against abortions have not hewed to existing statute; they have forged new realities to de facto ban abortion through brutal state action in clear violation of existing constitutional law and done so in the knowledge that these constitutional protections were on their last legs. The same extralegal Republican approach informs the right's attacks on trans lives, and they are constantly pushing it further.\n\nIn his draft opinion , Alito also criticizes Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated sodomy laws, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. \"[N]one of these rights,\" the justice wrote, \"has any claim to being deeply rooted in history.\" This is what fascists and their allies are fighting for: not just an end to abortions, horrifying enough as that is, but the palingenesis of a nation, in which the only rights permitted to stand are those that protect property, patriarchy, and whiteness - such, in Alito's own framing, is the rooting of U.S. history.\n\nContrary to liberal mythologizing, the battle for bodily autonomy and justice was never won in the Supreme Court. The fight did not begin at the court, and it will not end there. On Monday night, a crowd of many hundreds gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington, chanting, \"Fascist scum have got to go.\" It is certainly in this antifascist spirit that the fight must go on.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "By Vowing to Codify Roe, Kamala Harris Ensures Continued Government Meddling in Abortion Care\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nReproductive justice advocates warn that stopping at enshrining Roe's protections would allow abortion bans and restrictions to flourish.\n\nAfter months of touring the country to push back against draconian restrictions on abortion care, Vice President Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights central to her nascent presidential campaign. She has pledged to turn back the clock on Dobbs, the Supreme Court ruling that eliminated constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n\"We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris told Politico. \"And that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"\n\nThat vision is not exactly visionary. A growing number of abortion advocates say that codifying Roe only guarantees government interference in reproductive health care - the very thing Harris has said she opposes.\n\nCalling to \"restore Roe is a call to continue banning abortion and to continue criminalizing pregnant people,\" said Dr. Jenni Villavicencio, an OB-GYN and complex family planning specialist who provides all-trimester abortion care. \"It is an outdated call that in reality threatens, harms, and punishes abortion seekers and their providers.\"\n\nAhead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, dozens of advocates are calling for an expansive vision of abortion rights that they hope Harris and other politicians will embrace to create equitable reproductive health policy. They are pointing to a memo titled \" Abortion Justice, Now \" of which Villavicencio is a primary co-author, that lays out a vision of reproductive freedom that expands far beyond the reaches of Roe.\n\nThe memo calls on elected officials to instead enact protections for patients and doctors throughout pregnancy that center the needs of the most vulnerable, and it points to federal legislation filed last year as a first step in that direction. \"We can and should invest in bold policies, not restoring Roe,\" the 17-page memo reads. \"Given that past is prologue, a return to a Roe-era status quo squanders a once in a generation opportunity to reimagine reproductive rights, health, and justice.\"\n\nThe right to abortion guaranteed by Roe (carried through and refined under later Supreme Court decisions ) was always considered a floor and not a ceiling. In other words, Roe provided a base level of reproductive freedom but did not constrain states from going further to protect reproductive rights.\n\nFunctionally speaking, however, Roe provided anti-abortion activists and politicians the framework to begin restricting access even as the opinion's ink was drying. Roe and its progeny ultimately enshrined limits on abortion rights, allowing states to restrict abortion after a certain point in pregnancy, when the government's so-called interests in protecting fetal life give it the green light to impose limits on care.\n\nThe new abortion policy memo tackles these limitations head on. In addition to Villavicencio, the memo's authors include Dr. Colleen McNicholas , an OB-GYN who provides all-trimester abortion; Pamela Merritt, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice ; and Garin Marschall and Erika Christensen, directors of Patient Forward, which advocates for all-trimester abortion care. (Villavicencio and McNicholas recently co-founded the reproductive justice policy group Raven Lab for Reproductive Liberation , for which Merritt serves as a senior adviser.)\n\nIn the memo, they note that \"states were not required to ban abortion after viability,\" but Roe's framework allowed them to do so. As a pregnancy advanced under Roe, it was subject to increased surveillance while abortion was subject to increased restriction. The Roe framework and its generous caveats also encouraged a slew of other restrictions on access, such as waiting periods, that were ostensibly aimed at shoring up patient health and safety, but were mostly based on junk science . Thousands of such proposals have been filed in legislatures throughout the country, and since the early 2010s, well over 1,000 have made it onto the books. Read Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court toppled Roe in its 2022 Dobbs decision, 43 states had banned abortion after some point in pregnancy. Since then, 14 states have banned abortion entirely , while 27 others imposed a gestational limit, many of them well before viability, which is generally considered to begin around 24 weeks. Limited exceptions, many of which are purposely vague , have seen pregnant people scrambling for care, increasingly across state lines.\n\nThe patchwork abortion rights system created under Roe, where socioeconomic status and ZIP code often determined whether a person was able to exercise their constitutional right to abortion, has also worsened exponentially over the last two years; in each case the most vulnerable and marginalized communities are largely left out of the fold.\n\nBut the Dobbs decision has also sparked sustained activism. Kansans were the first to speak at the ballot box when, less than two months after the Dobbs decision, voters fought back an effort to overturn the state's constitutional protection for abortion. Since then, every state that has taken up abortion has either voted to protect access or to fend off anti-abortion measures. So far, abortion measures in eight states have been certified for the ballot in November, with similar efforts underway in another three states.\n\nIn most of those states, voters will be asked to codify measures designed in Roe's image - in other words, abortion rights with an asterisk.\n\nVillavicencio belongs to an oft-vilified group of physicians that provide abortion care later in pregnancy, a fluid concept that can begin around 21 weeks. She lamented during a recent press conference that she has \"watched advocates, both elected and unelected, specifically use us and our patients as bargaining chips in their quests for political wins.\"\n\nWhile abortion later in pregnancy is uncommon , it is vital for those who need it . Still, political jockeying has for decades put a target on patients who seek such care, as well as their providers - even though the gestational and viability limits imposed on abortion care make little, if any, medical sense .\n\nThe advocates' new memo lays out the case for doing away with this framework altogether. Not only does the Roe paradigm cut off patients from care, but it also does the work of anti-abortion activists, Villavicencio said, helping them to \"enshrine a place for the government in pregnancy decisions.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Even though the notion of viability is fluid and can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy, the memo notes, gestational and viability limits encourage the policing of pregnancy - and have fueled a rise in its criminalization .\n\nFor the government to impose these artificial lines would reinforce the \"underlying logic\" of the fetal personhood movement, which argues that fetuses enjoy the same constitutional rights as actual people and is the end game for far-right anti-abortion activists and a goal laid out in the 2024 Republican Party platform. \"Enshrining a viability standard in federal law is not an incremental step toward expansive rights,\" reads the memo. \"On the contrary, viability and gestational duration limits are an incremental step toward establishing fetal personhood.\"\n\n\"Viability and gestational duration limits are an incremental step toward establishing fetal personhood.\"\n\nAhead of the DNC, more than 200 organizations and individuals have signed on in support of the new policy memo. They point, in part, to the Abortion Justice Act , introduced in June 2023 by Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as a model for abortion protection going forward. The bill would eliminate government intrusion in individual reproductive health decisions and expand access to care, in part through federal grants to support the training of abortion providers, the construction of clinics, and the direct support of individuals seeking care.\n\nThe policy memo builds on a foundation that is readily available and advocates for a more inclusive vision of reproductive freedom and equality, Merritt, Raven Lab's senior adviser, said. \"The Abortion Justice Now position is an incredibly necessary tool,\" she said. \"We have created a tool that we really do want the movement to use to combat not just the anti-abortion movement's playbook, but also to combat the fear of organizing toward justice.\"\n\nEnshrining Roe just won't cut it, she said. \"We have spent 49 years in a defensive posture, protecting Roe, because it's what we got. ... It is simply not the framework we need in 2024 and moving forward.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Reversing Roe v. Wade Is All About Minority Rule\n\nGrace Molteni/Mother Jones; Andrew Rice/Unsplash\n\nMonika Bauerlein May 9, 2022\n\nThis is about minority rule. And it always has been.\n\nThat's what I found myself thinking as I watched my feeds fill with the breaking news of the Supreme Court leaked draft decision to overrule Roe v. Wade last week (and I'd love to hear how you're processing the news-share your thoughts here ).\n\nI thought about the pregnancies that my loved ones, my friends, and I have ended, and about what it would have been like to be forced by the state to carry them to term. I thought about a future of state-enforced pregnancies for my children. I thought about the lives lost trying to end pregnancies with no legal protection. I reread the searing 2004 essay in which Mother Jones contributor Eleanor Cooney recalled her terrifying pre- Roe journey to doctor after doctor, each of whom told her she was \"too far gone\" for an illegal abortion. The article contains a photo of a woman who died in 1964, after her boyfriend tried to perform an abortion in a hotel room. It is grim. And necessary.\n\nBut most of all, I thought about how far gone a democracy is when 54 percent of the population support a constitutional right and 28 percent oppose it, yet the 28 percent position wins out.\n\nMy colleague Ari Berman wrote about this in 2019, after Georgia passed one of the first in the new crop of anti-abortion bills even though only 44 percent of Georgians favored it. As Ari explained, \"Republicans invest so much energy into voter suppression...because it allows them to enact cruel, unpopular policies with no accountability at the ballot box. The GOP doesn't need to have the support of a majority of the state's voters if it skews who actually gets to vote.\"\n\nSame in Washington, DC. Five of the Supreme Court's nine justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. In the Senate, the 50 Republican senators represent 41 million fewer people than the 50 Democrats. The GOP controls state legislatures and congressional delegations through an absurd degree of gerrymandering: In Wisconsin, 75 percent of districts are heavily Republican, even though Joe Biden won the state in 2020. In Texas , just under 40 percent of the population is white, but white voters are the majority in 60 percent of state legislative seats. (It took me a minute to wrap my head around that math.) The Texas legislature that passed a \"heartbeat\" bill, which forces women to leave the state for abortion care, is 73 percent male and 61 percent white . It's hard not to think of apartheid-era South Africa when you look at numbers like that.\n\nTough words? Maybe-but these are tough facts, and sugarcoating them doesn't serve anyone. In fact, there's an argument that sugarcoating the abortion debate is part of what got us here. As the journalist Farai Chideya, who hosts the podcast Our Body Politic , wrote on Twitter , \"Too many times I've been in newsrooms where a post- Roe and post-Voting Rights Act future was dismissed summarily as a possibility. So we as a profession created a dangerous filter bubble, dismissing individuals and groups as fringe when they were the tip of the spear.\"\n\nI don't need to tell you that at MoJo , these possibilities were not dismissed: They were investigated. Seven years ago, Molly Redden documented how, in many places, \" the war on women is over, and women lost .\" Three years ago, Becca Andrews showed how women in Mississippi were already living in a post- Roe world, and Nina Liss-Schultz outlined how abortion rights defenders were preparing for worse yet to come. Stephanie Mencimer laid out what Sam Alito is all about back in 2016. (\"If you want to know his judicial philosophy,\" one legal expert summarized, \"just look at the Republican Party platform.\") Just a few weeks ago Arianna Coghill chronicled how states were tripping over each other to pass anti-abortion laws, and Lil Kalish showed how technology may help states that want to force people to stay pregnant.\n\nThese journalists in our newsroom, and many others, were not chronicling the battle over abortion as a he-said-she-said political fight. They were illuminating the visceral stakes for people's lives. All of our lives. Something else I've been thinking about is how different my life has been from my great-grandmother's Therese's. She gave birth 17 times and had to bury six of her children. I'm grateful that my grandfather was one of the survivors. But what if Therese had been able to choose motherhood rather than endure it? We're not far removed from these times.\n\nThe story of abortion is about whether people get to make profoundly personal decisions themselves. It's about whether parents are allowed to love and support their children ; whether people can get life-saving medical care without fear of imprisonment; whether sexual harassment and sexual assault are condoned or confronted ; whether women should be more harshly punished for confronting an abuser than the abusers themselves. All of these issues are connected, and all are connected with the fundamental question of whether our democracy works for all, or is hijacked to serve a minority's last-chance grasp for power.\n\nAnd that story is at the heart of what Mother Jones does. \"Two days out from the news and I'm still reeling,\" my colleague Inae Oh, MoJo 's senior news and engagement editor, wrote in our newsletter. \"But the initial shock has also given way to a kind of mobilization in the newsroom that, at least for me, echoes the emergency of election night in 2016, when it became clear that the unthinkable had actually happened.\"\n\n\"I'll never forget the all-hands-on-deck feeling,\" Inae writes. \"Despite the anger and despair, everyone wanted to pitch in, plan the fight. Something similar is happening now as abortion rights hang in the balance. The pages of Mother Jones are making sure to call it like it is.\"\n\nAnd calling it like it is can make a big difference. This week I found myself thinking way back to 2010, when Republicans took over Congress in a backlash to the first Black president. Many in the media were covering the tea party as if it were a brand new phenomenon, but it wasn't hard to see that its agenda was very familiar. Within weeks the new majority was trying to redefine rape so as to deny abortions to women who needed federal funds. MoJo 's reporting on this change, buried deep in an amendment, spurred a backlash and \"Dear John\" letter-writing campaign to then-House Speaker John Boehner, and the legislation died .\n\nThat was when Republicans still thought of themselves as a potential majority party that needed to be careful about offending the majority of the country. Today's GOP has fewer qualms, because it has bet on minority rule, and Trump has shown them that when you're appealing to a minority of the population, cruelty can be a winner. Alito's draft Supreme Court opinion recognizes no exception for the pregnant person's life or health, or for rape or incest-even though overwhelming majorities, including four in five Republicans , support those exceptions. It takes aim at same-sex marriage, which a majority of Republicans support . And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott chose this moment to talk about challenging a Court decision affirming public education for all.\n\nThat's the bigger picture of what happened this week, and that's what MoJo has been covering-to the point where now, others are starting to recognize the patterns too. This week I saw the term \"minority rule\" in a lot of other media as they covered the decision. It took long enough.\n\nSo as we start the first full week of this new reality, I'm also reminding myself that by no means all is lost. So many people-including so many of you-are gearing up to protect your rights and those of others. Some are donating to abortion funds and signing up as clinic volunteers, some are clearing their calendars for canvassing, or running, in the elections this fall. Some are thinking of new ways to ensure access to reproductive care . Some are committing themselves to the long, hard, yet hopeful work of organizing the majority of Americans who want a democratic government that respects their private choices.\n\nAs we see over and over around the world, minority rule is both oppressive and, ultimately, fragile. Over the long haul, it is always on the defensive against the collective power of a determined majority.\n\nAnd it's always on the defensive against the power of facts . It's telling that shortly after the decision was leaked, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pleaded with conservatives to position themselves as \"compassionate consensus builders\" and emphasizing that \"Republicans DO NOT want to take away contraception\" and \"DO NOT want to throw doctors and women in jail.\" In fact, Republicans cheerfully kept saying that they wanted to do exactly that.\n\nExposing lies and undermining talking points is what Mother Jones exists to do, and it showed last week. In just one day while I was writing this, here's what my colleagues published: A story from Kiera Butler, who is based in Georgia, about how social media has become a breeding ground for anti-birth control disinformation covertly promoted by anti-abortion groups. A powerful dispatch from Florida, where Laura C. Morel investigated the increasingly aggressive tactics that protesters are using to harass. An analysis by Jackie Mogensen, who read through the entirety of Justice Alito's 98-page opinion and tallied all of its footnotes to see how often Alito cited scholarship and judicial opinions from men vs women. (Do yourself a favor and watch her share the results in just one fact-packed minute!)\n\nWhen the Supreme Court news hit last week, Mother Jones was in the middle of a spring fundraising drive that is critical to keeping these reporters and others on the beat.

      "text": "Overturning Roe v. Wade Led to More Abortions Overall, According to New Research\n\nRichard Vogel/AP\n\nAbortion-rights opponents have long said their goal is to end abortion nationwide. So when they succeeded in overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, it seemed to be the closest they'd ever come.\n\nYet new data is making it increasingly clear that in the 12 months after the court ended the national right to abortion, licensed clinicians provided slightly more abortions nationwide, not fewer. According to numbers released Tuesday by the Society of Family Planning , a professional association for healthcare providers who specialize in abortion and contraception, even as 14 states enacted near-total bans on abortion, the number of abortions performed in states bordering the new abortion deserts surged, making up the difference. In particular, California, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and New Mexico saw their monthly abortion numbers skyrocket.\n\nThe report, the fourth installment in the Society of Family Planning's #WeCount project , tallies a year's worth of medication and other abortions reported by licensed providers working in brick-and-mortar abortion clinics, private medical offices, telehealth clinics, and hospitals. The researchers did not attempt to count self-managed abortions. Their findings are in line with research released last month by the Guttmacher Institute, which used a statistical model, historical data, and surveys to estimate that 46,000 more abortions took place in the first six months of 2023 compared to the first six months of 2020. \"We're using two different methodologies and finding more or less the same patterns,\" says Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at Guttmacher.\n\nThe new data underscores the argument from abortion-rights advocates that abortion bans don't stop abortions. But the overall slight rise in abortion numbers nationwide \"is not evidence that the bans are not working,\" warns Ushma Upadhyay, #WeCount co-chair and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. \"What actually happened during these 12 months is that abortion access plummeted to zero in some states, while increasing to meet the acute need in others.\"\n\nMeeting that need has required a monumental effort across the abortion care infrastructure. Providers relocated or opened new clinics while advocates switched into overdrive, operating networks of organizations that provide funding , support , and information to scared and confused patients. Since Dobbs , at least 114 facilities have raised limits on how late in pregnancy they will perform abortions, expanding options for patients seeking an abortion after the first trimester, according to recent UCSF research. State and municipal governments set aside nearly $208 million to pay for abortion, contraception, and support service-including a $20 million budget line item in California paying for out-of-state patients to travel there for abortions. Donations to abortion funds soared, too-at least temporarily . Meanwhile, virtual clinics that provide abortion pills by mail have grown steadily since 2020 , when a federal court (later followed by the FDA) halted an old rule requiring patients to pick up the medication from a clinic in person. Since Dobbs, the average monthly number of abortions provided by virtual-only clinics increased by 72 percent, according to the data released Tuesday.\n\nAll of these changes add up to expanded access in states that protect abortion-benefitting both in- and out-of-state patients. Yet this new normal is fragile. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to take up a case that could eliminate access to the common abortion medication mifepristone. The state supreme court in Florida, another surge state, is currently considering whether to affirm a 15-week ban on abortion; if it does, a 6-week ban will take effect shortly afterward. Amber Gavin, vice president of advocacy and operations at A Woman's Choice, an independent clinic with locations in North Carolina and Florida, is awaiting that decision nervously. \"I'm truly not sure where the thousands of people across the Southeast who need abortion care after six weeks will turn to, as many of our abortion clinics are at capacity and it could take weeks for folks to get an appointment,\" Gavin says.\n\nAs always, the curse is time: Every week it takes make a decision, find an appointment, and pull together the money-then arrange time off work, childcare, and travel-pushes a patient further into pregnancy. Take too long, and you could pass gestational limits in surrounding states, or require a more expensive and time-consuming procedure. Megan Jeyifo, the executive director of the Chicago Abortion Fund, says she hears stories about \"the difficulty of parsing through disinformation and fake abortion clinics, confusion regarding legality, worry about costs and travel barriers, lack of available appointments in surge states, and delays due to securing time off from work or childcare.\" Before Dobbs , the average caller to the Chicago Abortion Fund's hotline was 9.9 weeks into pregnancy; after, that figure rose to 15.6 weeks.\n\nCould Dobbs not only have led to overall increases in abortion, but also caused more people to get abortions later in pregnancy? \"It's exactly the question that everyone is asking,\" Upadhyay says. \"It's important to know all of the effects of these bans.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Roe v. Wade Was Killed by Minority Rule\n\nProtesters hold cardboard cutouts of the Supreme Court Justices that support overturning Roe v. Wade. Gina M Randazzo/Zuma\n\nSome Supreme Court opinions are hard to unpack. Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion striking down Roe v. Wade , though, can be summarized in just a few words. \"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,\" he wrote.\n\nThe first two clauses are the news, but the last line, more than just a quick housekeeping note, is the story of how we got here. The defeat of Roe was made possible by cutting corners and seizing every advantage in an undemocratic system-it was a redistribution of power bordering on theft.\n\nThere are layers to the crisis of legitimacy here, but the most obvious one is this: Of the six justices who voted to end the constitutional right to an abortion-Chief Justice John Roberts' caveats are the sort of thing that only he could care about right now-five were appointed by a president who first came to office after losing the national popular vote. In the cases of Roberts and Alito, the president who appointed them was himself placed in office with the help of the Supreme Court. And Neil Gorsuch owes his job not just to Donald Trump, but to a Senate that blocked a Democratic president from filling the seat for a year.\n\nIn returning power to the states-or Congress-the justices are now returning the ball to uneven playing fields, which in some cases they have played a part in creating. The Senate is undemocratic in its composition-as Mother Jones CEO Monika Bauerlein noted earlier this year, Republican senators represent 41 million fewer people than Democratic senators-and in its ethos. It is bound by an anti-majoritarian set of rules, and filled with people (including some Democrats) who simply don't believe that the chamber should swing in accordance with the national will. The Supreme Court has gutted the Voting Rights Act at the federal level, inviting states to attack the franchise as they see fit. And in places like Wisconsin, Democratic-leaning electorates have been simply unable to elect Democratic legislatures because of an impenetrable gerrymandering wall constructed more than a decade ago. The Supreme Court has largely given the green light to such efforts in Wisconsin and other states . Abortion rights are now in the hands of \"the people and their elected representatives,\" Alito says-but those aren't the same things, and he's helped ensure that the latter isn't bound as closely to the former.\n\nOne of the defining stories of the last two decades is the transfer of power from a minority of the electorate to an all-powerful assembly of justices, who in turn have bestowed that power upon the most reactionary of states; it's like money-laundering for democratic legitimacy-a crowning achievement for an age of conservative minority rule.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Mississippi Urges Supreme Court to Overturn Roe v. Wade\n\nSupreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is sworn in during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Oct. 12, 2020. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nOn Thursday, the state of Mississippi filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v. Wade -the landmark decision establishing a constitutional right to an abortion -and uphold the state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court will hear the case in the fall. And it escalates a string of legal challenges reaching the Court as states move to restrict abortion access.\n\n\"This Court should overrule Roe and Casey ,\" said the brief, referring to the 1973 ruling and another case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , from 1992 which upheld but \" reined in \" Roe . \" Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong. They have proven hopelessly unworkable. They have inflicted profound damage. Decades of progress have overtaken them. Reliance interests do not support retaining them. And nothing but a full break from those cases can stem the harms they have caused.\"\n\nWhen Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch urged the Court to hear the case last June, after the state's strict abortion ban was blocked by the lower courts , she said \"the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey .\" (Mississippi's law was challenged by the sole remaining abortion provider in the state.)\n\nBut Mississippi has now taken a more radical position after Amy Coney Barrett, whose record on abortion rights swings hard right, replaced Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a staunch pro-choice advocate , on the court, shifting a 5 to 4 conservative court to a 6 to 3 one.\n\nWhile the Court has achieved many long-standing goals of the conservative movement- gutting voting rights protections , overturning restrictions on money in politics, weakening the power of unions-overturning Roe has always been at the top of the right's wish list.\n\nThis was exactly the situation Democrats feared when Barrett was confirmed to the court.\n\nAs a University of Notre Dame Law School professor, Barrett signed an ad that stated, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.\" During her confirmation hearing, Barrett said she did not believe Roe was a \"super-precedent\" that the court could not overturn, unlike decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education . \"That doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively it does mean that it's not a case that everyone has accepted,\" Barrett said. Leading pro-choice activists, including RBG before she was nominated to the bench, have long warned that Roe is potentially a weak legal precedent and didn't go far enough to protect abortion rights.\n\nBarrett was confirmed just eight days before the 2020 election, when 65 million people had already voted, even though Mitch McConnell blocked the nomination of Merrick Garland eight months before the 2016 election, who is now Attorney General under Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, the circumstances surrounding the confirmation of another justice nominated by President Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, continue to attract scrutiny. The New York Times reported on Thursday that the FBI received 4,500 tips about sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh during a background check but forwarded the most \"relevant\" ones to the Trump White House, which suggests that serious accusations against Kavanaugh were never properly investigated before he was narrowly confirmed to the court.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "On the Anniversary of Roe v. Wade, States Are Scrambling to Preserve It\n\nActivists protest abortion bans in the Utah State Capitol Rotunda on May 21, 2019, in Salt Lake City. Rick Bowmer/AP\n\nOn this day in 1973, the Supreme Court issued a decision that enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade. But with mounting attacks on abortion rights and the most conservative Supreme Court in modern history, states across the country have spent the 47th year of Roe scrambling to protect a women's right to choose in the increasingly plausible event that the historic court decision is soon overturned.\n\n\"The reality is that the balance of the Supreme Court is not in our favor,\" says Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, who works on state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood, adding, \"We have to be prepared [if] Roe falls. That's just part of the reality of living under the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe effort began exactly one year ago, when New York became the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its state law, effectively codifying Roe v. Wade. (The law also ended New York's ban on abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.) Since then, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Vermont have all passed similar laws protecting the right to an abortion. Michigan, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia are also looking at codifying the right to an abortion. In 2019, statehouses passed more legislation protecting or expanding abortion access than in the entire previous decade .\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the confirmation of two staunchly conservative justices to the Supreme Court in 2018, red states have been doing the opposite kind of preparation for a post- Roe world. In 2019, four states -Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee-passed legislation known as trigger laws, which would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturned Roe , and 12 states passed abortion bans. In total, eight states now have trigger laws on the books, and 20 have laws that could be used to restrict the right to an abortion if Roe were overturned.\n\n\"States are going in widely divergent directions when it comes to both abortion rights and abortion access,\" says Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health. \"We have a group of states last year that were tripping over each other in a race to the bottom to try to ban abortion outright, and then we also had a real record year on the other side.\"\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, roughly 25 million women of reproductive age live in a state where abortion could be banned if Roe is overturned. Millions more are already forced to jump through hoops to access abortions, including 72-hour waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and invasive ultrasound procedures .\n\nIn March, the Supreme Court will hear its first abortion case since the confirmation of conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law , which requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, a stipulation that opponents of the bill argue would leave the state with only one provider for a population of more than 4.5 million . Although the justices are not expected to overturn Roe outright in this case, legal experts argue that if the court were to rule in favor of the law, access to abortion in states like Louisiana could exist in name only.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"We Do This as Parents\": Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union-Wade's Emotional Call to Support Trans Kids\n\nChris Delmas/Getty\n\nNearly three months into 2023, it's easier to count the states that aren't considering legislation attacking LGBTQ rights. Around 327 bills proposed this legislative session target queer and trans people across the country, and much of their impact would fall on kids: the nonbinary student afraid of losing their home and family if their school outs them to their parents, the trans preteen hoping to delay puberty while they take their time understanding their gender.\n\nFor the last two years, under the banner of \" parents' rights ,\" conservatives have pushed to ban books involving queer issues and racism, end the teaching of African American studies , and restrict discussion of LGBTQ issues . But as Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund senior counsel Gabriel Arkles observed to Salon , this conception of parental rights is \"super-selective\": \"They certainly do not want to support the rights of parents that support trans kids, only the rights of parents that don't want their trans kids to exist,\" Arkles said.\n\nIn this climate, the voices of parents who support their trans children are particularly resonant. So it was an emotional moment at the NAACP Image Awards yesterday, when NBA superstar Dwyane Wade praised his 15-year-old daughter, Zaya, whose legal name and gender change were approved by a Los Angeles judge on Friday. \"I admire how you handle the ignorance in our world,\" Wade said , addressing Zaya onstage. \"As your father my job isn't to create a version of myself that directs your future. My role is to be a facilitator to your hopes, your wishes, your dreams.\"\n\nAnd actor Gabrielle Union-Wade called on the racial justice movement to make \"room for everyone.\" \"The intersection of Black rights and the rights of the LGBTQIA, trans and gender non-conforming people continues to be rough,\" she said. \"Even as we demand equality at the top of our lungs, we consistently fail to extend our advocacy to protect some of our most vulnerable.\"\n\nThe pair were onstage to accept the NAACP president's award for their philanthropy, which involves supporting organizations that fight bullying and provide healthcare to queer and trans patients. \"We honestly don't approach this work as activists or leaders, as much as we do this as parents,\" Gabrielle Union-Wade added. \"Parents who love our children and will do whatever the hell we can to keep them seen and secure and safe.\"\n\nWatch the speeches here:\n\nDwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union's powerful full speeches at the #NAACPImageAwards\n\n\"Even as we demand equality at the top of our lungs, we consistently fail to extend our advocacy to protect some of our most vulnerable.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/8ZzvR2dWfR\n\n- philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) February 26, 2023\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nA conversation with journalist Amanda Becker about her new book, You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America .\n\nAmanda Becker is no stranger to tackling tough topics head-on. The Washington correspondent for the nonprofit news organization The 19th , Amanda has spent over a decade covering Congress, the White House, and elections, having previously worked at Reuters and CQ Roll Call. Amanda is also an Ohio native and brings a personal connection to the challenges faced in her home state, particularly the restrictive abortion laws that have long shaped the lives of many.\n\nHer latest book, You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America , was born out of what she describes as a moment of \"seismic change\" following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . While on a family trip in Florida, Becker learned through the draft leak that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade , and she immediately understood that her book would be \"the most important story\" she would ever cover.\n\nIn You Must Stand Up , Becker follows grassroots leaders, healthcare providers, and activists as they navigate the chaotic aftermath of the ruling. Becker also acknowledges the complexities of reporting on abortion at this moment when, as one clinic worker pointed out, \"the world is gawking at our trauma.\" Real people are impacted by these legislative and judicial decisions, and Becker doesn't shy away from the complicated realities that we are all living in. At the same time, Becker offers a powerful portrait of resilience and hope in the fight for abortion rights and access for everyone.\n\nI spoke with Amanda about her process and the challenges that came with documenting the first year after Dobbs , a time when it seemed as if everything was in flux, and about the remarkable ways providers, activists, and everyday people have navigated and resisted the attacks on abortion access. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\n-Larada Lee-Wallace\n\nLLW: The Dobbs decision has had a profound impact on abortion access across the country. How did you choose what subjects to focus on in your book, and what were the most striking differences you observed in how different regions responded to the decision?\n\nAB: I chose to focus on the first year without federal abortion rights to capture a snapshot of what it meant to live in a post- Dobbs world. I wanted to illuminate the different realities Americans face under new abortion restrictions and highlight the varied responses across regions.\n\nTuscaloosa, Alabama, was a primary focus because Robin Marty-executive director of the West Alabama Women's Center-was a key figure in providing insight into the challenges of a state with strict abortion bans.\n\nRobin's connections led me to Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick, who founded the Camelback Family Planning Center in Phoenix, Arizona, which offered a contrasting perspective from the western United States.\n\nI also included tertiary settings like Ohio, where I have personal ties, to explore its direct ballot initiative aimed at protecting abortion rights, while Wisconsin illustrates how democratic responses are unfolding in the face of restrictive laws.\n\nOverall, I selected these locations to highlight not only the varied regional responses but also to address the broader theme of democratic erosion and the disconnect between laws and public opinion.\n\nLLW: \"Creative resistance\" is a key theme in your book. Can you share some examples of the innovative strategies that activists, healthcare providers, or legal teams used to navigate the new post- Dobbs landscape?\n\nAB: I think Dr. Gabrielle Goodrick is a prime example of creative resistance. As an abortion provider, her expertise lies in medicine, not legal strategy. Yet, she has adeptly navigated the post- Dobbs landscape by using her medical knowledge to circumvent restrictive laws.\n\nArizona law currently restricts most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with few exceptions, and imposes strict regulations on providers, making access more challenging. The situation worsened when a pre-statehood law kicked in that was a near-total ban on abortion. Although the 15-week ban was later reinstated, the legal uncertainty created confusion and it was difficult for Dr. Goodrick or other providers to know on a day-to-day basis which law was in place and how they were able to treat patients.\n\nDr. Goodrick explores how to provide the same standard of care within the confines of new regulations and the title of the book is from a blog post she wrote that called on doctors to protect their profession.\n\nIn addition to providers like Dr. Goodrick, the book highlights various ways in which people figured out their role to play in our democracy to protect abortion rights. For instance, medical students have had to adapt to new challenges, such as limited access to OB-GYN education in certain areas. Everyday voters also play a crucial role, as shown in the chapter set in Kentucky, which underscores the importance of active engagement to ensure voters, who overwhelmingly support abortion access, have a voice in shaping policies.\n\nThese examples collectively demonstrate that when faced with significant challenges, individuals and groups can find innovative ways to contribute to causes they care about, they just have to figure out what their specific role is based on their strengths and expertise.\n\nLLW: What were some of the challenges you faced in documenting the first year after Roe was overturned, given that it was such a rapidly evolving situation? How did you ensure your reporting remained accurate and up-to-date?\n\nAB: I was actually doing the Nieman Fellowship at Harvard during much of this first year after Dobbs , and it was not a book fellowship. I was trying to balance what my responsibilities for the fellowship were and what I was looking forward to-having a break from the newsroom as I was doing this fantastic fellowship.\n\nThe nature of book writing offers both luxuries and challenges compared to daily journalism. While I had the time to reflect and revise, this also meant that my work was often subject to change long after it was written. To address this, I focused on capturing the accuracy of events as they unfolded in real-time, knowing that updates might be needed.\n\nA prime example is Arizona, where legal confusion and shifting regulations created a chaotic environment. The state's situation was in constant flux, with even Republican officials struggling to agree on which laws were in effect. I was aware that some details might become outdated quickly, but documenting this ongoing uncertainty was crucial to illustrating the confusion and distress experienced by abortion providers and other stakeholders in those early months.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nLLW: What do you hope readers take away from these stories, and what they tell us about the post- Dobbs landscape?\n\nAB: I hope readers gain a deeper understanding of what I like to refer to as the \"connective tissues\" of our democracy. The US democratic system is incredibly complex, with numerous forces at play, including those who profit from understanding and exploiting its intricacies. I want readers to grasp how our democracy functions on a granular level, which will hopefully empower them to participate more fully and confidently in the democratic process.\n\nThe post- Dobbs landscape has created vastly different realities for Americans depending on where they live, illuminating the erosion of democratic norms and equal rights across the country. But if abortion rights are issue someone cares about, there is a role for everyone to play, and the book is showing people who have figured out what their specific role is based on their own experience and expertise.\n\nAnother key takeaway I hope to impart is the importance of active participation in democracy. It's not about passively waiting for change to happen. Democracy offers direct avenues for engagement, such as ballot initiatives , and we elect representatives to serve our interests. When they fail to do so, it's crucial for us to remember that we have the power to hold them accountable and, if necessary, replace them. People need to take this responsibility seriously if they believe their elected officials are not representing their interests. My hope is that these stories I tell can be used as a manual for how people can participate in US democracy.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025. But we can't do this without you. As a reader-supported publication, we rely on the support of generous donors.

(Photo By Sthanlee B. Mirador / Sipa USA via AP Images)\n\nIt is the media silence that hurts the most. Retired Miami Heat superstar Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union have been loving and supportive parent to their trans teenage daughter, Zaya. They have shown the public the doting normality of caring for a trans child. And now the Wade family feels forced to leave Florida. The most important pro athlete in the history of Florida sports has had to move for his family's safety because of Governor Ron DeSantis-and so far, the sports world is remaining largely quiet. Related Article How Racist Car Dealers KO'd Joe Louis Silke-Maria Weineck The craven, snarling DeSantis has been monomaniacal about jamming through oppressive legislation aimed at eliminating transgender people and even public conversation about their lives. Instead of addressing the crises ravaging the state, DeSantis has chosen legislative priorities that seem written by a fascist-minded podcaster. Many in Florida and beyond are being deliberately unheard by a skittish media, some of whom are complicit in this rise of anti-trans animus. These attacks-without a robust response or even a backward response from the Democratic Party-have allowed these ideas to gain a foothold. But Wade cannot and will not be silenced. As Wade said of Florida ,\"I don't live in the state. A lot of people don't know that. I have to make decisions for my family, not just personal, individual decisions.... Yes, I had to educate myself, and yes, I had to get a better understanding. And yes, I had to lose some friends along the process, but I never wavered on loving my kids and trying to find space to get the chance to understand them.\" In a separate interview, Wade took on DeSantis, saying , \"I don't know him. But I do know men lie, women lie, but numbers don't. I do know that when our children feel accepted.... it lowers the death rate. I'm gonna step on the side of acceptance. I'm not even going to go on the other side. I'm just focused on acceptance. Let's make sure our kids have an opportunity to live this life that we all get to live.\" Related Article The GOP's War Against Trans People Is a War Against Democracy Gabriel Furshong DeSantis is the leading autocrat of a revanchist movement that has pushed nearly 500 anti-trans bills through state legislatures. It is not surprising that the dangerous, anti-trans fervor has endangered the Wade family, even with their wealth and renown. The Wades' fame actually makes them more of a target-as Wade and Union found out when they traveled to the seemingly safe environs of New York City for the Knicks' opening round playoff series against the Miami Heat. Following the Heat victory, angry Knicks fans yelled that Wade and Union were \"mutilating\" their child. There is also robust, violent ant-trans community on Twitter that, when they aren't celebrating bomb threats against children's hospitals, are holding up Wade and Union as \"child abusers.\" Through the prism of these monstrous scapegoaters, a man who says, \"I never wavered on loving my kids\" is called \"an abuser.\" (I'm not litigious by nature, but I hope Wade sues them all for defamation.) Yet, in the face of all of this, even with Wade using his platform to stand up for trans lives, his self-exile has not been widely discussed or reported upon in the sports world. There are no breathless takes on ESPN's yakathon of programming. Even though Wade's next venture as a game show host is being advertised throughout the NBA playoffs on TNT, it is not being mentioned in the broadcasts. Maybe it is just me, but I think a politician's driving out an athlete who made his mark on and off the court in Florida should be a bigger deal. The sports media is demonstrating either complicity or fear. (My guess is fear.) The same ESPN network that celebrated Caitlin Jenner's transition when waters were calmer is now cowed by fears of backlash. Its own anchors, like Sage Steele, take to Twitter to spread anti-trans talking points, yet neither she nor her colleagues are willing to stand up for the Wade family now. Wade has allies throughout the sports world, including in the upper echelons of the NBA offices. It's time they break their silence.\n\nAnd now the Wade family feels forced to leave Florida.

Wade has allies throughout the sports world, including in the upper echelons of the NBA offices. It's time they break their silence.\n\nThe most important pro athlete in the history of Florida sports has had to move for his family's safety because of Governor Ron DeSantis-and so far, the sports world is remaining largely quiet. Related Article How Racist Car Dealers KO'd Joe Louis Silke-Maria Weineck The craven, snarling DeSantis has been monomaniacal about jamming through oppressive legislation aimed at eliminating transgender people and even public conversation about their lives. Instead of addressing the crises ravaging the state, DeSantis has chosen legislative priorities that seem written by a fascist-minded podcaster. Many in Florida and beyond are being deliberately unheard by a skittish media, some of whom are complicit in this rise of anti-trans animus. These attacks-without a robust response or even a backward response from the Democratic Party-have allowed these ideas to gain a foothold. But Wade cannot and will not be silenced. As Wade said of Florida ,\"I don't live in the state. A lot of people don't know that. I have to make decisions for my family, not just personal, individual decisions.... Yes, I had to educate myself, and yes, I had to get a better understanding. And yes, I had to lose some friends along the process, but I never wavered on loving my kids and trying to find space to get the chance to understand them.\" In a separate interview, Wade took on DeSantis, saying , \"I don't know him. But I do know men lie, women lie, but numbers don't. I do know that when our children feel accepted.... it lowers the death rate. I'm gonna step on the side of acceptance. I'm not even going to go on the other side. I'm just focused on acceptance.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Lots of factors played a role in the Republicans' underperformance in the midterm elections, but it sure seems like the decision by conservative justices on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade was a major one. The United States Senate might have been handed back to Democrats by Samuel Alito and his extremist ruling-signed, of course, by all five of the other conservatives. One person looking to press the policy advantage Democrats currently enjoy is President Joe Biden. Over the weekend , with the House of Representatives still technically up for grabs, White House senior aide Anita Dunn went on TV to reiterate Biden's stance that Congress should \"codify Roe vs. Wade , so that it is the national law of the land.\" Biden understands that the voters have spoken, and he's positioning his administration and the Democrats as the people who want to give the voters what they want. And what they want is to not have Ted Cruz anywhere near their uteruses. I want that to happen. I think Democrats should use maximal power to enshrine abortion rights, including getting rid of the filibuster if need be. It's the right move both in terms of policy (reproductive rights should trump states' rights) and in terms of politics. But people should operate without any illusions: If the Democrats somehow pass a national law codifying Roe v. Wade , the conservative justices will use the emergency \"shadow docket\" to prevent it from taking effect and then strike it down later, when it is electorally convenient for them to do so. The idea that the conservative Supreme Court would respect an act of Congress that they don't like is a fantasy invented by Republican strategists eager to mask the true nature of our extremist court. It is pushed by mainstream media folks and court insiders in D.C. who are desperate to portray Chief Justice John Roberts as a good guy so they don't sound too \"partisan.\" It is untethered from reality: There is simply no evidence that this court would allow national abortion protections to hold. The court has revoked abortion as a federal right, which is important because that limits Congress's options. Arguably, Congress is unable to pass a national abortion protection pursant to its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment's grant of equal protection and due process, because the court denies that such grants extend to the right to choose. Other major pieces of legislation, like the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, exist only because the court acknowledges (or at least used to acknowledge) those laws as \"necessary\" to enforce the 14th and 15th amendments, respectively. I think the court is wrong and that Congress should have the authority to protect abortion rights under the 14th Amendment, but I will not be ascending to the Supreme Court anytime soon.

And I'm sorry to say that we have a ton of evidence that this court takes a dim view of the government's power to regulate health and safety. Back in January of this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers. The court, by an entirely predictable vote of 6-3, ruled that the Biden administration exceeded its authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect private employees from Covid. Indeed, throughout the pandemic, we saw the Supreme Court either strike down emergency measures relating to the crisis (like the eviction moratorium) or leave in place lower court rulings that did the same. Current Issue View our current issue Oh, but these are executive actions, you say? The court will have more respect for a health-and-safety act of Congress, you imagine? Well, let me remind you of the granddaddy of all congressional health-and-safety actions: the Affordable Care Act. People think of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius as the 2015 case where Roberts \"saved\" Obamacare, but let's remember what really happened there. On a far less extremist court, there were five votes-including one by Roberts-to invalidate the ACA as an unconstitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. The trick Roberts used to save the law was to convert the ACA from a regulatory action of Congress into a tax. It was a brilliant bit of legal obfuscation that has given Roberts his undeserved reputation of being a moderate. But make no mistake: At the beating heart of NFIB is a shocking denial of congressional authority to regulate the standard of health care that must be provided in the various states. Conservative justices barely allowed Congress to pass a minimum level of insurance coverage , but now we're supposed to believe they will let the federal government force states to provide abortions? Have you met these people? Speaking about who these people are in real life, I haven't even mentioned that these conservatives are actively trying to usher in a fundamentalist Christian theocracy and force the rest of us to live in it. The religious views of justices like Samuel Alito, alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barret are already on the record. But people forget that Roberts's wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, was a fierce forced-birth advocate before she pulled back on her public life to avoid the appearance of impropriety with Roberts on the court. People do remember that Clarence Thomas, and his wife, hold the same views and don't care about the appearance of corruption. That's five justices whose personal views, I believe, prevent them from ever allowing the government to protect the rights of women and pregnant people, law be damned (see their ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization for more evidence). The sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, barely suffers the federal government to exist. The only potential hope that abortion protections might survive this Supreme Court lies in the justices' recognition of the political gravity of their position. The justices can read exit polls, same as the rest of us. Roberts likes to deliver electorally justifiable rulings to the Republicans. Kavanaugh is so desperate to be treated by the media like Roberts gets treated that you can almost smell it on him. If they read the tea leaves, there's at least a very small chance that they would uphold national abortion protections because that would be the only way to help the Republican Party. A watered-down, bare-minimum version of abortion protections (the only kind \"Democrats\" like Joe Manchin would ever vote for in an election year), with exceptions for rape and incest, largely takes the issue off the table for the upcoming presidential election cycle. Moreover, if the court were to strike down such a bill, it would only increase the calls for Democrats to expand the court, something we know the conservatives currently looking forward to holding 30 years of unaccountable power do not want. If the GOP were a functional political party, it would jump at this chance to appear reasonable; Republicans in Congress would release their vulnerable colleagues to support Roe v. Wade ; McConnell would muster up nine or 10 votes in the Senate to obviate calls to end the filibuster; and Roberts would find some way to make it all work. But they won't do these things, because conservatives are not in a political party; they're in an ideological cult. Understanding this is key to understanding why the Supreme Court will never allow a law protecting abortion rights to exist, so long as conservatives hold the balance of power. Democrats should force the issue anyway. The more people see what this extremist court does, the more people will be willing to stop them.\n\nOne person looking to press the policy advantage Democrats currently enjoy is President Joe Biden.

The only potential hope that abortion protections might survive this Supreme Court lies in the justices' recognition of the political gravity of their position. The justices can read exit polls, same as the rest of us. Roberts likes to deliver electorally justifiable rulings to the Republicans. Kavanaugh is so desperate to be treated by the media like Roberts gets treated that you can almost smell it on him. If they read the tea leaves, there's at least a very small chance that they would uphold national abortion protections because that would be the only way to help the Republican Party. A watered-down, bare-minimum version of abortion protections (the only kind \"Democrats\" like Joe Manchin would ever vote for in an election year), with exceptions for rape and incest, largely takes the issue off the table for the upcoming presidential election cycle. Moreover, if the court were to strike down such a bill, it would only increase the calls for Democrats to expand the court, something we know the conservatives currently looking forward to holding 30 years of unaccountable power do not want. If the GOP were a functional political party, it would jump at this chance to appear reasonable; Republicans in Congress would release their vulnerable colleagues to support Roe v. Wade ; McConnell would muster up nine or 10 votes in the Senate to obviate calls to end the filibuster; and Roberts would find some way to make it all work. But they won't do these things, because conservatives are not in a political party; they're in an ideological cult. Understanding this is key to understanding why the Supreme Court will never allow a law protecting abortion rights to exist, so long as conservatives hold the balance of power. Democrats should force the issue anyway. The more people see what this extremist court does, the more people will be willing to stop them.\n\nI want that to happen. I think Democrats should use maximal power to enshrine abortion rights, including getting rid of the filibuster if need be. It's the right move both in terms of policy (reproductive rights should trump states' rights) and in terms of politics. But people should operate without any illusions: If the Democrats somehow pass a national law codifying Roe v. Wade , the conservative justices will use the emergency \"shadow docket\" to prevent it from taking effect and then strike it down later, when it is electorally convenient for them to do so. The idea that the conservative Supreme Court would respect an act of Congress that they don't like is a fantasy invented by Republican strategists eager to mask the true nature of our extremist court. It is pushed by mainstream media folks and court insiders in D.C. who are desperate to portray Chief Justice John Roberts as a good guy so they don't sound too \"partisan.\" It is untethered from reality: There is simply no evidence that this court would allow national abortion protections to hold. The court has revoked abortion as a federal right, which is important because that limits Congress's options. Arguably, Congress is unable to pass a national abortion protection pursant to its authority to enforce the 14th Amendment's grant of equal protection and due process, because the court denies that such grants extend to the right to choose. Other major pieces of legislation, like the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, exist only because the court acknowledges (or at least used to acknowledge) those laws as \"necessary\" to enforce the 14th and 15th amendments, respectively. I think the court is wrong and that Congress should have the authority to protect abortion rights under the 14th Amendment, but I will not be ascending to the Supreme Court anytime soon.

And I'm sorry to say that we have a ton of evidence that this court takes a dim view of the government's power to regulate health and safety. Back in January of this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers. The court, by an entirely predictable vote of 6-3, ruled that the Biden administration exceeded its authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect private employees from Covid. Indeed, throughout the pandemic, we saw the Supreme Court either strike down emergency measures relating to the crisis (like the eviction moratorium) or leave in place lower court rulings that did the same. Current Issue View our current issue Oh, but these are executive actions, you say? The court will have more respect for a health-and-safety act of Congress, you imagine? Well, let me remind you of the granddaddy of all congressional health-and-safety actions: the Affordable Care Act. People think of National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius as the 2015 case where Roberts \"saved\" Obamacare, but let's remember what really happened there. On a far less extremist court, there were five votes-including one by Roberts-to invalidate the ACA as an unconstitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. The trick Roberts used to save the law was to convert the ACA from a regulatory action of Congress into a tax. It was a brilliant bit of legal obfuscation that has given Roberts his undeserved reputation of being a moderate. But make no mistake: At the beating heart of NFIB is a shocking denial of congressional authority to regulate the standard of health care that must be provided in the various states. Conservative justices barely allowed Congress to pass a minimum level of insurance coverage , but now we're supposed to believe they will let the federal government force states to provide abortions? Have you met these people? Speaking about who these people are in real life, I haven't even mentioned that these conservatives are actively trying to usher in a fundamentalist Christian theocracy and force the rest of us to live in it. The religious views of justices like Samuel Alito, alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barret are already on the record. But people forget that Roberts's wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, was a fierce forced-birth advocate before she pulled back on her public life to avoid the appearance of impropriety with Roberts on the court. People do remember that Clarence Thomas, and his wife, hold the same views and don't care about the appearance of corruption.

It was a brilliant bit of legal obfuscation that has given Roberts his undeserved reputation of being a moderate. But make no mistake: At the beating heart of NFIB is a shocking denial of congressional authority to regulate the standard of health care that must be provided in the various states. Conservative justices barely allowed Congress to pass a minimum level of insurance coverage , but now we're supposed to believe they will let the federal government force states to provide abortions? Have you met these people? Speaking about who these people are in real life, I haven't even mentioned that these conservatives are actively trying to usher in a fundamentalist Christian theocracy and force the rest of us to live in it. The religious views of justices like Samuel Alito, alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barret are already on the record. But people forget that Roberts's wife, Jane Sullivan Roberts, was a fierce forced-birth advocate before she pulled back on her public life to avoid the appearance of impropriety with Roberts on the court. People do remember that Clarence Thomas, and his wife, hold the same views and don't care about the appearance of corruption. That's five justices whose personal views, I believe, prevent them from ever allowing the government to protect the rights of women and pregnant people, law be damned (see their ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization for more evidence). The sixth conservative, Neil Gorsuch, barely suffers the federal government to exist. The only potential hope that abortion protections might survive this Supreme Court lies in the justices' recognition of the political gravity of their position. The justices can read exit polls, same as the rest of us. Roberts likes to deliver electorally justifiable rulings to the Republicans. Kavanaugh is so desperate to be treated by the media like Roberts gets treated that you can almost smell it on him. If they read the tea leaves, there's at least a very small chance that they would uphold national abortion protections because that would be the only way to help the Republican Party. A watered-down, bare-minimum version of abortion protections (the only kind \"Democrats\" like Joe Manchin would ever vote for in an election year), with exceptions for rape and incest, largely takes the issue off the table for the upcoming presidential election cycle. Moreover, if the court were to strike down such a bill, it would only increase the calls for Democrats to expand the court, something we know the conservatives currently looking forward to holding 30 years of unaccountable power do not want. If the GOP were a functional political party, it would jump at this chance to appear reasonable; Republicans in Congress would release their vulnerable colleagues to support Roe v. Wade ; McConnell would muster up nine or 10 votes in the Senate to obviate calls to end the filibuster; and Roberts would find some way to make it all work. But they won't do these things, because conservatives are not in a political party; they're in an ideological cult. Understanding this is key to understanding why the Supreme Court will never allow a law protecting abortion rights to exist, so long as conservatives hold the balance of power. Democrats should force the issue anyway. The more people see what this extremist court does, the more people will be willing to stop them.\n\nConservative justices barely allowed Congress to pass a minimum level of insurance coverage , but now we're supposed to believe they will let the federal government force states to provide abortions?

Jackson Women's Health Organization . At issue is a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of gestation in explicit defiance of Roe , which protects abortion rights until around 24 weeks. Why hand the Democrats an issue that has worked well for them in purple states like Virginia? An attempt in 2012 to force women seeking abortions to have transvaginal ultrasounds backfired against Republicans so powerfully the state is now entirely under Democratic control. Despite Roe , states where antichoicers are strong have succeeded in drastically limiting abortion access by passing measures that force clinics to close-six have only one-and heap up obstacles that keep women from accessing abortions in time. As it has done with voting rights , the court can effectively gut Roe while leaving it formally in place. In fact, it tried in 1992, when Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey replaced Roe 's trimester framework with the concept of \"viability\" and permitted pre-viability restrictions as long as they didn't constitute an \"undue burden,\" whatever that is. Shrewd politics isn't everything, though. There's also religious and personal conviction-Justices Thomas, Alito, Roberts, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are longtime abortion opponents. And political calculations can cut both ways: Maybe five out of nine think it's past time to reward the powerful antiabortion movement, for which the end of Roe is the holy grail. Why, after all, did the court take the Mississippi case if not to use it to abandon Roe ? The case isn't even shielded with the fig leaf of \"women's health\"-it explicitly calls on the court to overturn Roe in the name of pre-viable fetuses. Most political mavens think the court will leave Roe standing. But some say overturning Roe won't be so bad. It will wake up the pro-choice majority. It will force anti­abortion legislators to back off the extreme bills they rely on the courts to set aside. If they had to live with the real-life consequences of their votes, they'd think twice, goes the theory. I'm not so sure. As we've seen with vaccine refusals, the rise of QAnon, the backlash against critical race theory, and numerous other issues, reason can be helpless against demagoguery and paranoia and lies. The antichoice movement has invented plenty of its own facts: You can't get pregnant from rape, abortion is never medically necessary, it's genocide against Black people, and so on. Who's to say reality will carry the day on abortion? If Roe goes, abortion will immediately become illegal in 10 states. ( As of November, Oklahoma will make it 11. ) As in the years immediately preceding Roe, when a few states had already liberalized their laws, the US will be a house divided. But otherwise, post- Roe won't be like pre- Roe . In one way that will be all to the good: When it comes to illegal abortion, pills are much safer than coat hangers and knitting needles or a visit to a Mafia-connected \"doctor.\" Misoprostol, an ulcer medication that is one-half of the abortion pill regime and is 80 to 85 percent effective on its own, is available on the Internet and can be bought over the counter in Mexico. It's already in wide use in countries where abortion is illegal. (The other half, mifepristone, is tightly controlled, but if abortion goes underground that could change.) It will not be easy for police in antiabortion states to shut a black market in misoprostol down.

During the entire century or more that abortion was illegal in the United States, hardly any women went to prison for ending their pregnancies. They were subpoenaed to testify against their abortion provider, they were humiliated in court, they were hounded while dying in their hospital beds by police officers looking to identify the provider, but they were not themselves put on trial. Mothers, friends, boyfriends, husbands, and others who helped with money or arrangements or transportation were left alone. Unless there was a death or serious injury, few providers were arrested. Current Issue View our current issue This time around will be different. When abortion was illegal, there was no organized, aggressive antiabortion movement with a wing of violent fanatics. The language of fetal personhood and fetal rights was much less developed. Abortion was wrong, but the rationale was as much or more about enforcing female chastity and promoting marriage and childbirth as it was about baby killing. That's why, until the 1960s, it was only a misdemeanor. Today, the only argument left standing is that fertilized eggs and fetuses are persons, and abortion is homicide. That has raised the emotional stakes so high it is hard to explain why a woman should not be prosecuted or why the friend who drives her to the clinic is not an accessory. Even now, although a medical abortion looks exactly like a natural miscarriage, there have been cases of women being arrested after going to the ER with excessive bleeding-there are a lot of antiabortion people who work in hospitals-or after they confide in the wrong sister or friend or roommate. That thinking is behind Texas's Senate Bill 8 , which Governor Greg Abbott signed into law in May. It bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, at around six weeks of gestation-when many women don't even know they are pregnant. In addition, instead of leaving enforcement to the state, the law empowers private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion after that point-a clinic or the friend sitting with her in the waiting room. No connection is required between the citizen and the abortion, so anyone can sue: a nosy neighbor or a random antiabortion activist, the kind of person who takes down license numbers in a clinic parking lot. There's money in it too-up to $10,000 if the suit is successful. That this bill was a top priority of Texas Republicans tells you everything you need to know about the GOP and its famous \"base.\" Overturning Roe will invite more and more of this kind of madness.

But some say overturning Roe won't be so bad. It will wake up the pro-choice majority. It will force anti­abortion legislators to back off the extreme bills they rely on the courts to set aside. If they had to live with the real-life consequences of their votes, they'd think twice, goes the theory. I'm not so sure. As we've seen with vaccine refusals, the rise of QAnon, the backlash against critical race theory, and numerous other issues, reason can be helpless against demagoguery and paranoia and lies. The antichoice movement has invented plenty of its own facts: You can't get pregnant from rape, abortion is never medically necessary, it's genocide against Black people, and so on. Who's to say reality will carry the day on abortion? If Roe goes, abortion will immediately become illegal in 10 states. ( As of November, Oklahoma will make it 11. ) As in the years immediately preceding Roe, when a few states had already liberalized their laws, the US will be a house divided.

It's already in wide use in countries where abortion is illegal. (The other half, mifepristone, is tightly controlled, but if abortion goes underground that could change.)

Fetal viability is the point after which a fetus is thought to have a chance of surviving outside a woman's body, thus giving the government a legitimate state interest in the health and well-being of the fetus separate and apart from the parent. Fetal viability is believed to take place around 23 to 24 weeks. Forced-birth activists have been incredibly successful at whittling away a pregnant woman's right to bodily autonomy before fetal viability. And they've been incredibly successful at making it hard for women to access their rights-with the help of abortion providers and drugs-during the brief window many states will still allow them to have any. But fetal viability is more or less the legal line in the sand and has been since the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Before her fetus reaches viability, a pregnant woman is to be treated as a fully formed human being. After viability, Republican-controlled states are allowed to treat her as a malfunctioning incubator who can be forced to serve the state's alleged interests against her free will. But that arrangement has never satisfied conservatives. They have consistently sought to take away the possibility of autonomous choice earlier and earlier in the gestation process. For some conservatives, the ones who argue against making the \"morning-after pill\" available, a woman loses her right to her own body the moment she has sex. Given that those conservatives also tend to be against giving women access to contraceptives, their real game is taking away a woman's autonomy the moment she even thinks about having sex. Still other conservatives make no exception for rape and thus take away a woman's autonomy the moment somebody else forces themselves upon her. To exercise their ultimate control over women's bodies, forced-birth activists have always needed to control one particular branch of government: the judiciary-in particular, the Supreme Court. Now, they do. The replacement of Anthony Kennedy, a reluctant supporter of basic autonomy, with alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and the replacement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg with noted forced-birth proponent Amy Coney Barrett, has given conservatives a clear 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. For the first time since Roe v. Wade was handed down, conservatives have the votes to overturn it. The frontal attack will come next year. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . At issue in the case is the very concept of fetal viability. Mississippi passed a law in 2018 outlawing abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, except in cases of medical emergency or \"severe fetal abnormality.\" There is no exception for cases of rape or incest.

Casey . Mississippi's law is unconstitutional on its face. That's not just me saying that. Mississippi's law was challenged by the state's only licensed abortion provider, the Jackson Women's Health Organization, which won its case in federal district court. The case then made its way to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the notoriously conservative circuit court that oversees Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. There, the Mississippi law was thrown out on a rail. Even the Trump-appointed conservative ideologue Judge James C. Ho concurred with the majority ruling from Judge Patrick Higginbotham (himself a Ronald Reagan appointee) that the law was unconstitutional. Ho wrote separately to make the usual conservative arguments in favor of forced birth, but reluctantly had to admit that Supreme Court precedent was clear on the issue: Fetal viability is the line the government cannot cross. Current Issue View our current issue The only court that can overturn Supreme Court precedent is the Supreme Court. The fact that the court has taken the case is a pretty good indication that it intends to do just that. Part of the reason we're here is that the liberal legal argument for abortion rights has always been a little weak. Supreme Court precedent has treated abortion as a \"balancing test\" between the rights of women and the allegedly compelling state interest in forcing women to do something they don't want to do. By grounding abortion rights in the right to privacy (a substantive right I believe exists, but one not explicitly spelled out in constitutional text), the court in Roe and Planned Parenthood opened the door for all manner of restrictions to be placed on a woman's right to choose. I'd have decided Roe on straight 14th Amendment equal protection grounds. Men have full control over their reproductive system, so should women, the end. Failing that, I'd have decided Roe on 13th Amendment grounds. Involuntary servitude shall not exist in these United States, so forcing a woman to labor for nine months, for free, when she doesn't want to, because the government thinks she should, is flatly unconstitutional. No balancing required. But we've never done it that way. We've always accepted the lie that the state has a legitimate and compelling interest in forcing women to give birth if they happen to get pregnant after sexual intercourse-regardless of whether that intercourse was consensual. We've acted like forcing people to pass a bowling ball through their genitals is something a legitimate government can compel in the best interests of \"society\" and it's just a question of when and how. All forced-birth activists have ever had to do is chip away at the \"when\" and make it ever easier for the government to exercise its coercion. We'll see, by around this time next year, whether the barbarians finally get their way. If the new justices, Kavanaugh and Barrett, hold fast to Supreme Court precedent (as they promised to do during their confirmation hearings), they will reject this Mississippi law, and in so doing reframe the abortion debate. An opinion in defense of precedent will signal to forced-birth advocates that attacking fetal viability is a no-go. Or the new justices could go the other way. They could prove that they were lying during their confirmation hearings and strike down the fetal viability standard as they were sent to the Supreme Court to do. The latter is far more likely. Conservatives have been trying to take away women's autonomy through a thousand cuts. But now they have the votes to use a chain saw.\n\nForced-birth activists have been incredibly successful at whittling away a pregnant woman's right to bodily autonomy before fetal viability.

Ho wrote separately to make the usual conservative arguments in favor of forced birth, but reluctantly had to admit that Supreme Court precedent was clear on the issue: Fetal viability is the line the government cannot cross. Current Issue View our current issue The only court that can overturn Supreme Court precedent is the Supreme Court. The fact that the court has taken the case is a pretty good indication that it intends to do just that. Part of the reason we're here is that the liberal legal argument for abortion rights has always been a little weak. Supreme Court precedent has treated abortion as a \"balancing test\" between the rights of women and the allegedly compelling state interest in forcing women to do something they don't want to do. By grounding abortion rights in the right to privacy (a substantive right I believe exists, but one not explicitly spelled out in constitutional text), the court in Roe and Planned Parenthood opened the door for all manner of restrictions to be placed on a woman's right to choose. I'd have decided Roe on straight 14th Amendment equal protection grounds. Men have full control over their reproductive system, so should women, the end. Failing that, I'd have decided Roe on 13th Amendment grounds. Involuntary servitude shall not exist in these United States, so forcing a woman to labor for nine months, for free, when she doesn't want to, because the government thinks she should, is flatly unconstitutional. No balancing required. But we've never done it that way. We've always accepted the lie that the state has a legitimate and compelling interest in forcing women to give birth if they happen to get pregnant after sexual intercourse-regardless of whether that intercourse was consensual. We've acted like forcing people to pass a bowling ball through their genitals is something a legitimate government can compel in the best interests of \"society\" and it's just a question of when and how. All forced-birth activists have ever had to do is chip away at the \"when\" and make it ever easier for the government to exercise its coercion. We'll see, by around this time next year, whether the barbarians finally get their way. If the new justices, Kavanaugh and Barrett, hold fast to Supreme Court precedent (as they promised to do during their confirmation hearings), they will reject this Mississippi law, and in so doing reframe the abortion debate. An opinion in defense of precedent will signal to forced-birth advocates that attacking fetal viability is a no-go. Or the new justices could go the other way. They could prove that they were lying during their confirmation hearings and strike down the fetal viability standard as they were sent to the Supreme Court to do. The latter is far more likely. Conservatives have been trying to take away women's autonomy through a thousand cuts. But now they have the votes to use a chain saw.\n\nBut that arrangement has never satisfied conservatives. They have consistently sought to take away the possibility of autonomous choice earlier and earlier in the gestation process. For some conservatives, the ones who argue against making the \"morning-after pill\" available, a woman loses her right to her own body the moment she has sex. Given that those conservatives also tend to be against giving women access to contraceptives, their real game is taking away a woman's autonomy the moment she even thinks about having sex. Still other conservatives make no exception for rape and thus take away a woman's autonomy the moment somebody else forces themselves upon her. To exercise their ultimate control over women's bodies, forced-birth activists have always needed to control one particular branch of government: the judiciary-in particular, the Supreme Court. Now, they do. The replacement of Anthony Kennedy, a reluctant supporter of basic autonomy, with alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, and the replacement of Ruth Bader Ginsburg with noted forced-birth proponent Amy Coney Barrett, has given conservatives a clear 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. For the first time since Roe v. Wade was handed down, conservatives have the votes to overturn it. The frontal attack will come next year. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . At issue in the case is the very concept of fetal viability. Mississippi passed a law in 2018 outlawing abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, except in cases of medical emergency or \"severe fetal abnormality.\" There is no exception for cases of rape or incest.

They could prove that they were lying during their confirmation hearings and strike down the fetal viability standard as they were sent to the Supreme Court to do. The latter is far more likely. Conservatives have been trying to take away women's autonomy through a thousand cuts. But now they have the votes to use a chain saw.\n\nOr the new justices could go the other way.

      "text": "We're Not Going Back to the Time Before Roe. We're Going Somewhere Worse\n\nIn the weeks since a draft of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization-a case about a Mississippi law that bans abortion after fifteen weeks, with some health-related exceptions but none for rape or incest- was leaked , a slogan has been revived: \"We won't go back.\" It has been chanted at marches, defiantly but also somewhat awkwardly, given that this is plainly an era of repression and regression , in which abortion rights are not the only rights disappearing. Now that the Supreme Court has issued its final decision, overturning Roe v. Wade and removing the constitutional right to abortion, insuring that abortion will become illegal or highly restricted in twenty states, the slogan sounds almost divorced from reality-an indication, perhaps, of how difficult it has become to comprehend the power and the right-wing extremism of the current Supreme Court.\n\nSupport for abortion has never been higher , with more than two-thirds of Americans in favor of retaining Roe, and fifty-seven per cent affirming a woman's right to abortion for any reason. Even so, there are Republican officials who have made it clear that they will attempt to pass a federal ban on abortion if and when they control both chambers of Congress and the Presidency. Anyone who can get pregnant must now face the reality that half of the country is in the hands of legislators who believe that your personhood and autonomy are conditional-who believe that, if you are impregnated by another person, under any circumstance, you have a legal and moral duty to undergo pregnancy, delivery, and, in all likelihood, two decades or more of caregiving, no matter the permanent and potentially devastating consequences for your body, your heart, your mind, your family, your ability to put food on the table, your plans, your aspirations, your life.\n\nNew Yorker writers answer questions about what comes next for reproductive rights .\n\n\"We won't go back\"-it's an inadequate rallying cry, prompted only by events that belie its message. But it is true in at least one sense. The future that we now inhabit will not resemble the past before Roe, when women sought out illegal abortions and not infrequently found death. The principal danger now lies elsewhere, and arguably reaches further. We have entered an era not of unsafe abortion but of widespread state surveillance and criminalization-of pregnant women, certainly, but also of doctors and pharmacists and clinic staffers and volunteers and friends and family members, of anyone who comes into meaningful contact with a pregnancy that does not end in a healthy birth. Those who argue that this decision won't actually change things much-an instinct you'll find on both sides of the political divide-are blind to the ways in which state-level anti-abortion crusades have already turned pregnancy into punishment, and the ways in which the situation is poised to become much worse.\n\nIn the states where abortion has been or will soon be banned, any pregnancy loss past an early cutoff can now potentially be investigated as a crime. Search histories, browsing histories, text messages, location data, payment data, information from period-tracking apps-prosecutors can examine all of it if they believe that the loss of a pregnancy may have been deliberate. Even if prosecutors fail to prove that an abortion took place, those who are investigated will be punished by the process, liable for whatever might be found.\n\nFive years ago, Latice Fisher, a Black mother of three from Mississippi, who made eleven dollars an hour as a police-radio operator, experienced a stillbirth, at roughly thirty-six weeks, at home. When questioned, she acknowledged that she didn't want more kids and couldn't afford to take care of more kids. She surrendered her phone to investigators, who scraped it for search data and found search terms regarding mifepristone and misoprostol, i.e., abortion pills .\n\nThese pills are among the reasons that we are not going back to the era of coat hangers. They can be prescribed via telemedicine and delivered via mail ; allowing for the prescription of an extra dose, they are ninety-five to ninety-eight per cent effective in cases of pregnancy up to eleven weeks, which account for almost ninety per cent of all abortions in the U.S. Already, more than half of all abortions in the country are medication abortions. In nineteen states, doctors are prohibited from providing abortions via telemedicine, but women can seek help from clinicians in other states and abroad , such as Rebecca Gomperts, who leads Aid Access, an organization based in Austria that is openly providing abortion pills to women in prohibition states, and has been safely mailing abortion pills to pregnant people all over the world since 2005, with the organization Women on Web. In advance of the U.S. bans, Gomperts has been promoting advance prescription : sympathetic doctors might prescribe abortion pills for any menstruating person, removing some of the fears-and, possibly, the traceability-that would come with attempting to get the pills after pregnancy. Misoprostol can be prescribed for other issues, such as stomach ulcers, and Gomperts argues that there is no reasonable medical argument against advance prescription. \"If you buy bleach in the supermarket, that's more dangerous,\" she has said.\n\nThere was no evidence that Latice Fisher took an abortion pill. She maintained that she had experienced a stillbirth-an occurrence in one out of every hundred and sixty pregnancies in the U.S. Nonetheless, she was charged with second-degree murder and held for several weeks on a hundred-thousand-dollar bond. The district attorney, Scott Colom, had campaigned as a progressive reformer; advocates pushed him to drop the murder charge, and to provide a new grand jury with information about an antiquated, unreliable \"float test\" that had been used as a basis for the allegation that Fisher's baby was born alive. The grand jury declined to indict Fisher again; the ordeal took more than three years.\n\nEven if it remains possible in prohibition states to order abortion pills, doing so will be unlawful. (Missouri recently proposed classifying the delivery or shipment of these pills as drug trafficking . Louisiana just passed a law that makes mailing abortion pills to a resident of the state a criminal offense, punishable by six months' imprisonment.) In many states, to avoid breaking the law, a woman would have to drive to a state where abortion is legal, have a telemedicine consultation there, and then receive the pills in that state. Many women in Texas have opted for a riskier but easier option: to drive across the border , to Mexico, and get abortion pills from unregulated pharmacies, where pharmacists may issue incorrect advice for usage. Some women who lack the freedom and money to travel out of state, and who might fear the consequences of seeking a clinical confirmation of their gestational stage, will order abortion pills without a clear understanding of how far along they are in pregnancy. Abortion pills are safe and effective, but patients need access to clinical guidance and follow-up care. Women in prohibition states who want to seek medical attention after a self-managed abortion will, as a rule, have to choose between risking their freedom and risking their health.\n\nBoth abortion and miscarriage currently occur more than a million times each year in America, and the two events are often clinically indistinguishable . Because of this, prohibition states will have a profoundly invasive interest in differentiating between them. Some have already laid the groundwork for establishing government databases of pregnant women likely to seek abortions. Last year, Arkansas passed a law called the Every Mom Matters Act , which requires women considering abortion to call a state hotline and requires abortion providers to register all patients in a database with a unique I.D. Since then, six other states have implemented or proposed similar laws. The hotlines are provided by crisis pregnancy centers : typically Christian organizations, many of which masquerade as abortion clinics, provide no health care, and passionately counsel women against abortion. Crisis pregnancy centers are already three times as numerous as abortion clinics in the U.S., and, unlike hospitals, they are not required to protect the privacy of those who come to them. For years, conservative states have been redirecting money , often from funds earmarked for poor women and children, toward these organizations. The data that crisis pregnancy centers are capable of collecting-names, locations, family details, sexual and medical histories, non-diagnostic ultrasound images-can now be deployed against those who seek their help.\n\nIf you become pregnant, your phone generally knows before many of your friends do. The entire Internet economy is built on meticulous user tracking of purchases and search terms. Laws modelled on Texas's S.B. 8 , which encourages private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who facilitates an abortion, will proliferate, giving self-appointed vigilantes no shortage of tools to track and identify suspects. (The National Right to Life Committee recently published policy recommendations for anti-abortion states that included criminal penalties for anyone who provides information about self-managed abortion \"over the telephone, the internet, or any other medium of communication.\") A reporter for Vice recently spent a mere hundred and sixty dollars to purchase a data set on visits to more than six hundred Planned Parenthood clinics. Brokers sell data that make it possible to track journeys to and from any location-say, an abortion clinic in another state. In Missouri, this year, a lawmaker proposed a measure that would allow private citizens to sue anyone who helps a resident of the state get an abortion elsewhere; as with S.B. 8, the law would reward successful plaintiffs with ten thousand dollars. The closest analogue to this kind of legislation is the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793.\n\nFor now, the targets of S.B. 8-type bounty laws are those who provide abortions, not those who seek them. But that seems likely to change. Connecticut, a progressive state on the matter of abortion, recently passed a law that prevents local agencies from coöperating with out-of-state abortion prosecutions and protects the medical records of out-of-state clients. Other progressive states will follow suit. If prohibition states can't sue out-of-state doctors, and, if abortion pills sent by mail remain largely undetectable, the only people left to target will be abortion advocates and those trying to get abortions. The Stream, a conservative Christian publication, recently advocated mandatory psychiatric custody for women who get abortions. In May, Louisiana advanced a bill that would allow abortion patients to be charged with murder. The proposal was withdrawn, but the threat had been made.\n\nThe theological concept of fetal personhood-the idea that, from the moment of conception, an embryo or fetus is a full human being, deserving of equal (or, more accurately, superior) rights-is a foundational doctrine of the anti-abortion movement. The legal ramifications of this idea -including the possible classification of I.V.F., IUDs, and the morning-after pill as instruments of murder-are unhinged , and much harsher than what even the average anti-abortion American is currently willing to embrace. Nonetheless, the anti-abortion movement is now openly pushing for fetal personhood to become the foundation of U.S. abortion law.\n\nIf a fetus is a person, then a legal framework can be invented to require someone who has one living inside her to do everything in her power to protect it, including-as happened to Savita Halappanavar , in Ireland, which operated under a fetal-personhood doctrine until 2018, and to Izabela Sajbor, in Poland, where all abortion is effectively illegal-to die. No other such obligation exists anywhere in our society, which grants cops the freedom to stand by as children are murdered behind an unlocked door. In Poland, pregnant women with cancer have been routinely denied chemotherapy because of clinicians' fears of harming the fetus.\n\nFetal-personhood laws have passed in Georgia and Alabama, and they are no longer likely to be found unconstitutional. Such laws justify a full-scale criminalization of pregnancy, whereby women can be arrested, detained, and otherwise placed under state intervention for taking actions perceived to be potentially harmful to a fetus. This approach has been steadily tested, on low-income minorities in particular, for the past four decades. National Advocates for Pregnant Women-the organization that has provided legal defense for most of the cases mentioned in this article-has documented almost eighteen hundred cases, from 1973 to 2020, of prosecutions or forced interventions related to pregnancy; this is likely a substantial undercount. Even in states such as California, where the law explicitly prohibits charging women with murder after a pregnancy loss, conservative prosecutors are doing so anyway .\n\nMost pregnancy-related prosecutions, so far, have revolved around drug use. Women who used drugs while pregnant, or sought treatment for drug use during pregnancy, have been charged with child abuse, child neglect, distribution of drugs to a minor, assault with a deadly weapon, manslaughter, and homicide. In 2020, law enforcement in Alabama investigated a woman named Kim Blalock for chemical endangerment of a child after she told delivery-room staff that she had been taking prescribed hydrocodone for pain management. (The district attorney charged her with prescription fraud-a felony-before eventually dropping the prosecution altogether.) There has been a string of shocking recent prosecutions in Oklahoma, in which women who used drugs have been charged with manslaughter for miscarrying well before the point of viability. In Wisconsin, state law already allows juvenile courts to take a fetus-meaning a pregnant woman-into custody for the fetus's protection, resulting in the detention and forced treatment of more than four hundred pregnant women every year on the suspicion that they may be consuming controlled substances. A proposed law in Wyoming would create a specific category of felony child endangerment for drug use while pregnant, a law that resembles Tennessee's former Fetal Assault Law. The Tennessee law was discontinued after two years, because treating women as adversaries to the fetuses they carry has a chilling effect on prenatal medicine, and inevitably results in an increase in maternal and infant death.\n\nThe mainstream pro-choice movement has largely ignored the growing criminalization of pregnancy, just as it has generally ignored the inadequacy of Roe. (It took Joe Biden, who campaigned on making Roe the \"law of the land,\" more than a year to say the word \"abortion\" on the record after he became President; the Democrats, given the chance to override the filibuster and codify Roe in May, predictably failed to do so.) Many of those who support the right to abortion have tacitly accepted that poor and minority women in conservative states lost access to abortion long before this Supreme Court decision, and have quietly hoped that the thousands of women facing arrest after pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or even healthy deliveries were unfortunate outliers. They were not outliers, and, as the columnist Rebecca Traister noted last month, the chasm between the impervious class and everyone else is growing every day.\n\nPregnancy is more than thirty times more dangerous than abortion. One study estimates that a nationwide ban would lead to a twenty-one-per-cent rise in pregnancy-related deaths. Some of the women who will die from abortion bans are pregnant right now. Their deaths will come not from back-alley procedures but from a silent denial of care: interventions delayed, desires disregarded. They will die of infections, of preëclampsia, of hemorrhage, as they are forced to submit their bodies to pregnancies that they never wanted to carry, and it will not be hard for the anti-abortion movement to accept these deaths as a tragic, even noble, consequence of womanhood itself.\n\nIn the meantime, abortion bans will hurt, disable, and endanger many people who want to carry their pregnancies to term but who encounter medical difficulties. Physicians in prohibition states have already begun declining to treat women who are in the midst of miscarriages, for fear that the treatment could be classified as abortion. One woman in Texas was told that she had to drive fifteen hours to New Mexico to have her ectopic pregnancy-which is nonviable, by definition, and always dangerous to the mother-removed. Misoprostol, one of the abortion pills, is routinely prescribed for miscarriage management, because it causes the uterus to expel any remaining tissue. Pharmacists in Texas, fearing legal liability, have already refused to prescribe it . If a miscarriage is not managed to a safe completion, women risk-among other things, and taking the emotional damage for granted-uterine perforation, organ failure, infection, infertility, and death.\n\nMost miscarriages are caused by factors beyond a pregnant person's control: illnesses, placental or uterine irregularities, genetic abnormalities. But the treatment of pregnant people in this country already makes many of them feel directly and solely responsible for the survival of their fetus. They are told to absolutely avoid alcohol, coffee, retinol, deli turkey, unpasteurized cheese, hot baths, vigorous exercise, drugs that are not prescribed to them, drugs that they have been prescribed for years-often without any explanation of the frequently shoddy reasoning behind these prohibitions. Structural factors that clearly increase the likelihood of miscarriage-poverty, environmental-chemical exposure, working night shifts-are less likely to come up. As fetal personhood becomes law in more of the land, pregnant people, as Lynn Paltrow, the director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, has pointed out , \"could be sued, or prevented from engaging in travel, work, or any activity that is believed to create a risk to the life of the unborn.\"\n\nHalf a century ago, the anti-abortion movement was dominated by progressive, antiwar, pro-welfare Catholics. Today, the movement is conservative, evangelical, and absolutely single-minded , populated overwhelmingly by people who, although they may embrace foster care, adoption, and various forms of private ministry, show no interest in pushing for public, structural support for human life once it's left the womb. The scholar Mary Ziegler recently noted that today's anti-abortion advocates see the \"strategies of earlier decades as apologetic, cowardly, and counterproductive.\" During the past four years, eleven states have passed abortion bans that contain no exceptions for rape or incest, a previously unthinkable extreme.\n\nIn Texas, already, children aged nine, ten, and eleven , who don't yet understand what sex and abuse are, face forced pregnancy and childbirth after being raped. Women sitting in emergency rooms in the midst of miscarriages are being denied treatment for sepsis because their fetuses' hearts haven't yet stopped. People you'll never hear of will spend the rest of their lives trying and failing, agonizingly, in this punitive country , to provide stability for a first or fifth child they knew they weren't equipped to care for.\n\nIn the face of all this, there has been so much squeamishness, even in the pro-choice camp: a tone that casts abortion as an unfortunate necessity; an approach to messaging which values choice but devalues abortion care itself, which emphasizes reproductive rights rather than reproductive justice. That approach has landed us here. We are not going back to the pre-Roe era, and we should not want to go back to the era that succeeded it, which was less bitter than the present but was never good enough. We should demand more, and we will have to. We will need to be full-throated and unconditional about abortion as a necessary precondition to justice and equal rights if we want even a chance of someday getting somewhere better. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article inaccurately described aspects of the legal process concerning Latice Fisher's case.\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The End of Roe v. Wade: What You Need to Know About Abortion Access\n\nThis piece originally appeared in our Daily newsletter. Sign up to receive the best of The New Yorker every day in your in-box.\n\nIn a decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade , which established a constitutional right to abortion, in 1973. The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, echoed a draft that was leaked at the beginning of May.\n\nThe ruling is expected to create a stark divide within the country, with residents of more liberal states retaining the right to abortion and those in conservative states largely losing it. Abortion will be immediately illegal or severely restricted in as many as twenty states, affecting an estimated twenty-five million women of childbearing age. Twenty states-along with the District of Columbia-where roughly twenty-six million women of reproductive age reside, will continue to protect abortion rights.\n\nThe ruling is also expected to profoundly affect public perceptions of the Supreme Court. Opinion polls show that a majority of Americans oppose the overturning of Roe. It will also spark an intense political battle, as Democrats push to make the decision a central issue in the midterm elections . The decision could also kick off further political activism from the right. The ruling marks \"the culmination of a half-century-long legal campaign singularly focussed on that outcome,\" the law professor and New Yorker contributor Jeannie Suk Gersen writes. \"And there are signs that, far from being an end in itself, it would launch even more ambitious agendas.\"\n\nWhat will the future of reproductive rights in the United States look like, and what will the political impact of the decision be? Our writers offer answers to urgent questions following today's ruling.\n\nHow will people in states where abortion is outlawed seek care?\n\nEven before the end of Roe, people have been forced to travel significant distances to obtain care. Stephania Taladrid follows the arduous and expensive journey of a fourteen-year-old girl named Laura , who, because of the Texas Heartbeat Act, is forced to travel seven hundred miles with her family from Dallas to New Mexico, to visit what is likely to become among the last remaining abortion clinics in the Southwest. In a dispatch from Illinois, which has been a safe harbor for abortion, Peter Slevin writes about health centers rushing to accomodate a growing number of medical migrants, or \"abortion refugees.\" And although abortion pills, which can be prescribed by phone or video, offer a path for people who can't travel, several states have already imposed restrictions on them.\n\nWhat will conservative activists target next?\n\nJeannie Suk Gersen writes that the overturning of Roe will \"almost certainly fuel the broader fight to get fundamental moral issues out of the realm of federal constitutional rights and under the control of the states.\" This effort might target same-sex marriage and other L.G.B.T.Q. rights, contraception, and more.\n\nWhy were Alito and his fellow-originalists unable to find any legal basis for abortion in the Constitution?\n\nThe \"opinion rests almost exclusively on a bizarre and impoverished historical analysis,\" Jill Lepore notes . It's not just abortion that the Constitution fails to consider. \"There is nothing in that document-or in the circumstances under which it was written-that suggests its authors imagined women as part of the political community embraced by the phrase 'We the People,' \" Lepore writes, and adds that, \"to use a history of discrimination to deny people their constitutional rights is a perversion of logic and a betrayal of justice.\"\n\nHow did the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, get to this point?\n\n\"Since originalists maintain that a right to abortion can't be inferred from the Constitution, the goals of an originalist and an opponent of legal abortion often dovetail conveniently,\" Margaret Talbot writes , in a profile of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose \"personal views on abortion are no mystery.\" In 2006, Barrett \"signed her name to a newspaper ad that declared it 'time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.' \" And in December, 2021, during oral hearings for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Barrett's questioning focussed on whether abortion was necessary, given \"safe haven\" laws that allow a person who has just given birth to leave the baby at a fire station or another designated spot.\n\nWhat are other possible collateral effects of the decision?\n\n\"Every year, there are about a million miscarriages in the United States. Under the doctrine of fetal personhood, these common, complicated, and profoundly intimate losses could become legally subject to surveillance and criminalization,\" Jia Tolentino writes , about how overturning Roe may strengthen the fight by anti-abortion groups for fetal personhood on the state and federal levels.\n\nWho will decide whether the \"life of the mother\" is threatened?\n\nTwenty-six states are likely to criminalize abortion, and as many as twenty-two states are likely to enforce felony bans, Jessica Winter writes . These typically include a \"life of the mother\" exception, but the language of these exceptions varies, and questions such as \"What constitutes an 'emergency'? How does one define 'substantial' or 'reasonable'?\" are left unanswered. As one doctor says, \"Do I have to watch the patient bleed to death? Do I have to call a lawyer before I save her life?\"\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

There is already speculation that access to birth control and same-sex marriage could be challenged. \"If people feel panicked about all those things, I wouldn't invalidate that,\" Tolentino says.

      "text": "If Roe v. Wade Is Overturned, What's Next?\n\nIn 2003, when the Supreme Court held, in Lawrence v. Texas, that criminalizing gay sex was unconstitutional, it insisted that the decision had nothing to do with marriage equality. In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, \"Do not believe it.\" Then, in 2013, when the Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman, emphasizing the tradition of letting the states define marriage, Scalia issued another warning, saying that \"no one should be fooled\" into thinking that the Court would leave states free to exclude gay couples from that definition. He was finally proved right two years later, when the reasoning on dignity and equality developed in those earlier rulings led to the Court's holding that the Constitution requires all states to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nJust as rights can unfold and expand, however, they can also retract and constrict in breathtaking ways, pursuing a particular strain of logic one case at a time. In the forthcoming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Court is widely expected to overturn or severely undermine its abortion-rights cases, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In fact, following the comments of the six conservative Justices at the oral arguments in December, the strength of this expectation has spurred state legislative efforts to proceed as if Roe were already gone. A handful of states have passed laws, like the Mississippi law at issue in Dobbs, that ban abortion after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, in violation of precedents establishing that abortion cannot be banned before \"viability,\" at around twenty-four weeks. (On Thursday, Florida became the most recent.) Some of the laws have been blocked by the courts, but, if Mississippi prevails, the states expect to be free to enforce these bans.\n\nAmong the more restrictive bills currently under consideration across the country, more than a dozen emulate the Texas \"heartbeat\" law , which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and allows only private citizens, not state officials, to enforce the ban. That provision insulates the law from being challenged as unconstitutional in federal court. The Supreme Court repeatedly declined to block the Texas ban, but did leave open a possible avenue to challenge it. In March, the Texas Supreme Court closed that avenue.\n\nIdaho became the first state to enact a Texas-inspired law. Idaho's law bans abortion after about six weeks, and allows family members (including a rapist's relatives) of the \"preborn child\" to sue a provider who performs an abortion. The law was passed last month, but Idaho's Supreme Court has temporarily blocked it from taking effect. Missouri has introduced a bill that allows private citizens to sue an out-of-state abortion provider, or even someone who helps transport a person across state lines for an abortion. Wyoming has passed a law that bans most abortions, which will be triggered if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. The boldest effort thus far, though, has been in Oklahoma, a destination for Texans seeking abortions. Two weeks ago, Oklahoma's legislature made it a felony punishable by ten years in prison to perform an abortion except to save a woman's life in a medical emergency. The governor signed the bill last Tuesday; the law is set to go into effect in August.\n\nOverturning Roe would be the culmination of a half-century-long legal campaign singularly focussed on that outcome. And there are signs that, far from being an end in itself, it would launch even more ambitious agendas. In the Dobbs litigation, Mississippi denied that doing away with Roe would cast doubt on other precedents, set between 1965 and 2015, on which Roe rested or which relied on Roe. This series of decisions held that states cannot ban contraceptives, criminalize gay sex, or refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. The state told the Court that those cases are not like Dobbs, because \"none of them involve the purposeful termination of a human life.\" But all of them involve the question of whether states should be able to make laws that affect some of the most intimate aspects of people's lives. In recent weeks, in anticipation of the Dobbs decision, various Republican senators have questioned Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck down a state ban on contraceptives; Obergefell v. Hodges , which required states to recognize same-sex marriage; and even Loving v. Virginia, which invalidated a state anti-miscegenation law. Overturning Roe would almost certainly fuel the broader fight to get fundamental moral issues out of the realm of federal constitutional rights and under the control of the states.\n\nA Supreme Court decision overturning Roe would seek to justify itself on the ground that it allows states to resolve the issue of abortion for themselves, through democratic processes, rather than by having a resolution imposed on them. At that point, it will be tempting to echo Justice Scalia's \"Do not believe it\" warning. Although the legal arguments against Roe have focussed on returning the issue to the states, for five decades the core moral belief against the ruling has been that abortion is the termination of a human life. Last week, a twenty-six-year-old Texas woman was arrested on murder charges, for \"intentionally and knowingly causing the death of an individual by self-induced abortion.\" The prosecutor dismissed the case, saying that the Texas law did not apply to it. But the incident suggested a possible post-Dobbs future, in which states pursue criminal charges against people who have abortions as well as against those who provide them.\n\nIt may also be only a matter of time, if Mississippi prevails, before pro-life legal efforts turn toward getting the Supreme Court to recognize the constitutional rights of the fetus. These efforts would focus on the same part of the Constitution that was previously held to provide the right to abortion, the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" Fetuses are currently not considered to be persons. But Mississippi's brief repeatedly notes the human attributes of the fetus, in utero, and it may be a precursor to future constitutional arguments to the effect that fetal personhood prohibits abortion.\n\nIn the face of such a push, liberals may one day find themselves advocating for leaving the matter to the states, and perhaps even seeking novel methods-like the one Texas concocted-to circumvent federal-court review of state laws protecting abortion access. Whether or not it would take another fifty years or more for a fetal right to unfold, the pro-life legal movement has demonstrated its ability to fight the long fight. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the day that Florida passed a fifteen-week abortion ban.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Next Targets for the Group That Overturned Roe\n\nOn March 15, 2023, two conservative Christian lawyers asked a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, for a ruling that they privately considered an almost impossible long shot. They demanded a nationwide ban on mifepristone, a pill used in half the abortions in America. The drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for more than twenty years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During the pandemic, the agency began allowing prescriptions to be filled by mail, to accommodate social distancing.\n\nBut the lawyers, from a group called Alliance Defending Freedom, were on a winning streak. Founded three decades ago as a legal-defense fund for conservative Christian causes, A.D.F. had become that movement's most influential arm. In the past dozen years, its lawyers had won fourteen Supreme Court victories, including overturning Roe v. Wade; allowing employer-sponsored health insurance to exclude birth control; rolling back limits on government support for religious organizations; protecting the anonymity of donors to advocacy groups; blocking pandemic-related public-health rules; and establishing the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Capitalizing on its success, A.D.F. had tripled its revenue over that period, to more than a hundred million dollars a year. It now had seventy or so in-house lawyers, including the former solicitors general of Michigan and Nebraska and the former United States Attorney for Missouri. The lawyers sent to Amarillo were Erik Baptist, a former top lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump, and Erin Hawley, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, advised the Attorney General under President George W. Bush, and worked on the team that overturned Roe. (She is married to Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri.)\n\nThanks to the rightward shift of the courts under Trump, A.D.F. lawyers now often find a sympathetic audience on the federal bench. Filing the mifepristone case in Amarillo enabled A.D.F. to argue before Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who had previously worked as the deputy general counsel of First Liberty Institute-a conservative Christian advocacy organization that has received grants from A.D.F. The summer before, Kacsmaryk's chambers had chosen an intern from an A.D.F. program for law students; an alumnus of the program is clerking for him this fall. (Other alumni clerked last term for Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.)\n\nMany of the sixty-odd members of A.D.F.'s fund-raising department gathered during the hearing to pray for a win, and, in a video conference the next day, Lance Bauslaugh, A.D.F.'s senior vice-president of development, told the staff that Erin Hawley was \"super grateful.\" Even though the Amarillo judge was \"very friendly,\" Bauslaugh said, upending a decades-old F.D.A. approval was \"a tough thing to do.\" He said of the judge, \"Maybe he gives us half of what we are seeking\"-say, restoring limits on mail-order delivery. That alone would be \"huge.\" (A left-leaning investigative organization called Documented provided me with leaked recordings of the video conference and other events, along with hundreds of pages of internal documents.)\n\nThe hearing itself, Bauslaugh noted, offered \"fund-raising opportunities.\" Donations had been flat lately; Bauslaugh blamed the economy, but surely the reversal of Roe had sapped some donors' motivation. The mifepristone case was plunging A.D.F. back into a galvanizing battle. One of Bauslaugh's lieutenants offered a potential fund-raising pitch: \"If I told you five years ago that you could have invested in Roe being overturned, how much would you have invested in that? If I can tell you now that we are going to protect life even more, how much do you want to invest in that ?\"\n\nBauslaugh framed the case yet more broadly, beyond abortion or even Christianity. Calling it \"a massive pushback on the F.D.A. and the Biden Administration from a regulatory standpoint,\" he noted that there was \"a ton of corruption in the bureaucratic state.\"\n\nIn fact, he explained, A.D.F. was quietly revising its mission altogether, to reflect both the changing times and the group's growing ambitions. Until now, A.D.F. had cast itself as primarily defensive. In the words of one of its founders, its purpose was \"to keep the door open for the Gospel\": to prevent the American Civil Liberties Union and the courts from interfering with Christian ministry, to stop them from removing abortion from the jurisdiction of legislatures, and to keep religion in public life. But A.D.F. leaders often said that the Bible wasn't just for the faithful; it was a universal guide to \"human flourishing.\" Accordingly, Bauslaugh told the fund-raisers, A.D.F. was taking on less explicitly religious concerns, perhaps including \"corruption in the bureaucratic state.\"\n\nAs though to reassure the staff that A.D.F. wasn't abandoning its roots, Bauslaugh kept inserting Biblical references into his explanation. \"Why do we exist as an organization?\" he asked. \"A.D.F. exists to advance our God-given rights to live and speak the truth.\" He paused to let that sink in before adding, \"The truth-the Gospel.\"\n\nFor more than half a century, conservative Christians have decried the left's ever-expanding demands for personal rights. The right to free speech allowed pornography to permeate the culture. The right to freedom of conscience for atheists and religious minorities silenced school prayer. And the right to privacy was stretched to protect birth control, abortion, gay sex, and, eventually, same-sex marriage. In an influential book from 1991, \" Rights Talk ,\" Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor and a conservative Catholic, argued that letting debates over values become all-or-nothing contests about fundamental rights was undermining democracy, by \"turning American political discourse into a parody of itself and challenging the very notion that politics can be conducted through reasoned discussion and compromise.\" Rights talk had become dangerously polarizing.\n\nYet A.D.F. now gushes \"rights talk.\" In fact, Kristen Waggoner, its chief executive and general counsel, sometimes sounds as if she worked for her organization's nemesis, the A.C.L.U. Arguing before the Supreme Court last winter, she told the Justices that she'd come to defend a bedrock First Amendment principle: the right to resist government attempts to coerce a citizen into publicly denying her deepest convictions. She said that she was standing up for a Black sculptor's right to refuse to fabricate a cross for an \"Aryan church rally,\" and for an L.G.B.T. Web designer's right not to promote \"a view of marriage that they don't hold.\" Otherwise, she avoided bringing up sexual orientation or marriage-aside from acknowledging, almost in passing, that her client, Lorie Smith, the owner of 303 Creative, a design studio in Littleton, Colorado, had preëmptively declared that she'd never design a Web site for a same-sex wedding, because such a union \"contradicts\" Scripture.\n\nThe A.D.F. lawyers who filed the mifepristone suit had likewise said that they were arguing for the right to freedom of conscience: their clients were \"pro-life\" doctors in Texas who felt \"complicit\" in a patient's \"elective chemical abortion.\" Emphasizing those rights, the judge surprised the A.D.F. lawyers by granting all their demands, including the unprecedented judicial suspension of a long-standing F.D.A. approval. The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal, and A.D.F. lawyers will likely appear there soon to defend the ruling.\n\nLink copied\n\nWeeks after A.D.F.'s stunning victory in Texas, the Supreme Court found that the Web-site designer's right to free speech overrode a Colorado law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The majority opinion, by Justice Neil Gorsuch, quoted George Orwell's axiom that liberty entails \"the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\"-in this case, to tell a couple that their marriage is sinful.\n\nThough it was A.D.F.'s fifteenth Court victory, Waggoner told me that, aside from overturning Roe, Gorsuch's opinion was \"bigger than anything\" her group had yet achieved. She teared up as she praised the Court's commitment to protecting unpopular speech \"even right now, even in this moment\"-the era of cancel culture.\n\nA.D.F.'s liberal critics invoke Orwell, too. They say that the group's \"rights talk\" is doublespeak for bigotry, patriarchy, and discrimination. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at U.C. Berkeley, told me that A.D.F. \"puts freedom to discriminate over freedom from discrimination.\" Sarah Warbelow, the head of legal advocacy for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay-rights group, told me that A.D.F. was \"hellbent on eradicating L.G.B.T.Q. people from public life.\" A.D.F. is currently asking the Supreme Court to hear its defense of a Christian psychotherapist's right to counsel children and adolescents about how to overcome same-sex attraction-a practice, which L.G.B.T. advocates call \"conversion therapy,\" that many states have outlawed. In 2003, A.D.F. filed an unsuccessful brief to the Court defending the criminalization of gay sodomy, and since then its international affiliates have defended similar laws outside the U.S. (An A.D.F. spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, its affiliates do not litigate to criminalize gay sex; they argue only against the authority of international organizations to impose moral norms on sovereign states.)\n\nOthers accuse A.D.F. of inventing grievances to blow up into causes. Smith, of 303 Creative, told me that her pastor had directed her to speak with A.D.F. before she even entered the business of making Web sites for weddings. And A.D.F. routinely sends out bulletins urging churches and ministries to be on the lookout for \" SOGI s\"-prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. An A.D.F. legal guide warns churches that such prohibitions \"are not designed for the innocent purpose of ensuring all people receive basic services\"; rather, \"their practical effect is to legally compel Christians to accept, endorse, and even promote messages, ideas, and events that violate their faith.\" A.D.F. sometimes resembles a culture-war personal-injury firm; it even solicits clients with a catchy toll-free number, 1-800- TELL-ADF .\n\nThe group has also led the charge against school policies and medical treatments meant to support children or adolescents identifying as transgender. Waggoner told me that, in 2019, A.D.F. initiated the first significant suit opposing the participation of trans athletes in girls' sporting competitions; the case, still ongoing, has helped spark a wider backlash. A.D.F.-which in 2016 established an influence operation aimed at state lawmakers and last year added one focussed on Congress-has helped at least twenty-three states pass legislation barring trans athletes from girls' and women's events. Several states have introduced A.D.F. model legislation requiring schools to get parental consent for any lessons about gender identity; a lawyer affiliated with A.D.F. helped draft a Florida measure that L.G.B.T. advocates call the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. Other states have adopted A.D.F.-drafted legislation restricting gender-transition medical treatment for minors. The organization's lawyers are now representing West Virginia in defending a law, written by A.D.F., that bans trans athletes. (In an internal briefing, the head of its legislative effort said that A.D.F. had \"authored\" at least a hundred and thirty bills in thirty-four states last year; more than thirty were passed into law. In 2018, the organization's lawyers drafted a Mississippi law banning most abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy; last year, A.D.F. successfully defended that law in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe.)\n\nWith only 1.4 per cent of adolescents in the U.S. identifying as transgender, L.G.B.T.-rights groups accuse A.D.F. of whipping up a panic over questions better left to doctors, teachers, and parents. Waggoner, though, told me that A.D.F. was merely reacting to an ominous turn in American life. Her group, she said, had been inundated by complaints from parents about liberal policies regarding trans issues, many of them asking, \"I just learned from the school district that they're calling my daughter by a different name-what can I do?\"\n\nThrough pronoun policies, anti-discrimination statutes, abortion laws, and other impositions of \"sexual ethics,\" Waggoner said, liberal government officials were threatening to set up a new kind of police state-one in which dissenters who believe that marriage can involve only a man and a woman are forced to salute the rainbow flags flying outside every town hall, in which teachers are required to indoctrinate children into the belief that gender is not binary, and in which shelters for battered women must make room for trans females. No wonder that her \"rights talk\" evokes the civil libertarians who once defended the free speech of Communists or neo-Nazis. As Waggoner sees it, traditionalist Christians are now the besieged minority in need of protection. Waggoner told me that the fundamental question was \"Are we going to be a majoritarian-authoritarian system of government? Or are we going to stick with our commitment that the power of persuasion is better than the power of government force?\" She added, \"I would say every single team at A.D.F.-every single litigation team that we have-is working against government censorship.\"\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom was born out of frustration. In 1992, Republicans had held the White House for the previous twelve years. For the first time, Christian conservatives had played a significant role in electing those Presidents, who had installed five of the nine Supreme Court Justices. Nonetheless, the Court that year reaffirmed the right to abortion, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and redoubled the separation of church and state, in Lee v. Weisman, which forbade prayer at school-sponsored events. No matter how many elections conservatives won, liberals always seemed to come out ahead in the courts. So the next year a group of prominent evangelicals-led by James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family-decided to create an endowment to pay for lawyers who could take on the A.C.L.U. and its ilk. They called it Alliance Defense Fund.\n\nTo run it, Dobson and the others turned to Alan Sears, a former federal prosecutor from Kentucky who had risen to prominence as the executive director of a commission on pornography set up during the Reagan Administration. Sears, then in his thirties, had used his platform to urge citizens to help fight the culture wars. With a soft Southern voice, he emphasized in interviews that a chapter of the commission's report laid out how \"citizen action\"-boycotts, picket lines, zoning-board changes-could limit distribution of offensive material, even if it was protected by the First Amendment. \"It's a manual that explains First Amendment rights for both sides,\" Sears explained.\n\nA handful of legal organizations specialized in either religious freedom or Christian cases, but most were run by a single lawyer without enough financial resources for a long-term strategy. A.D.F. would be different: it would begin by raising money and then enlist lawyers. Sears dedicated his life to fund-raising so completely, he told me, that he came to empathize with panhandlers: \"I had a suit, not a sign, but I learned to beg.\"\n\nHe told donors that A.D.F. would follow the litigation strategy of the Black civil-rights movement. Where Thurgood Marshall and the N.A.A.C.P. had set out to overturn the precedents underpinning racial segregation, A.D.F. aimed to undo Roe v. Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the 1971 precedent barring \"excessive entanglement\" of government with religion. Like the N.A.A.C.P., A.D.F. would find sympathetic and strategically placed plaintiffs, then seek conflicting rulings from different circuits in order to push the Supreme Court to take up a question. Along the way, A.D.F. would try to erode precedents that it opposed-for example, by supporting parental-notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n\nA.D.F. officials declined to tell me who its donors are, but others in conservative Christian circles told me that one of the group's mainstays is the family of David Green, which founded the Hobby Lobby crafts chain and the Museum of the Bible, in Washington, D.C. The museum often hosts events for A.D.F., sometimes with speeches by Green family members, and A.D.F. lawyers argued on Hobby Lobby's side of a 2014 Supreme Court case that ended the contraception mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. (Representatives of Hobby Lobby and the museum didn't return calls seeking comment.) Foundations set up by the conservative DeVos and Prince families have also reportedly donated.\n\nCompared with other legal outfits, A.D.F. immediately stood out for the breadth of its aspirations. In 1997, years before Sears could afford in-house litigators, he began sponsoring weeklong conferences around the country to teach lawyers about the group's issues. The attendees formed an expanding network that A.D.F. could call on to provide pro-bono counsel or to help identify promising plaintiffs.\n\nIn 2001, A.D.F. started hiring in-house lawyers and representing its own clients. But Sears continued to give grants to other organizations and firms-even those competing for the same cases. This largesse helped the organization become a hub for conservative Christian donors-they could give to A.D.F. and trust that their money would be spread across the legal battlefield. Sears, who retired in 2017, told me, \"The concept of enabling our allies-we did not do it to raise money, but it really worked.\"\n\nAny interest group raises money more easily when there's a looming threat, and Sears found a perfect villain in the emboldened gay-rights movement. In 2000, Vermont recognized same-sex civil unions, and three years later the Supreme Court found a right to engage in gay sodomy. Sears made fighting gay rights A.D.F.'s third priority, alongside opposing abortion rights and church-state separation. Its lawyers contested the recognition of same-sex marriage in state after state. A.D.F. defended the military's so-called Don't Ask, Don't Tell rule, opposed school speech codes aimed at protecting gay people, helped defend a state-funded Baptist youth center in Kentucky that fired a lesbian therapist, and represented chaplains at a Minnesota women's prison who condemned lesbianism.\n\nIn 2003, when Christian conservatives were pushing state ballot measures and a constitutional amendment to block same-sex marriage, Sears published an anti-gay polemic, \" The Homosexual Agenda .\" Writing with Craig Osten, an A.D.F. communications staffer, Sears professed \"compassion and sensitivity for those ensnared in homosexual behavior,\" but characterized such behavior as a \"disordered,\" pitiable \"condition.\" Sears repeatedly linked homosexuality both to sexually transmitted disease and to the sexual abuse of children. The book relied heavily on a handful of men and women who testified that Christian faith had helped them \"escape\" same-sex attraction. Almost all of those \"ex-gay\" exemplars have since resumed gay or lesbian lives, denouncing conversion therapy and apologizing for promoting it.\n\nIf Sears were writing \"The Homosexual Agenda\" now, he told me, he'd have to make some updates. But he stood by the book's portrait of a plot, hatched by gay-rights activists, to use Hollywood, schools, and the courts to transform American culture. He had sent a lawyer to attend a major L.G.B.T.-activist conference in London, and he had studied gay-rights manifestos like \" After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90's ,\" by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen. Sears said that such activists \"told us what they wanted to do-they said, 'Let's adopt the strategy of the civil-rights movement, let's call ourselves a minority, let's call ourselves oppressed, blah blah blah blah.' \" In hindsight, he said, his book still \"stands pretty well,\" especially the claim of its subtitle-that L.G.B.T. rights are \"the principal threat to religious freedom today.\"\n\nSears was determined to prevent A.D.F. from capitulating to the language of the gay-rights movement. In 2000, he created a summer program, the Blackstone Legal Fellowship, which taught first-year law students conservative Christian thought. The organization sent visiting Blackstone lecturers a \"lexicon,\" which all participants at A.D.F. events were expected to follow. A seven-page version sent out in 2013 included the following:\n\ninstead of \"bigotry, anti-tolerance,\" say \"defending biblical, religious principles\"\n\ninstead of \"homophobia,\" say \"convictions against homosexual behavior\"\n\ninstead of \"hate crimes,\" say \"so-called 'hate' crimes\"\n\ninstead of \"sex education,\" say \"sexual indoctrination\"\n\ninstead of \"gay marriage\" and its \"advocates,\" say \"marriage imitation\" and \"opponents of marriage\"\n\ninstead of \"transgender,\" say \"cross-dressing\" or \"sexually confused\"\n\ninstead of \"gay and lesbian civil rights movement,\" say \"homosexual agenda.\"\n\nOne Blackstone lecturer that summer was Josh Hawley, a law professor from the University of Missouri and the future senator. He received a twenty-five-hundred-dollar stipend. The Riverfront Times , an alternative weekly, used freedom-of-information laws to obtain e-mail correspondence between Hawley and A.D.F., including the lexicon. A spokesperson for the Senator told the publication that he and his wife \"aren't going to apologize for their faith.\"\n\nAnother lecturer that year was Amy Coney Barrett, then a law professor at Notre Dame. She lectured at the program for five summers and received the same lexicon. Yet, during Senate hearings for her 2017 confirmation to an appeals court, she testified that she \"actually wasn't aware\" that A.D.F. had run the program \"until I received the honorarium and saw the A.D.F. on the check, or maybe when I saw an e-mail and saw the signature line.\" She added, implausibly, \"I don't know what all of A.D.F.'s policy positions are. And it has never been my practice to investigate all of the policy positions of a group that invites me to speak.\"\n\nSears's organization, which was renamed the Alliance Defending Freedom in 2012, now has forty-nine hundred lawyers in its network of allies. A.D.F. recruits graduates of Harvard, Yale, and Stanford, and more than half its staff lawyers have done federal clerkships. The Blackstone program, which began with about two dozen students, included nearly two hundred this past summer.\n\nA growing number of Blackstone alumni have clerked for federal judges, and, inevitably, their terms as clerks sometimes have included A.D.F. cases. More than sixty Blackstone alumni are currently clerking on federal courts, including eighteen on appeals courts. The alumnus who is now clerking for the federal district court in Amarillo will next year clerk for the circuit court based in Atlanta, where A.D.F. is defending an Alabama ban on gender-transition treatment for minors. And the two alumni who clerked for Barrett and Alito last session helped them weigh both the 303 Creative case and a Justice Department request to stay the mifepristone ban. (The Court granted the stay-mifepristone remains available for now-but Alito wrote a memorably vituperative dissent.)\n\nLink copied\n\nBarrett's arrival on the Court has locked in a 6-3 conservative majority, and both of Sears's original targets are dead: Roe v. Wade and Lemon v. Kurtzman, the case about enforcing church-state separation. A.D.F. hollowed out Lemon with a series of Supreme Court victories, including one allowing a town council in upstate New York to pray before meetings (2014) and another requiring the State of Missouri to pay to upgrade a Lutheran church's playground (2017). Last year, the Court cited those precedents when it ruled that a public-school football coach in Washington State could lead prayers from the fifty-yard line.\n\nThe group has become so mainstream that last fall, on Capitol Hill, Waggoner teamed up with two prominent Republican congressmen-Jim Jordan, of Ohio, and Steve Scalise, of Louisiana-to host an A.D.F. reception for newly elected lawmakers. The head of A.D.F.'s state-legislative division, J. D. Mesnard, is a state senator in Arizona. And, earlier this year, two federal judges resolved lawsuits in part by ordering litigants to submit to A.D.F. training in the First Amendment-in one case, an hour-long lecture by two A.D.F. lawyers about freedom of expression, from John Stuart Mill through the Red Scare. Three art-therapy professors at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville underwent the training to settle a suit charging that they had discriminated against a conservative Christian student by telling her to stop sharing her beliefs. And a judge in Texas ordered lawyers for Southwest Airlines to receive A.D.F. training as part of the settlement of a suit by a flight attendant who claimed she'd been fired for her opposition to abortion. (Southwest is appealing.)\n\nStill, despite A.D.F.'s many successes, same-sex couples now have a constitutional right to marry. I wondered whether Sears thought A.D.F. was winning or losing. \"We are on a winning trajectory,\" he told me, adding wishfully, \"It may be that the day will come when people say the birth-control pill was a mistake.\"\n\nThe headquarters of A.D.F. is in a leafy campus in Lansdowne, Virginia, about an hour's drive from the Supreme Court. Security is tight. Whenever I arrived for meetings with Waggoner, an armed guard looked me over before letting me in. Once, when I asked to use a men's room, the guard waited outside, apparently to insure that I did not wander off unattended. A.D.F. officials told me that, nearly every day, the group receives at least one threat.\n\nFive feet tall, fifty-one, and blond, Waggoner favors platform heels, skirt suits, and thick silver necklaces. Her office has a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and until recently she had always filled her workspace with Disney memorabilia. \"Just Mickey and Minnie-sort of the classics,\" she told me. A mother of three, she has often visited Disney parks, and even run marathons through them, but she told me that the Walt Disney Company's recent defense of L.G.B.T. rights has \"ruined the beauty.\" The Disney tchotchkes are gone, and on a credenza is a stack of copies of an illustrated children's book, \" She Is She .\" Its authors describe it as a celebration of femininity and motherhood to counter the promotion of nontraditional gender identities. It features a colorful drawing of Waggoner, \"a justice-seeking lawyer.\"\n\nWaggoner is what psychologists call an active listener. She gives empathetic nods and smiles even when she disagrees vehemently with what she is hearing. As I laid out a liberal critique of her cases, she kept smiling while calling what I'd just said \"absolute garbage.\" Lawyers who have faced her in the courtroom say that the corners of her lips seemingly never turn down. Keith Kemper, her former partner in a Seattle law firm, told me that, \"because she has a sweet disposition and a small stature, it is easy to say, 'Oh, here is this nice little girl.' But she is the sweetest killer you ever met.\" A former adversary likened Waggoner's countenance to that of Dolores Umbridge, the cheerfully authoritarian bureaucrat in the \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nWaggoner grew up in Longview, Washington, near the Oregon border, and belongs to the Assemblies of God, the largest Pentecostal denomination-part of a movement defined by speaking in tongues. Her father was the principal of an Assemblies of God school that Waggoner attended, and he later became an associate pastor of the church that ran the school. Waggoner told me that, around the age of thirteen, she felt a sudden calling to become a lawyer and \"defend religious freedom and Christian ministries in schools.\" The culture war of the day was over the teaching of creationism at church schools like her father's, and Waggoner said that, as a girl, she'd been vaguely aware of \"controversies over religious autonomy.\" But she also said that no earthly influence could account for her choice of vocation, given that no conservative Christian legal movement existed at the time. \"I don't know why I felt so strongly, but I am thankful for it,\" she told me. (Waggoner says that she wrote down her calling on a scrap of paper, which she keeps in her bedroom today.) She attended a regional college run by the Assemblies of God and then moved to Virginia Beach to attend Regent University School of Law, a pioneering evangelical law program founded, in 1986, by the Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson. After a clerkship at the Washington State Supreme Court, she practiced for sixteen years at the Seattle firm, which often represented churches.\n\nDuring Sears's tenure, A.D.F. was almost unknown outside conservative Christian circles. Its lawyers viewed mainstream news organizations as hostile, and, like most attorneys, they worried that clients who spoke publicly might undermine their cases. But, during the electoral contests over same-sex marriage, L.G.B.T. activists had won support by presenting the media with sympathetic images of gay and lesbian couples-ordinary-looking people asking for things like hospital-visitation rights. Waggoner, avoiding the forbidden words \"gay marriage\" or \"gay rights,\" told me that A.D.F.'s opponents \"are very good at bringing to bear who's affected if their viewpoint isn't adopted.\" When she took over A.D.F.'s legal strategy, she decided to borrow that playbook and show that conservative Christians could be victims, too-that liberal laws and precedents \"create real harm, that real people are affected, and these people don't have horns. They aren't hateful people.\"\n\nHer test case was Jack Phillips, the owner of a Colorado business called Masterpiece Cakeshop. A ruggedly handsome and ambitiously artful baker, Phillips, who is now sixty-seven, claimed a First Amendment right to refuse to bake a gay couple's wedding cake. In 2017, Waggoner joined him on \"The View,\" ABC's rowdy daytime talk show. Most of the show's five female hosts were noisily liberal, and it was impossible to imagine Sears, the anti-porn crusader, at their table. Waggoner fit right in. Phillips's case was not just about a gay couple, she insisted. \"Jack's dignity is at issue as well,\" she said. One could support same-sex marriage while still supporting \"artists like Jack,\" Waggoner told the hosts, adding, \"If the state can crush Jack, it can crush every single one of us.\"\n\nThe \"View\" hosts grilled them on the Biblical basis for the baker's objection. Didn't the Good Book tell us not to judge? Didn't Jesus \"hang out\" with the lowest of the low? The co-host Joy Behar exclaimed, \"Jesus would have made the cake!\" She then immediately mocked herself for \"speaking for Jesus.\"\n\nWaggoner laughed as deeply as anyone. She must have known that her gambit was working. Chatting with five women citing Scripture and speaking for God, she sounded downright pluralistic. Sunny Hostin, a \"View\" co-host who is also a lawyer and a legal-affairs correspondent, conceded that she now could see \"both sides of this argument,\" adding, \"It is a closer call than I think we are giving credit for.\"\n\nPhillips and Waggoner went on to give six hundred media interviews. A.D.F. launched a team that produced polished videos about its plaintiffs. (Perhaps too polished. The Washington Post recently reported that A.D.F. employees posed as brides in videos promoting three clients who object to filming or photographing gay weddings.) Mainstream-media campaigns became a core part of its repertoire. Waggoner told me, \"Some of the lawyers were having an absolute heart attack. But I said, 'No, you will prep your client, and your client will talk about the case!' \"\n\nIn oral arguments, Waggoner mounted an innovative theory: it might be unlawful discrimination if a baker declined to sell a premade cake to a gay customer, but forcing the baker to design a cake celebrating a gay wedding would constitute constitutionally impermissible \"compelled speech,\" like requiring a St. Patrick's Day parade to allow a gay-pride banner. She told me, \"I have tried to bring to A.D.F. a spirit of offense rather than defense. I'd rather have the A.C.L.U. and Planned Parenthood worried about what we are doing-not the other way around.\"\n\nHumanizing A.D.F.'s clients serves another important purpose-motivating donors-and the organization's revenue has doubled in the five years since Waggoner stepped up its media outreach. According to the leaked video call, donors who give a hundred thousand dollars a year or more were expected to account for more than half A.D.F.'s fund-raising in the past fiscal year-upward of fifty million dollars.\n\nDirect fund-raising-such as telemarketing and TV commercials-was expected to bring in about twenty-seven million dollars. I signed up for A.D.F. e-mails, and they were alarming: \"Government told school to choose between faith and food\"; \"School silences 7th grader.\" But on the video call a staff member told the fund-raisers that A.D.F. wasn't \"trying to provoke fear.\" The goal was to \"communicate what the problem is, and the solution-which is A.D.F.\"\n\nThe fund-raising department's motto is \"We dig ditches.\" On the video call, Keaton Sauncy, a senior fund-raiser, explained that the phrase referred to an Old Testament passage. During a battle with the Moabites, God told the Israelites to catch floodwater in ditches. The Moabites \"see the reflection of the sun in them, and they think it is blood, and they are scared, and they kill themselves, and we win!,\" Sauncy said, somewhat garbling the story. The moral, he said, was that if the fund-raisers do their work \"God is going to bring that rain.\"\n\nLance Bauslaugh, the fund-raising head, told the staff to keep \"that Holy Spirit swagger\" and to think about \"cultivating the remnant\"-a term used in end-time prophecies to describe the few who resist the descent into sin before the apocalypse. He reported that, according to an A.D.F. study, twenty million Americans could be donors. \"Is that part of the remnant?\" he asked.\n\nTalk of ditches full of blood seemed out of step with Waggoner's sunny persona, at first. But, the more we talked, the more I realized that her assessment of what she calls \"the current cultural moment\" is also quite bleak. She repeatedly invoked the case of Päivi Räsänen, a Finnish legislator who is represented by A.D.F.'s international division, which was launched in 2008. Räsänen is fighting hate-crime charges over a social-media post in which she cited a Bible verse and called homosexuality \"dysfunctional,\" a \"disorder,\" and sinful. Waggoner described the case as \"the tip of the spear in the Western world,\" and said that, more and more, U.S. government officials were \"gaining power in order to create or impose a new orthodoxy in human sexuality and sexual ethics.\" With a smile, she added, \"I see a lot of darkness.\"\n\nWhat Waggoner calls a \"new orthodoxy,\" of course, is what liberals call freedom and equality: the right to choose a partner of any sex, to take pride in a nontraditional gender identity, to make decisions about your own body. But A.D.F. sees the story of the past sixty years as a historic aberration. For centuries, nearly every major civilization had held similar beliefs: sex was for married heterosexuals; making babies was the point. But, beginning in the nineteen-sixties, the Supreme Court began abetting a radical transformation in sexual ethics by citing a novel \"right to privacy,\" initially in a case about married couples purchasing condoms. By expanding that right to cover abortion, gay sex, and same-sex marriage, the Court had effectively redefined sex as a form of individual self-expression. The only meaning or purpose of sex was in the minds of the adults having it. (In Casey, the majority held that sex was part of \"the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\") In this new era of \"plastic sex\"-a phrase that a Blackstone lecturer borrowed from the British sociologist Anthony Giddens-children all but vanished from the picture.\n\nNext, the A.D.F. story goes, advocates of plastic sex began redescribing sexual urges as group identities. Same-sex attraction, once a kink, now defined a person. And sex without fear of pregnancy was no longer merely a desire; the Court found that it was a necessary component of a free, full life, which meant that the right to abortion was essential to women. And the traditional view of sexuality-common to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam-was recast as bigotry.\n\nWaggoner referred me repeatedly to a dissent by Justice Alito in Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. A.D.F. bulletins often quote Alito's words, which she deems prophetic. \"I assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes,\" Alito warned. \"But if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools.\"\n\nDepending on whom you ask, the Obergefell ruling either shaped or reflected a stunning transformation of American public opinion. Twice as many people now support same-sex marriage as oppose it-roughly the inverse of the ratio of only twenty years ago. Yet Waggoner contended to me that the agenda behind Obergefell was more sinister: \"The intent was to vilify those who believed in marriage between a man and a woman, and to use the law against them so that they would become enemies of the law. And that is exactly what we saw happen.\"\n\nWaggoner said that A.D.F. was \"not looking to polarize.\" She made a point of noting that members of her extended family are gay, and that she is friendly toward them. She even asserted that A.D.F. had represented openly gay clients-although, citing confidentiality, she wouldn't name any. \"Scripture says that homosexuality is wrong,\" she said. \"But it also says that lying is wrong. And Scripture teaches that you're entitled to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of what life-style choices you're making.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nYet: \"life-style choices.\" Would A.D.F. hire an L.G.B.T. person? Waggoner said, \"If someone were to say, 'I struggle with same-sex attraction,' that is different than saying, 'I am gay.' \" But \"we also believe that same-sex behavior is wrong, that it's a sin.\" Although people who identify as L.G.B.T. are entitled to respect, she noted, \"I should also be able to suggest that I think there's a different path that can be taken, and not be put in jail for that or censored by my government.\" (An A.D.F. spokesperson acknowledged that no American has ever been jailed or censored for homophobia. But he noted that anti-discrimination laws in New York and Minnesota allow jail time as a potential penalty.)\n\nTo L.G.B.T. people, \"life style\" and \"path\" are the code words of bigots. Still, Waggoner said that A.D.F. is consistent about its sexual ethics: divorce may lead to termination, depending on an assessment of the \"Biblical\" grounds for the breakup.\n\nLiberals, and some conservatives, say that A.D.F.'s fear of plastic-sex authoritarianism is wildly paranoid. Half the fifty states have not passed any law against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Supreme Court has never held that sexual orientation is a \"suspect class,\" like race, that warrants special scrutiny when it is used as a basis for laws, employment, housing, or other distinctions. Most important, the current Supreme Court appears to lean toward A.D.F.'s views. Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law and philosophy at Northwestern University who has studied A.D.F.'s cases, told me that ten years ago the group was considered so extreme that its claims \"bordered on the frivolous.\" Now \"A.D.F. needs to be taken seriously, because any claim they make has a shot at five votes on the Supreme Court.\" Even the majority opinion in Obergefell, by Justice Anthony Kennedy, included an unusual concession: \"Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.\"\n\nIndeed, secular-liberal tyranny has been a running theme of some Justices. In a 2018 case, A.D.F. successfully opposed California's requirement that \"pro-life\" pregnancy-counselling centers post notices about the availability of public funding for abortion; the majority opinion, by Justice Clarence Thomas, likened the state's measure to Stalinism, Nazism, the Cultural Revolution in China, and Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu. (\"As they should!\" Waggoner told me. \"It was shocking!\") The next year, in a majority opinion that supported keeping a giant cross on public property, Alito warned of \"militantly secular regimes,\" such as a government that \"roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine.\" In the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, the Court ruled for the baker on the ground that the Colorado civil-rights commission had displayed an impermissible animus against his faith. (At a hearing, a commissioner had said that \"freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust,\" calling it \"despicable\" when people \"use their religion to hurt others.\")\n\nIn oral arguments for 303 Creative, the case about the Web designer, Justice Barrett made A.D.F.'s case more effectively than Waggoner did. The crux of A.D.F.'s reasoning was that Lorie Smith, the designer, objected only to a message of support for same-sex marriage but had no bias against L.G.B.T. people. Barrett asked Waggoner if her client would create a Web site for people who were \"cisgender and heterosexual\" but wanted their \"wedding story\" to convey that their sexes were \"irrelevant to our relationship, which transcends such categories\"?\n\nWaggoner later described to me her befuddled reaction: \"I was, like, 'cisgender'?\" When she began to say that her client would design such a Web site, Barrett cut her off and unspooled a fresh hypothetical: What about adulterous co-workers who wanted a wedding site celebrating their divorces? Wouldn't those messages violate the designer's Biblical views, regardless of the newlyweds' sexual orientation? Waggoner-now getting it-hastened to agree.\n\nA former A.D.F. lawyer told me that it was \"destructive\" of the organization to keep warning Christians \"that the Church is facing mortal peril, that it is on the brink of real persecution and destruction.\" In fact, the lawyer said, Christian legal rights are \"more secure than they have ever been,\" and A.D.F. itself \"is incredibly successful.\" But Waggoner told me that the issues A.D.F. was contesting \"would have been unimaginable to most Americans just fifteen years ago\" and that \"the staggering number of people requesting our help tells you this moment is an assault on our freedom.\" She added, \"Just because we have prevailed in some cases, that doesn't mean that the threat in our generation is not more significant than ever before.\"\n\nThe next priority for A.D.F., Waggoner told me, is fighting \"the radical gender-identity ideology infiltrating the law\"-that is, transgender rights. Waggoner said that she doesn't believe in transgender identity, only in \"gender dysphoria,\" adding, \"I believe there are people who are uncomfortable in their bodies.\" She cited growing numbers-the 1.4 per cent of American teen-agers now identifying as trans may be roughly double the percentage in 2017, according to a U.C.L.A. study of government data-as evidence that forces in culture, education, and the law have fuelled a \"social contagion.\" Schools were pushing minors too young to give meaningful consent toward irreversible \"sterilization and chemical castration,\" all to treat adolescent feelings of awkwardness that could be addressed by psychological counselling. It was all \"absurd,\" she insisted.\n\nA.D.F. began a pushback against \"gender identity\" in 2014, shortly after Waggoner joined the organization, as the head of its allied-attorney program. Its first effort centered on public bathrooms and school locker rooms, implicitly portraying transgender girls as a menace to others. A.D.F. mailed out a draft policy to school districts recommending sex segregation for any spaces \"where persons may be in a state of undress\" and defining sex as \"either male or female, as objectively determined by anatomy and/or genetics at the time of birth.\" The next year, the organization sent lawmakers model legislation that effectively offered a bounty to any student who found \"a person of the opposite sex\" in a bathroom or locker room. A student could sue a school for a payment of twenty-five hundred dollars, in addition to psychological damages and legal fees. Republican lawmakers introduced similar bills in at least ten states, and in 2016 North Carolina passed a version that applied to all public agencies.\n\nThe outcry was earthshaking: why were North Carolina Republicans so obsessed with bathroom encounters? Trade associations pulled conventions; PayPal and other companies withdrew plans to expand in the state; the N.B.A. relocated events; Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert. The Republican governor who signed the legislation went down to defeat in the next election, and his Democratic successor signed a repeal. A.D.F. had inadvertently delivered a victory for L.G.B.T. rights.\n\nA.D.F. overshot in court, too. It was defending a Detroit funeral parlor against claims of discrimination from an employee fired for announcing a gender transition and requesting a woman's uniform. The proprietor was Christian, and A.D.F.'s lawyers initially argued that the state could not force him to violate his religious beliefs. But, when the case reached the Supreme Court, A.D.F. sought a broader ruling, asking the Court to find that any employer could fire someone solely for identifying as transgender, because federal laws against sex discrimination didn't protect people who identify as L.G.B.T. John J. Bursch, the A.D.F. lawyer arguing the case, told the Court, \"Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women.\" The Court disagreed. L.G.B.T.-rights groups hailed the ruling, issued in 2020 as Bostock v. Clayton County. But Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, practically invited Waggoner to return to the Court with A.D.F.'s original argument about religious freedom. The Court remained \"deeply concerned\" about such matters, Gorsuch wrote, emphasizing that these were \"questions for future cases.\" Waggoner, taking the hint, told me that she expected to bring cases \"at the edges\" of Bostock.\n\nIn internal lectures, A.D.F. lawyers describe a change in strategy when Waggoner took over, six years ago: a drive to pick smarter battles, including in the court of public opinion. A Connecticut case against transgender rights exemplified the shift. In 2017, Andraya Yearwood and Terry Miller, transgender girls at a Connecticut high school, began setting sprinting records at statewide track meets. At the time, the National Collegiate Athletic Association required a year of hormone therapy before a transgender woman could compete in a female event, but Connecticut qualified girls on the basis of identity alone. Neither student had yet undergone any medical treatment, and in finish-line photographs they looked conspicuously bigger than other racers. Hulu later made a documentary hailing Yearwood as a pathbreaker. She told the filmmakers, \"On the girls' team, I just feel amazing, just knowing that I get to be who I am.\"\n\nWaggoner, who played basketball and volleyball in high school, told me, \"I felt like you knew, as a woman, that this is wrong.\" Seemingly aligning herself with nineteen-seventies feminism, she added, \"Underlying all of this is whether women have any rights at all, and it's shocking to me that we're even debating this, especially after fifty years of trying to advance those rights.\"\n\nBianca Stanescu, whose daughter Selina Soule lost medals to the trans girls, had started a petition opposing the state's rules. A.D.F. lawyers sought out the family and persuaded the Soules to file a lawsuit claiming that Connecticut's policy violated the Title IX guarantee of an equal chance for female athletes to compete and win. Selina was a far more sympathetic protagonist than a hypothetical student confronting someone in a bathroom. Tucker Carlson, then at Fox News, interviewed her, and she said, \"We missed out on winning the State Open Championship because of the team that the transgender athlete was on.\"\n\nWaggoner told me that conservative organizations and Republican politicians across the country have followed A.D.F.'s lead. \"We were the first,\" she said proudly. \"And, because we were willing to file suit, state legislators were coming to us and saying, 'What can we do in our state?' Now twenty-three states have passed laws to protect women's sports.\" The appeals court in New York is expected to issue a ruling in the Soule case soon; among many other transgender cases, A.D.F. has filed a suit in Alaska to protect the right of a shelter for battered women to turn away transgender clients.\n\nA.D.F. has now taken on suits across the country opposing liberal policies concerning children and adolescents who identify as transgender-relatively favorable terrain for its side of the fight. Waggoner told me that an A.D.F. goal is to persuade the Supreme Court to establish \"parental rights\" as a constitutional principle: \"It's not that the Court is going to say, 'Gender ideology is bad.' But I do think the Court could say, 'Parental rights are fundamental rights.' \"\n\nPrecedents from the nineteen-twenties protect the rights of parents to teach their children a foreign language or send them to Catholic schools, but the Court has said little else on the subject. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of conservative jurisprudence, declared in a 2015 speech that the Constitution guaranteed parents no such rights: \"My right to raise my children the way I want, to teach them what I want them taught, not what Big Brother says-that is not there.\" Following Scalia's logic, a Justice who finds a constitutional guarantee of parental rights would be as fanciful as the liberals who once detected a right to privacy in \"penumbras\" around the Bill of Rights. (Waggoner told me that Scalia was \"not perfect.\")\n\nA.D.F. staff in Washington are pushing for legislation that would make it easier to sue school districts for alleged violations of parental rights. Its lawyers have brought \"parental-rights\" cases both in appellate circuits that lean left and in others that lean right, increasing the chance that a split will compel the Supreme Court to take up the issue. In Waukesha, Wisconsin, part of the conservative circuit based in Chicago, A.D.F. is representing parents suing their school district for ignoring their request to treat their twelve-year-old as a girl (the child, for a time, had requested to be treated as a boy). And in Loudoun County, Virginia, part of the liberal circuit based in Richmond, A.D.F. is representing Christian teachers who oppose the district's policy of letting students choose their pronouns without telling their parents. (In 2021, A.D.F. won an appeals-court decision that a public college couldn't make a professor use a student's preferred pronouns.)\n\nA.D.F.'s campaign against L.G.B.T. rights can have an intimidating effect. Last November, in Asheville, North Carolina, the Reverend Ronald Gates, who volunteers as an A.D.F. community \"ambassador,\" appeared before the city's school board and repeatedly addressed a transgender woman on the board as \"Mr.\" When the board member, Peyton O'Connor, asked the pastor to \"refrain from bigotry and hate speech,\" Gates shouted, \"I will say 'Mr.'-if the blood was drawn, it would be XY, which is a male! \" (Gates didn't return my phone calls.)\n\nO'Connor subsequently resigned. She told me she'd been afraid that A.D.F. would turn the incident into yet another culture-war flash point. \"A.D.F. is really good at drawing people into these fights that are really of little consequence,\" she told me. \"It becomes a way to mobilize their base, and to draw more attention to these right-wing causes. If you look at their Web site, they use these things for the fund-raising drumbeat-like, 'We have got queers in the public-school systems! Everybody, give us money so we can fight this evil!' That is their business model.\" (An A.D.F. spokesperson said that, as a matter of policy, it doesn't confront individuals or elected officials, and that its ambassadors aren't authorized to speak for the organization.)\n\nPitting conservative Christian parents, employers, and creative professionals against L.G.B.T. rights reminded me of the incremental approach that A.D.F. and its allies had adopted during the long struggle to overturn Roe: undermining the precedent bit by bit, by defending parental-notification laws, waiting periods, and so on. With Roe gone, the surviving precedent most objectionable to conservative Christians is undoubtedly Obergefell-the same-sex marriage decision. In some ways, Obergefell is also fragile. Two of the five Justices in its majority, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy, have been replaced by conservatives, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. And some lawyers argue that the Obergefell majority fatally contradicted itself by calling the opposition to same-sex marriage \"decent and honorable.\" (Robert George, a Princeton legal scholar and another occasional lecturer at A.D.F.'s Blackstone program, told me, \"If that line is right, then the outcome is wrong.\") The majority concluded that the right to same-sex marriage was embedded in the Constitution's guarantees of due process, but in a vigorous dissent Alito quoted a precedent that \"due process\" includes only rights \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" He argued that \"it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights.\" Alito's argument about \"deeply rooted\" rights is the exact argument that six Justices endorsed in overturning Roe.\n\nBy reinforcing Kennedy's \"decent and honorable\" caveat, A.D.F.'s victories have also undermined the idea that a right to same-sex marriage was ever \"deeply rooted.\" Shortly after the 303 Creative decision, a Christian justice of the peace in Waco, Texas, filed a lawsuit claiming that her religious conviction exempted her from performing same-sex marriages. She argued that the 303 Creative precedent \"rejects the idea of a 'compelling interest' \" in the equal treatment of same-sex couples.\n\nWaggoner did not want to discuss Obergefell. \"I'm worried you're gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I'm abandoning Obergefell, and I am not,\" she said. \"I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don't wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nChanging the subject, she mentioned the recent Grammy Awards broadcast. Sam Smith, who identifies as nonbinary, had dressed as Satan for a raunchy S & M stage show with the trans singer Kim Petras. Waggoner said, \"What I wake up thinking about is what Obergefell has caused the current cultural moment.\"\n\nRecently, A.D.F. opened a new front in its \"parental-rights\" fight: a lawsuit over teaching about racism. The school district that includes Charlottesville, Virginia, began devising an anti-racist curriculum after white supremacists gathered there in 2017 for the Unite the Right rally. Two years ago, a middle-school pilot program was launched with a slide presentation that quoted the author and activist Ibram X. Kendi : \"Children are either going to learn racist or antiracist ideas. In other words, if we don't actively protect them from this dangerous racist society, what do you think they will be taught?\"\n\nAt school-board meetings, some parents objected that the curriculum's discussions of \"white privilege\" and a \"dominant culture\" taught racial stereotypes or stigmatized white people. One such parent, Carlos Ibañez, an oral surgeon who'd emigrated from Panama, alerted A.D.F., and became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit charging that the district had violated civil-rights laws by treating students differently on the basis of race.\n\nWaggoner told me that the case extended A.D.F.'s defense of parental rights; schools were treating children as \"the property of the state.\" She argued that the content of Charlottesville's curriculum was \"way outside the bounds\" of the Constitution's limits.\n\nI was surprised she'd plunged A.D.F. into debates about race. The suit does little \"to keep the door open for the Gospel.\" Instead of arguing for freedom of religion or expression, A.D.F. appeared to be policing the speech of Charlottesville teachers, seeking a ruling that certain lessons were off limits. What's more, A.D.F.'s arguments against anti-discrimination protections for L.G.B.T. people had already raised awkward questions about its stance toward other forms of bigotry.\n\nIn 2021, A.D.F. sued the Biden Administration for requiring that federally funded adoption agencies work with same-sex couples. A.D.F. argued that the policy violated the religious freedom of its client, Holston United Methodist Home for Children, in Tennessee. The Administration quickly folded; the Supreme Court had tipped the scales for Holston by ruling that a similar policy in the city of Philadelphia had violated the religious freedom of Catholic Social Services. But the next year Holston leveraged the same religious-freedom argument to reject a couple because they were Jewish. Gabriel Rutan-Ram, the would-be father, told me that Holston's decision was \"blatant antisemitism.\" With help from the liberal group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, he and his wife are now suing the Tennessee agency that partially funds Holston. (Waggoner told me that excluding Jews is \"not something we would advocate for,\" but argued that, under certain circumstances, a religious agency could have that right.)\n\nDuring oral arguments in 303 Creative, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused Waggoner of justifying all kinds of bigotry. If a designer could turn away a wedding commission because the partners were gay, what other couples could be rebuffed? Sotomayor asked, \"How about people who don't believe in interracial marriage, or about people who don't believe that disabled people should get married?\" Where would Waggoner draw \"a limiting line\"?\n\nWaggoner, struggling to deflect, first proposed that a true bigot would refuse to serve a whole category of people-Blacks, the disabled, people who identify as L.G.B.T. But 303 Creative welcomed gay clients and objected only to gay weddings.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked a hypothetical photographer selling pictures of children with Santa. Although he takes portraits of Black children in other contexts, he wants these shots to evoke a nostalgic, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" feeling. Can he turn away Black children in the name of his art? Waggoner was forced to concede that her free-speech argument might indeed protect racists. The Court, she noted, had \"protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past.\"\n\nWhen I asked Waggoner about the exchange, she grew almost heated. She said that I'd \"pushed a button,\" and complained that invoking the spectre of racism was a tactic \"designed to malign, shame, and bully people.\"\n\nLike the Charlottesville race case, many of A.D.F.'s recent battles turn on a similar question: Who's bullying whom? Have conservative Christians, as Alito claims, become an imperilled minority, whispering in the recesses of their homes that marriage is between a man and a woman?\n\nWaggoner's critics say that she ignores history. Conservative Christians may be a minority now, but civil-rights laws don't protect Black or L.G.B.T. people simply because they're outnumbered. Sarah Warbelow, of the Human Rights Campaign, told me, \" 'Minorities' is the wrong word. The argument is for protections for vulnerable people-individuals and classes of people who have historically, and ongoingly, experienced discrimination in the public sphere, in public accommodation, housing, employment, credit, and education. The vast majority of Christians are not being discriminated against in these areas of life. A baker is not refusing to make a baptismal or First Communion cake for their child.\"\n\nIn Waggoner's conversations with me, she made an argument that she got cut off trying to make during the 303 Creative case. The difference between turning down a same-sex couple and turning down an interracial couple, she told me, was in the historic roots of the motivation. In Loving v. Virginia, the Court had concluded that banning interracial marriage was \"part of a whole system of laws that were designed to subjugate a whole class of people, out of group bigotry.\" But the belief that marriage was between a man and a woman had a more dignified pedigree: \"the teachings of all the Abrahamic faiths.\" She said, \"So to suggest that those two things are in any way similar is either misinformed or it is designed to shut down the conversation.\"\n\nSlavery, of course, was also a centuries-old tradition whose defenders cited deep roots in the Abrahamic faiths. And Abraham himself was polygamous. But, for now, most of the Justices appear to share Waggoner's perspective. In 303 Creative, as the liberal Justices kept hammering her, Alito threw her a lifeline. In Obergefell, he prodded, \"did the Court say religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same thing as religious or other objections to people of color?\"\n\nNo, Waggoner answered, back on firm footing and playing along. With a smile, she repeated the words the Supreme Court had used to describe opposition to gay marriage: people like her were \"decent and honorable.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled Ruth Bader Ginsburg's name.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What the End of Roe v. Wade Will Mean for the Next Generation of Obstetricians\n\nFor a long time, Cara Buskmiller has known two things about herself: she wants to deliver babies, and she is called by her faith to a lifetime of virginity. Growing up in nineteen-nineties Dallas with six younger siblings, Buskmiller knew a little about pregnancy and birth, and was interested in medicine. But she truly decided on obstetrics in the seventh grade, after touring an ob-gyn's office with her Girl Scout troop. She saw posters promoting contraception on every wall-something her parents, devout Catholics, had taught her was wrong-and she thought, Oh, my gosh, I have to become an OB to combat this!\n\nHer second vocation took longer to discern. She tried dating in college, carefully considering all the eligible Catholic men she knew, but no one felt like an obvious match. She flirted with the Catholic Church's version of a sorority rush for nuns, visiting convents and chatting with sisters to see whether that should be her path. But it turned out that the answer was in her own family: her great aunt Marjorie, a former teacher, was a consecrated virgin, dedicated to chastity and obedience while also able to pursue an independent professional life. Today, Buskmiller is unfazed by questions about why a professed virgin would specialize in a field of medicine that's all about sex. \"Doesn't God have a sense of humor?\" she asked, chuckling.\n\nBut in 2010, as Buskmiller prepared to apply to medical school, she worried that admissions committees would be skeptical of her beliefs, and how her personal objections to abortion and birth control would affect her practice as an ob-gyn. What would program directors think of the volunteer stints she'd done at a crisis pregnancy center? And, when it came time for residency, would she be able to duck out of certain clinical rotations to avoid assisting with abortions?\n\nBuskmiller got into medical school at Texas A. & M., and she went on to do her residency at St. Louis University, a Catholic school. But she felt that students like her needed more backup. So, during her second year as a resident, she launched a Web site called Conscience in Residency, a support network for doctors-in-training who have moral objections to abortion. The site's tagline is \"You're not crazy, and you're not alone.\" Buskmiller maintains a crowdsourced spreadsheet where residency candidates note which institutions made them feel welcome-and which ones didn't. An \"abortion 'mecca,' \" someone commented about Oregon Health & Science University, in Portland: \"Two faculty members stated directly in medical student lectures that they think anyone holding a conscientious objection to abortion should reconsider if it's ethical to be an ob-gyn.\" Another commenter wrote, of Southern Illinois University, in Springfield, that the program director \"seemed very shocked when I asked about opting out of sterilizations.\" Most of the residents, the commenter added, \"are very involved in 'abortion advocacy.' \"\n\nEven in an era when Roe v. Wade looks likely to be overturned , residents who describe themselves as pro-life are countercultural within their field. They believe that fetuses are human persons with moral status; when Buskmiller encounters a woman in even the earliest stages of pregnancy, she sees two patients, not one. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG , on the other hand, firmly maintains that abortion is a form of health care and supports the right of a patient to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability. Progressive physicians and students argue that abortion access is not just crucial for their patients' health but for a more economically and racially just society. They believe that abortion can help keep families out of poverty and that it protects the lives of Black women, who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are three times as likely as white women to die from pregnancy-related causes. Meanwhile, residency-program directors may hesitate when they encounter students who decline to participate in abortion training, which involves learning how to care for patients in emergencies as well as before and after the procedure. Even doctors who don't perform abortions are likely to encounter patients who have had them. Knowing more about that experience makes them better practitioners, Jody Steinauer, an ob-gyn professor at the University of California, San Francisco (U.C.S.F.), said.\n\nStill, there's a surprising amount of subtle variation among how people in the medical community think about this issue. All students and young doctors have to sort out questions of how they want to practice medicine; aspiring ob-gyns' views on abortion might determine what training they seek out, which specialities they pursue, and where they choose to live. In a post-Roe world , that self-sorting process would grow even more intense: in roughly half the country, abortion would be all but illegal, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive-rights think tank. Medical residents in those states would likely have to go elsewhere to learn about abortions, just as patients would have to travel to get the procedure. In the other half of the country, demand for abortions would almost certainly shoot up, putting pressure on physicians, hospitals, and clinics to serve patients from out of state. For all doctors and trainees, no matter their views, this geographic divide could pose dilemmas-even for anti-abortion students who would presumably welcome the reversal of Roe. Simple slogans and tidy categories are useful for politics but not for medicine. \"Pro-life people do not understand why gynecologists talk about the need for abortion until they see a woman dying in front of their eyes because they're pregnant,\" Buskmiller said. \"I think it's possible to be pro-life, in spite of those situations. But we can't have rose-colored glasses and think the situation is easy. It is not.\"\n\nDoctors haven't always seen abortion as a form of health care. The text of Roe v. Wade hints at the differences among physicians in the early seventies; the Supreme Court took it for granted that some doctors would object to abortion for either moral or religious reasons. Feminist scholars have noted that the Justices seemed just as preoccupied with physicians' rights as they were with women's rights. \"The abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician,\" Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in the opinion of the Court.\n\nAround the time that the Court was assessing the case, however, a hundred doctors signed a letter advocating a new, patient-centered approach to health care. \"It will be necessary for physicians to realize that abortion has become a predominantly social as well as medical responsibility,\" they wrote. \"For the first time . . . doctors will be expected to do an operation simply because the patient asks that it be done.\" They were arguing for a new way of thinking about medicine: at least when it comes to pregnancy, doctors shouldn't be the deciders. Patients should.\n\nIt took many years for medical schools and health institutions to adopt this attitude. In the decades after Roe, \"contraception was not considered to be a training topic worthy of an ob-gyn,\" Eve Espey, the chair of the ob-gyn department at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, told me. \"Abortion was just taboo. It was felt to be an activity that was dominated by older men for a profit motive.\" Even by 1992, just twelve per cent of ob-gyn residency programs included training on abortion procedures.\n\nIn the early nineties, however, a major shift began-one led, in part, by students. In 1993, when Steinauer was a medical student at U.C.S.F., she founded an organization called Medical Students for Choice, with the goal of expanding abortion access. Many doctors who had started practicing before Roe, Steinauer told me, provided abortions out of necessity: they had seen women die and were committed to preventing that from happening again. \"I would say my generation started thinking about it a little differently,\" she said. \"It was a little more activist- and advocacy-oriented.\" They didn't want a woman's right to an abortion to be merely theoretical.\n\nThe best way to expand access to abortions, Steinauer believed, was to train more doctors to perform them. She and her fellow-students began lobbying the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to make training on elective abortions mandatory for ob-gyn residency programs, and in 1995 this became the standard-all residents had to learn about abortion. But the next year, after pushback from Catholic hospitals and other groups, Congress passed an amendment to a public-health law, prohibiting discrimination against medical-training programs that refused to teach abortion procedures. The amendment underlined a growing tension in the field: legally, no one could be forced to perform abortions. But, culturally, pro-choice voices were growing louder within the world of obstetrics, arguing that abortion is a necessary part of reproductive health care.\n\nIn 1999, Susan Thompson Buffett, the wife of the multibillionaire Warren Buffett, bankrolled a new initiative called the Ryan Residency Training Program, which provided funding, curriculum help, and other resources to residency programs that teach abortion procedures. When I spoke with Steinauer, the director, she said that, as the program became more widely known, students who were serious about family planning began asking about Ryan rotations in their residency interviews: \"They saw it as a core part of their identity as ob-gyn physicians.\" (A sister program, RHEDI , also provides family-medicine programs with resources to train residents about abortion.) Now, if a medical student wants to focus on providing abortions, she can choose from more than a hundred programs that follow the Ryan model, which has been adopted by roughly a third of ob-gyn residency programs. She'll learn how to counsel patients on birth control and medication that can induce abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy, and, at some point in her training, she'll likely perform dilation and evacuation on patients in their second trimester of pregnancy, a process that involves opening a woman's cervix and removing the fetus. If the student wants to learn how to perform abortions on patients in complex medical situations, including those who are far along in their pregnancies, she can pursue a fellowship in complex family planning-a specialty that became fully accredited only two years ago.\n\nAnd yet, even now, with the Ryan program in full force and Roe still in place, a remarkably small portion of doctors perform abortions. In a 2019 survey, published by the ACOG 's journal, just twenty-four per cent of ob-gyns reported performing the procedure. (In some states, nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, and physician assistants can also provide abortions, most commonly by medication.) Another ten to twenty per cent of doctors reported that they would be willing to provide abortions and have the training to do so-but cannot, owing to hospital policies or regulations on abortion medication. Others simply don't want abortion to be part of their medical life.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how many medical students and residents would describe themselves as pro-life. Surveys of Ryan residents indicate that nineteen per cent opt out of certain aspects of their family-planning training, but this doesn't account for residents at other schools, some of whom have deliberately self-selected away from programs that follow the Ryan model. (On Buskmiller's spreadsheet, these programs are carefully flagged.)\n\nAshley Womack-a friend of Buskmiller's from high school-knew that she wanted to opt out of abortion training when she was applying for residency programs, in 2014. She purposely avoided programs in liberal states; she ended up accepting an offer from the medical center at the University of Texas, Austin, where program leaders assured her that they wouldn't make her do anything she didn't want to do. Womack, who is Catholic and now works in private practice in Dallas, won't perform abortions or sterilizations. (Her personal Web site indicates that her practice follows the Catholic Church's directives on health care.) Although she'll counsel patients on their birth-control options, she won't prescribe the pill or place intrauterine devices for contraceptive purposes. She told me that, when she was considering which field of medicine to pursue, she felt called to \"be a pro-life voice\" in obstetrics. Surveys show that roughly half of Americans consider themselves pro-life, she reasoned: \"Why would it not make sense to have ob-gyns who are reflective of the population?\" But, entering the field, she quickly discovered that this was not a popular view. \"You need to work extra hard to be an excellent resident,\" she told me. \"That's how I felt the entire time-I need to be perfect so the only thing they can complain about is that I don't do these things.\"\n\nSoon after Womack started her residency, the program requirements changed: family-planning rotations at Planned Parenthood became mandatory. Womack knew a couple of residents whose requests not to go had been declined. So, uneasy, she showed up for her first day. The experience was upsetting: in her view, the medical staff didn't fully counsel patients on options other than abortion. When Womack made it clear that she wasn't going to assist with performing abortions, she was sent to the recovery room to clean chairs and hand out crackers.\n\nDuring my reporting, several sources suggested that aspiring obstetricians who object to abortion should find another line of work. Meg Autry, who until recently directed the residency program at U.C.S.F., told me that many physicians who support abortion rights, particularly those who are active in family planning, feel this way. Buskmiller, who is now a maternal-fetal-medicine fellow at the U.T. Health Science Center at Houston and wants to specialize in fetal surgery, has taken a professional interest in the antagonism she perceives toward students and residents in obstetrics who don't want to perform abortions. In 2021, she co-authored a paper published in The Linacre Quarterly, a Catholic medical journal, finding that roughly a quarter of residency-program directors expressed strong negative reactions to residency candidates who say that they won't perform abortions. (They had much stronger reactions to other kinds of refusals, such as counselling or prescribing birth control.) \"If an applicant can't fulfill the basic duties of our program . . . it doesn't matter how excellent they are otherwise,\" one director wrote. \"No one can reasonably hire a quadrapelgic police officer, even if they passed the written test with a perfect score.\" It seems like this mentality will become more widespread if Roe is overturned and access to abortion training is even more limited than it is now. \"When everyone has to be trained, then you have the luxury of saying, 'Oh, let's make sure we have a diversity of opinion so we can make the conversation broader and more robust,' \" Autry said.\n\nIn the absolutist world of social media, the end of Roe may intensify existing conflicts between medical students who are for and against abortion. After we spoke, Buskmiller passed along screenshots of a Twitter dustup from a couple of years ago, in which a medical student got more than seven hundred likes for expressing outrage at a first-year man at her school who wanted to start a pro-life student organization: \"Pro-life anything has NO PLACE in a medical school.\" These are the little signals that make young doctors like Buskmiller unsure of their place in the field. \"You can skate through pretty easily if you remain quiet, and if your choices . . . don't end up on Twitter,\" she said.\n\nAnd yet, throughout much of the U.S., students, residents, and doctors have already been living and working alongside people whose views differ from their own. For these physicians, division over abortion is just a part of life. When Mallory Vial, a medical student who grew up in a small, conservative city in Mississippi, arrived at the U.T. Health Science Center at Houston, she expected the other students and aspiring OBs to be interested in learning about pregnancy termination-or at least engaged on the abortion issue. But \"it's been such a mixed bag,\" she told me. During the spring of her first year, she became the president of the campus chapter of Medical Students for Choice. The biggest challenge she faced was apathy. \"Most people in our class and at our school are more in the middle and kind of staying out of the debate,\" she told me. \"When there's confrontation, they don't really think it applies to them.\"\n\nTo her surprise, Vial often found more in common with members of Physicians for Life, the anti-abortion student group, than with her other classmates. At least they cared. \"When we're having these conversations, we disagree, so there is conflict, quote-unquote,\" she said. \"But it's also productive-and I think good-to see that there is diversity of opinion. . . . There's no reason for medicine to be a monolith on this issue.\" She'd attend Physicians for Life lectures and collaborate with the group on events.\n\nAs Vial was deciding where to apply for residency last fall, she debated whether to stay in Texas or pursue her education in another state. She knows that she eventually wants to practice medicine in the South-it's where she feels most connected to patients, she said-but getting comprehensive abortion training in the region won't be possible if the Court overturns Roe, since most Southern states will likely ban the procedure at six weeks into a pregnancy or even earlier. Despite applying to programs in various states, Vial ended up matching at the same center in Houston where she went to medical school. (Vial, along with Buskmiller and other doctors I spoke with, emphasized that her views are her own, not a reflection of her medical school or residency program.)\n\nIn some ways, Vial is typical of her generation's progressive, abortion-supporting ob-gyn medical students. She firmly believes that the procedure should be legal and accessible, and is determined to get family-planning training in residency. She sees political advocacy as an integral part of what it means to be a doctor; she feels obligated to improve not just patients' health but the systems in which they live. In other ways, she's had to grapple with the future of her field before the rest of her cohort. If Roe falls, abortion will no longer be a question that ob-gyn students and residents can ignore. It won't be a question that any doctor can ignore.\n\nHow will medical students and residents figure out their approach to abortion in a world without Roe? Depending on where in the country they live, maybe they'll perform first-trimester abortions but nothing later in pregnancy. Maybe they'll pick a speciality in which abortion doesn't come up. Or maybe they'll pursue advanced training to perform abortions at twenty weeks or later in a pregnancy. Research suggests that obstetricians already set personal limits based on the circumstances of the abortion: in one study, about a third of ob-gyns said that they wouldn't help a woman with five daughters terminate after she found out she was pregnant with another healthy girl, for example, whereas nearly all the respondents said that they'd aid a woman with cardiopulmonary disease who might die during pregnancy.\n\nBut, if Roe is overturned, it will become that much harder for new doctors to navigate these messy boundaries-to learn how to treat real human beings with complicated stories and difficult situations. Lisa Harris, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan, wrote a paper in 2008 describing the experience of performing an abortion while she was about eighteen weeks pregnant on a patient who was roughly as far along. \"With my first pass of the forceps, I grasped an extremity and began to pull it down. I could see a small foot hanging from the teeth of my forceps. With a quick tug, I separated the leg. Precisely at that moment, I felt a kick-a fluttery 'thump, thump' in my own uterus,\" she wrote. She began crying, as though a message had been sent from \"my hand and my uterus to my tear ducts,\" a response \"unmediated by my training or my feminist pro-choice politics.\" It's unusual to hear this kind of story about abortion; \"frank talk like this is threatening to abortion rights,\" she wrote. But doctors like Harris have learned to reconcile multiple conflicting truths: \"I respect a woman's request to end a pregnancy, which I understand as a request to help shape the course of her life. And I understand that a person won't be born because of that,\" she wrote in a 2019 op-ed .\n\nWitnessing abortion up close can change the minds of those who are uncomfortable with the procedure, too. One female Ryan program participant in the Northeast wrote on a follow-up survey that seeing the circumstances of an elective abortion late in pregnancy helped her empathize with that choice a little more. Another woman, in the South, noted that she developed close friendships with fellow-residents who performed abortions-which changed how she saw abortion providers.\n\nVial and Buskmiller have never met, despite their shared affiliation with the University of Texas. Vial is about as far politically from Buskmiller as someone can be. As an undergrad, Vial was the president of her school's Secular Student Alliance, and she wants to pursue a fellowship in complex family planning, where she'd learn how to perform abortions on women well into their pregnancies. But Vial says that she's benefitted from knowing people like Buskmiller-the experience will help her be a better doctor to conservative patients in the South.\n\nAnd even Buskmiller says that she has benefitted from having colleagues with views like Vial's. Despite the years she has spent refining her theological and philosophical position on why abortion is wrong, she has found that theories don't always stand up to the test of experience. She told me the story of a pregnant patient she met while she was working night shifts as a first-year resident. The woman came into OB triage several times, and her situation always seemed precarious. She appeared to be homeless and was suffering from severe mental-health problems; it became clear that the woman didn't have a partner, and Buskmiller noticed signs that she did sex work to support herself. When Buskmiller thought about what this woman's plan should be-for taking care of this baby, for keeping herself healthy, for not getting pregnant again before she was ready-she realized that natural family planning, a Catholic alternative to birth control that typically involves tracking the menstrual cycle, was \"a woefully incomplete answer.\" She was forced to ask herself, Is my world view one that really works for the world that we live in?\n\n\"The conclusion I came to is: Something can be objectively best but totally unworkable in a given society,\" she said. Sometimes, she added, that means \"we have to find difficult solutions and be willing to cut to the quick in our own souls.\"\n\nIn the post-Roe era, letting pregnant patients get sicker- by design .\n\nThe study that debunks most anti-abortion arguments .\n\nOf course the Constitution has nothing to say about abortion .\n\nHow the real Jane Roe shaped the abortion wars.\n\nBlack feminists defined abortion rights as a matter of equality, not just \"choice.\"\n\nRecent data suggest that taking abortion pills at home is as safe as going to a clinic.\n\nWhen abortion is criminalized, women make desperate choices .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How the Real Jane Roe Shaped the Abortion Wars\n\nRoe v. Wade may be the rare Supreme Court decision that most Americans can name, but it's also one of the few that many volubly disparage-and not just anti-abortion activists who want to get rid of it altogether. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a staunch advocate of access to abortion but an open critic of the reasoning behind Roe. She thought the rationale should have centered on preventing sex discrimination rather than on preserving a right to privacy. \"The image you get from reading the Roe v. Wade opinion is it's mostly a doctor's-rights case-a doctor's right to prescribe what he thinks his patient needs,\" Ginsburg told the legal writer and scholar Jeffrey Rosen, in 2019. \"My idea of how choice should have developed was not a privacy notion, not a doctor's-right notion, but a woman's right to control her own destiny, to be able to make choices without a Big Brother state telling her what she can and cannot do.\"\n\nGinsburg also declared herself on board with another critique of the decision: namely, that when Roe was handed down, in 1973, it short-circuited a political process whereby states had been gradually legalizing abortion on their own, and thus created the conditions for a polarizing backlash that we are still living through. Although this interpretation is not entirely borne out by the facts-more on that later-it has congealed into conventional wisdom. \"Justice Harry Blackmun did more inadvertent damage to our democracy than any other 20th-century American,\" the columnist David Brooks wrote, in 2005, of the opinion's author. Roe v. Wade, Brooks argued, \"set off a cycle of political viciousness and counter-viciousness that has poisoned public life ever since.\" Unlike other rulings that recognized new social norms and established new constitutional rights-to interracial marriage and same-sex marriage, for instance-Roe v. Wade remains vulnerable even now, nearly half a century later, to a precedent-flipping, stare-decisis-flouting new ruling. It has never been more so, in fact, than it is now. In the coming term, the conservative-majority Court has agreed to hear a case in which the state of Mississippi is essentially seeking to overturn Roe, along with Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed the right to abortion before the stage of fetal viability. Earlier this month, the Court offered a preview of its orientation when it declined to halt enforcement of an even more draconian Texas law, which bans all abortions after about six weeks, a point at which many women do not even know that they are pregnant.\n\nRoe is unusual in another respect. In most landmark cases, the plaintiff doesn't stick around like an ornery barfly at closing time, making trouble for all sides. When Jane Roe, whose real name was Norma McCorvey, became a plaintiff in one of the highest-profile cases ever to go before the Supreme Court, she was a broke, divorced, twenty-two-year-old Texan with a ninth-grade education-\"a street person, drug addict, drunk,\" as she described herself, decades later. Most of her lovers were women, but, in 1970, she was unintentionally pregnant for the third time, by a flaky married guy who was already out of the picture. She wasn't looking for a crusade when she met with the feminist lawyers Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee at a pizza parlor in Dallas; she was looking for a way to end her pregnancy. Abortion was illegal in Texas, and McCorvey was most likely too far along in her pregnancy to make it to one of the few states where it wasn't; also, she'd been scared off by a reconnaissance visit to an illegal practitioner closer to home.\n\nBy the time the Court handed down its decision in the case, McCorvey had given birth to a baby girl and relinquished her for adoption. She had also met Connie Gonzalez, her devoted partner for many years (although McCorvey cheated on her with gusto), and the two were eking out a living as housecleaners. When McCorvey got the call from Weddington and learned that she'd prevailed in the highest court, the victory didn't mean much to her. As the journalist Joshua Prager writes in \"The Family Roe: An American Story\" (Norton), his prodigiously researched, richly detailed, sensitively told account of McCorvey's strange, and very American, odyssey, \"Her own lawyers had not much cared to know her. She, in turn, had not much cared to know about their case; when, months later, Norma listed in her red plastic datebook the important events of 1973, she included the Yom Kippur War, the Texas State Fair, and the closing of a local theater, but not the lawsuit that bore her assumed name.\"\n\nMcCorvey eventually acknowledged that she was Jane Roe and, in the late nineteen-eighties and early nineties, began making appearances in the national media. She served as an ambivalent asset to the pro-choice movement, attending rallies, and telling her story-not especially truthfully, according to Prager-in a best-selling 1994 memoir, \"I Am Roe.\" The ambivalence ran both ways, and was awkwardly riven by class. McCorvey thought the pro-choice leaders were hoity-toity. They left her out of events commemorating Roe where she figured she should have been a featured speaker. She thought they wanted her to be something she wasn't-\"a demure . . . white glove lady.\" (She felt differently about the celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, who did the talk-show circuit with her for a while and brought out McCorvey's salty, extemporaneous charm.)\n\nPro-choice activists didn't really want McCorvey donning white gloves, of all things, but they did tend to see her as a loose cannon and an unreliable narrator of her own life. For years, McCorvey had told reporters that the pregnancy she'd gone to court over had been the result of a rape. When she explained, in a 1987 interview, that it was actually a consensual encounter, the revelation came as an embarrassment to the pro-choice movement. Anti-abortion activists seized on the admission, arguing that it essentially invalidated the Court's ruling. Prager quotes a letter to a Virginia newspaper from a preacher: \"As a result of McCorvey's lie, more than twenty million babies have been aborted.\" In fact, neither McCorvey's affidavit nor Blackmun's opinion mentioned anything about how she got pregnant.\n\nThen, in the mid-nineties, while McCorvey was answering phones at an abortion clinic, she met Flip Benham, a former saloonkeeper turned anti-abortion militant. Benham was a born-again-Christian lay minister who preached not only against abortion but also against homosexuality. He kind of liked Norma, though, and, more to the point, he saw in her a prize convert for his movement. Soon he was pressing a Bible into her hands, making her a business card that read \"Miss Norma, Slave for Christ,\" and baptizing her in a back-yard pool in suburban Dallas. So began McCorvey's turn as an asset to the other side in the abortion wars. The head of Texans United for Life crowed, \"The poster child has jumped off the poster.\" In time, McCorvey rebelled against Benham's insistence that she renounce her lesbianism, but she continued to cast her lot with the anti-abortion side, eventually converting to Catholicism.\n\nPrager is not unsympathetic to McCorvey, but he sees her clearly. He notes that, unlike some of her feminist allies, pro-life leaders, even though they rejected her homosexuality, \"made a public point of embracing Norma as she was-blunt and blue-collar.\" He paints a believable portrait of a woman who cared about flirting and fun, seduction and sex, attention and affirmation-\"watching out for Norma's salvation and Norma's ass,\" as she once put it-but not about ideology, or politics, or anybody else's rights, really, let alone their souls. McCorvey confided to Prager, who spent time with her at the end of her life, \"It's really a lot harder on this side because you gotta act like you care. But I don't really give a shit.\"\n\nMcCorvey died in 2017, and three years later a documentary about her, \"AKA Jane Roe,\" portrayed her as having never truly changed her mind about abortion but having been paid off to say she had. Yet, in Prager's persuasive telling, it was not so much a secret deal as a product of McCorvey's personality. It's true that in the documentary McCorvey, interviewed in a nursing home, tells the filmmaker, Nick Sweeney, \"If a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine, it's no skin off my ass.\" And when Sweeney asks if her advocacy for the pro-life side \"was all an act,\" she replies, \"Yeah. I did it well, too.\" Though the film suggests that anti-abortion activists had paid McCorvey handsomely, Prager says she made something like eight hundred dollars on average for a talk, and \"struggled to hold on to what little she earned.\" In fact, the pro-choice side had paid her for public appearances, too, but she never got rich off either movement. You don't get the impression that McCorvey was purposefully lying to activists on either side. When she decided that people were being high and mighty with her, it was enough to send her skittering back and forth across what seemed to others like profound dividing lines of conscience and belief. She just doesn't seem to have cared all that much about reproductive rights. McCorvey, speaking of her defection to the anti-abortion camp, told Prager, \"I was lonely for some excitement. I needed to do something that would cause media attention. Isn't that awful?\"\n\nPrager got an astonishing array of people to talk to him for this book-from short-term girlfriends of McCorvey's to the son of Henry Wade, the Dallas D.A. who was Roe's legal antagonist and who, we learn here, was secretly pro-choice. The book is most compelling, though, when it's relating the personal saga of a woman and her family caught in the gears of history. Prager brings in two characters beyond McCorvey's orbit-Mildred Jefferson, an African American pro-life leader, and Curtis Boyd, a doctor who provided abortions before and after Roe-but their stories don't add much to the narrative. Its drive comes from Prager's efforts to track down the three daughters whom McCorvey gave up for adoption.\n\nWhat he learns about these women doesn't cohere into a neat takeaway, although it's notable that all three tell him they are pro-choice. The oldest, who was partly raised by Norma's mother and sister, and who knew Norma, yearns for a deep family bond with her two half sisters and hopes that they'll find a way to accept their mother. The middle sister, who most resembles McCorvey and is, like her, a lesbian, is more interested in information about her biological parents than in a relationship with them. The youngest, the so-called Roe baby, was identified by a pro-life private detective shortly before her nineteenth birthday, laying the groundwork for a National Enquirer story. Until then, she had pretended that her real parents were Ann-Margret and Elvis Presley, and she tells Prager that she wishes she'd never learned the facts of her birth. The sisters' lives are ordinary, zigzagging between rough passages (depression, divorce, domestic abuse, addiction) and periods of fulfillment (going back to school, loving a job at a florist's, meeting a nice new guy or gal, embracing stay-at-home motherhood). And yet, because their biological mother happens to have been Jane Roe, they are also extraordinary. It's like a fairy tale set in working-class America, each sister carrying a secret and a curse.\n\nWould a different Jane Roe have changed the way the case has been perceived over the years? Reading \"The Family Roe,\" you wonder whether someone other than McCorvey might have been a better fit for the role, and whether she might have been served better by sidestepping it. The one thing McCorvey had wanted when she went to see the lawyers she'd been referred to was an abortion-and she never got it. Weddington and Coffee do seem to have told her that, by the time her case made it to court, it would almost certainly be too late to end the pregnancy. But they did not help her to get an abortion, and, as Prager notes, they could at least have tried. Weddington had worked with a service that referred people seeking abortions to clinics in California (where it was legal) and in Mexico (where it was quasi-legal). She herself had obtained an abortion in Mexico a few years earlier.\n\nLink copied\n\nWeddington was only twenty-six when she argued Roe in front of the Supreme Court. The prevailing atmosphere was so sexist that the Texas assistant attorney general prefaced his argument with a lame quip about the difficulty of facing off against \"such beautiful ladies.\" There is much to admire about her: she went on to win a seat in the state legislature, to write a memoir about the case, and to become a popular speaker on college campuses. But Prager says that in early interviews Weddington made it sound as if McCorvey had decided to carry her pregnancy to term to make sure she would still have standing, thereby saving the case. In fact, Prager writes, \"Norma had shown no such valor.\" Coffee gets a more sympathetic treatment, perhaps in part because Weddington declined to talk to Prager, and in part because Coffee had a much lower profile for decades. By the time Prager located her, she had been acquitted of fraud charges (after allegedly forging a client's signature) and suspended by the Texas bar a few times, when she got behind on her licensing payments. She was living quietly with her partner in a small town in East Texas, where it was not easy to be open about her gay identity. Her finances were precarious enough that she relied on a local food bank. When she was invited, with Weddington, to a pro-choice fund-raising event in 2019, the former partners in history-making hadn't seen each other in twenty-seven years.\n\nBy the time the pro-life movement took McCorvey aboard, anti-abortion activists had widened their focus from the vulnerable fetus to the woman carrying it-who, they argued, would be morally, emotionally, and physically damaged by an abortion. The purported damage ranged from regret to a constellation of woes called \"post-abortion syndrome.\" Ronald Reagan's Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was tasked with collecting evidence of P.A.S., but admitted that he couldn't find any. Evidence of routine regret was also lacking. A large-scale study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that, five years out, the vast majority of women who had undergone an abortion said it had been the right choice for them. In any case, regret is a dubious basis for policy. People regret all kinds of decisions, large and small, but we don't proactively deprive them of their decision-making agency on the chance that they might. The anti-abortion movement made McCorvey into a sad-eyed embodiment of tormenting second thoughts. Here, after all, was the very woman whose pregnancy had legalized abortion, now decrying it. But the regret McCorvey expressed time and again was about not getting an abortion-she even shared that sentiment with a reporter sent to cover her born-again baptism.\n\nThere had been other possible plaintiffs, other possible routes to the Supreme Court. As a young litigator with the A.C.L.U., Ruth Bader Ginsburg had hoped that the Court's first abortion case would be one in which she was representing a woman seeking not to have an abortion. The woman was Susan Struck, a nurse in the Air Force who became pregnant in 1970, while serving in Vietnam. The military gave her two choices: have an abortion or be immediately discharged. (Though illegal in most states, abortion was allowed on military bases.) The Supreme Court agreed to hear Struck v. Secretary of Defense, but in the meantime the Air Force, realizing that it would likely lose, overturned the policy. An opinion in the Struck case, Ginsburg believed, would have anchored the right to have an abortion-like the right not to have one-in the notion of equality. A whole class of people could not be denied equal treatment under the law simply because they were subject to the condition of pregnancy.\n\n\"The Family Roe\" tells us that Weddington and Coffee, hedging their bets against the possibility that Norma would drop out of the suit, had challenged the Texas abortion law on behalf of another plaintiff as well. Her name was Marsha King, and she was, Prager writes, \"unlike Norma in almost every way.\" A married engineer with an advanced degree in physics, King had talked openly about the importance of abortion rights ever since having a gruelling procedure herself, in Mexico. She was in ill health and didn't want to risk getting pregnant again, but, because she wasn't currently pregnant, the Texas court that heard the case found she didn't have standing. Even so, there might have been many other candidates like King. By 1970, there had been speak-outs where women came forward in public forums to talk about their own fears of unwanted pregnancy and their experiences with illegal abortionists. These were feminists attuned to the wider significance of legalizing abortion, more committed to a cause than to their own immediate self-interest.\n\nIn the years since Roe, some civil-rights lawyers seem to have sought out appealing, well-spoken clients, with a history of activism or at least developed opinions on the issue at stake. That was true, for instance, of most of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits seeking to legalize same-sex marriage, who were upstanding embodiments of respectability politics-monogamous, middle class, sometimes devotedly caring for a disabled partner. Projecting a sort of \"disdain for politics\" was often part of the package, as Cynthia Godsoe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, points out in an essay called \"Perfect Plaintiffs.\" Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the case that established same-sex marriage, told reporters, \"No one could ever accuse us of being activists. . . . We just lived our lives.\" Still, Godsoe writes, \"several had been involved in previous LGB advocacy; all were attractive candidates for careful recruitment by cause lawyers.\" A belief in the mission and the support of other people who believe in it can gird a person for a long, public fight, making things easier on the client, emotionally, and on the larger movement, politically.\n\nAnd yet a plaintiff's character or commitment doesn't necessarily matter to the outcome of the case. It was easy to love the Lovings, the plaintiffs in Loving v. Virginia (1967), which legalized interracial marriage across the country. Their lawyers could accurately present them as ordinary, apolitical rural folks, a couple who loved each other and simply wanted to live together quietly and legally. Yet, as Godsoe notes, these dream clients with the dream name came to their lawyers by \"happenstance.\" John Lawrence, of Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the landmark Supreme Court case that overturned sodomy laws, was nobody's idea of a dream plaintiff. He had displayed no interest in gay-rights activism, and he had a previous conviction for vehicular homicide. One night, the police invaded his home without a warrant and arrested him for having sex with another man. Lawrence's partner wasn't even his lover, as the law professor Dale Carpenter revealed in his book on the case, \"Flagrant Conduct.\" But arrests for sodomy in Texas were rare, so this one offered a valuable opportunity to challenge a set of assumptions behind legal anti-gay discrimination. McCorvey's main qualification, too, was being in the right place in the right condition at the right time, and being willing to sign an affidavit.\n\nThose of us who are pro-choice may be tempted to sigh over Roe v. Wade, wondering how it could have been different. Maybe, as Justice Ginsburg believed, it would have been better to ground the right to abortion in equality rather than in privacy. You can see the pitfalls of a \"my body, my choice\" absolutism-or a caricature of it-in the anti-vaccine and anti-mask movements of today. Many feminist thinkers now argue for a more inclusive, and potentially sturdier, defense of abortion rights in what's often called reproductive justice. It embraces the freedom to have children, with adequate social supports to raise them, as well as the freedom to postpone or prevent childbearing. That would mean, as Reva Siegel, a law professor at Yale, has put it, looking beyond abortion and asking, \"What are all the ways that law impinges on-empowers or disempowers-people in their intimate and their family lives?\"\n\nOn the other hand, Justice Blackmun's elaboration of a constitutional right to privacy, the assertion that there are areas of intimate life on which the state cannot encroach, has been important in subsequent decisions governing the right to marry whom one chooses, and in the understanding of human rights more generally. And the backlash argument-that it was the judicial overreach of Roe that created this country's long-lasting division over abortion-deserves at least an asterisk. There's no doubt that Roe exerted what Prager describes as a galvanizing effect on anti-abortion activists. It has been a mainstay of evangelical politics for decades, and all the more offensive to some because it could be attributed to what Antonin Scalia called \"the black-robed supremacy\" on the federal bench. Yet Siegel and Linda Greenhouse, a former Supreme Court reporter for the Times , have dug into the backlash claim and provided a set of complicating facts. Polling on the eve of Roe showed that a \"substantial majority\" of Americans favored decriminalizing abortion, including two-thirds of self-identified Republicans and fifty-six per cent of Catholics. But, they write, \"despite broad popular support, liberalization of abortion law had all but come to a halt in the face of concerted opposition by a Catholic-led minority.\" Republicans began stoking opposition to abortion as part of a strategy to lure working-class Catholic voters and Southerners who were alienated by the Democratic Party's outreach to minorities, by the counterculture, and by the women's movement. In Greenhouse and Siegel's view, there is nothing uniquely backlash-inducing about a judicial, as opposed to a legislative, extension of rights.\n\nAs for McCorvey herself, precisely because of her ambivalence she was, in significant ways, a highly representative and therefore inadvertently eloquent plaintiff. As Prager writes, \"If Norma was uncomfortable with the increasing surety and absolutism of both movements, she was hardly alone.\" By the end of her life, she occupied what she called \"the mushy middle,\" supporting, as many Americans do, abortion rights but with some limits. And the fact that she did not want to be a parent was certainly related to what Ginsburg called \"the right to control her own destiny.\" Her topsy-turvy life is a reminder, too, that if the personal is the political, the political is also the personal, driven by inconsistency and exigency.\n\nMcCorvey wanted an abortion at a time when some women could fly to California or Oregon or Mexico to get one and others could not. She simply didn't have the money. Today, more than half of those who have abortions live below the federal poverty line. And they are the ones who will suffer if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Women will always seek to end unwanted pregnancies, as they have throughout history, and throughout the world, regardless of what the law says. Indeed, doing so is easier now than ever, given the availability of reliable abortion-inducing drugs that can be taken at home and are increasingly provided by online services. People of means seeking abortions will be able to travel to states that have strengthened their own laws to make sure the procedure can still be offered there. Women short on funds, or information, or child care, or the ability to take time off from work will be out of luck and, if they do find a way to end an unwanted pregnancy, more vulnerable to prosecution. Norma McCorvey's obituary in the Washington Post ended, aptly, with something she said in 1994: \"I don't require that much in my life. I just never had the privilege to go into an abortion clinic, lay down, and have an abortion. That's the only thing I never had.\" In that way, McCorvey was the perfect plaintiff-a harbinger of things to come. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Supreme Court and the Future of Roe v. Wade\n\nOne of the more dubious assumptions undergirding the latest assault on reproductive rights in this country is the idea that abortion is a kind of niche procedure for which there isn't much need, and for which there will be even less need in some unspecified future. ­Defending the new Texas law that bans abortion after about six weeks, making no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape, Governor Greg Abbott explained that this restriction won't be a problem, because he plans to \"eliminate rape\" in the state. In the next few months, the Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after fifteen weeks. That case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, is widely viewed as an opportunity for the Justices, if they so choose, to overturn the nearly fifty-year-old precedent set by Roe v. Wade .\n\nMississippi's brief to uphold its law offers, among other rationales, the assertion that women's lives are so much freer, more equal, and more replete with birth-control options now than they were in 1973, when Roe legalized the right to abortion nationwide, that we can let that right go by the wayside. \"Modern options regarding and views about childbearing have dulled concerns on which Roe rested,\" state officials claim-namely, that unwanted pregnancies were hard on women and on their prospects in life. But the Mississippi brief says that everything is different now: laws addressing pregnancy discrimination and offering family leave \"facilitate the ability of women to pursue both career success and a rich family life.\" They add that, although \"abortion may once have been thought critical as an ­alternative to contraception,\" this is no longer the case, since birth control is more available and reliable.\n\nThe errors of fact and judgment in this patronizing argument are staggering. The United States, alone among industrialized nations, does not mandate paid family leave. The major advances in women's access to careers and to the public sphere have occurred since the early nineteen-seventies, when abortion was legalized, and it's quite likely that the two developments had something to do with each other. Furthermore, even in an egalitarian society with reliable access to contraception and to child care for all, people will still want, and should be able to exercise, agency over the intimate, life-transforming decisions of when, or whether, to have children. Many people will still feel a need to end pregnancies for reasons-health risks and crises, destructive or failed relationships, personal economic hardship, the needs of other children-that have little to do with prevailing social conditions.\n\nIt's true that the most recent data show that rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion have declined since the early two-thousands, but both remain common. Nearly one in four women will have had an abortion by the time she is forty-­five, according to an analysis by the Gutt­macher Institute. The procedure that anti-­abortion lawyers want to portray as an unnecessary and outmoded privilege (and a shameful one) is a form of medical care that hundreds of thousands of people turn to each year, low-income people in particular. (Half of all abortions are obtained by people living below the federal poverty line.) Not everybody can afford or obtain reliable birth control. And, ­despite Abbott's absurd claim, there will always be people who become pregnant through coerced unprotected sex.\n\nConsistently preventing pregnancy during the reproductive life span isn't so easy, and that span has been getting longer. The lawyer and bioethics professor Katie Watson has estimated that a fertile woman who has sex with a man regularly throughout her reproductive years will have to dodge up to twenty-­nine pregnancies if she wants to have just two children and avoid an abortion. That's a lot of contraceptive efficacy to rely on. Moreover, plenty of evidence shows that restrictions on abortion do not end the practice. The need remains, and women find a way to meet it, though this sometimes requires ingenuity, along with legal and physical risk-taking. People in exigent circumstances shouldn't have to contend with such challenges.\n\nAll these facts of life are important to acknowledge, because anti-abortion lawyers are intent on erasing them. Mississippi claims that no \"legitimate reliance interests call for retaining Roe and Casey,\" the 1992 Supreme Court ruling that upheld a constitutional right to abortion while allowing states to impose limits before the stage of fetal viability. The state also says that Justices needn't worry about stare decisis-the principle that would encourage them to respect legal precedent-or about the impact on people's lives if Roe is tossed out. Abortion-law jurisprudence, the petitioners write, has always been \"fractured and unsettled,\" and the \"Court is not in a position to gauge\" how reliant society is on abortion. But, as the lawyers representing the lead respondent-the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi-point out, the Court has heard multiple abortion cases since Roe and, while it has allowed states to chip away at the constitutional right to abortion, it has also clearly upheld the core finding.\n\nThe Court that will consider the Mississippi law-the first major abortion case since Amy Coney Barrett replaced Ruth Bader Ginsburg-is composed of three liberals and six conservatives, three of them appointed by Donald Trump. Barrett, as a law professor at Notre Dame, signed a petition denouncing abortion. Clarence Thomas has openly declared his disdain for Roe. The best hope for retaining abortion rights might be if Chief Justice John Roberts and at least one other conservative decide that overturning Roe is too much of a blow to settled doctrine, or that it would make the Court look too nakedly political. Roberts has shown a penchant for this kind of thinking; the others, less so. (Last week, Barrett, while speaking at the ­McConnell Center, at the University of Louisville-named for the Republican senator who rushed through her confirmation-maintained that the Court is never partisan.)\n\nStare decisis is meant to protect not just institutions but also citizens who have come to depend on certain rights. Access to abortion, for all the dug-in objections to it, is one such right, and most Americans want to retain it. As Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, and David Souter wrote for the plurality in Casey, \"The ability of women to participate in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.\" That was true in 1992; it is no less true in 2021. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The end of Roe v. Wade, explained\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nRoe v. Wade is now overruled. Are access to contraception, same-sex marriage, and even the right to choose your own sex partners next?\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nRoe v. Wade is overruled . The Republican Party, which achieved a generational victory when it captured a supermajority of the Supreme Court's seats under former President Donald Trump, has now capitalized on that victory to achieve one of its longtime political goals. The half-century when American constitutional law protected a right to an abortion is now over.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is substantially similar to a leaked early draft of that opinion , which was published by Politico in early May. Alito's opinion was joined by the Court's four most conservative members. Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative who often takes a more incrementalist approach than Alito, wrote a separate opinion arguing that the Court should limit but not yet overrule Roe .\n\nAlito's final opinion doesn't just allow Mississippi to enact the 15-week abortion ban at issue in Dobbs - a ban that violated Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 opinion that weakened Roe while retaining the constitutional right to an abortion up to the point of \"viability.\" Alito's opinion goes further, and concludes that Roe and Casey \"must be overruled.\" It is written in Alito's characteristically snide tone , repeatedly referring to abortion providers by the pejorative term \"abortionists.\" And it rests on a conservative theory that limits which rights are protected by the Constitution.\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\" Alito writes.\n\nAccording to Alito, if a right isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, it must be \"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'\" to qualify for constitutional protection. He then spends many pages of his opinion arguing that the right to an abortion is not rooted in legal history or tradition.\n\nMuch of Alito's account of this history is dubious. The Roe opinion itself argued that, under English \"common law,\" which still forms the basis for much of US law, \" abortion performed before 'quickening' - the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy - was not an indictable offense.\" And there is considerable historical evidence that a right to pre-quickening abortions is, indeed, firmly rooted in US legal history and tradition.\n\nUltimately, however, Alito's opinion is less a triumph of one theory of history over another, than it is the triumph of one political party over another. Roe was overruled because Republicans appointed six justices and Democrats appointed only three. This outcome became inevitable the minute Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in the final weeks of a Republican presidency.\n\nSo what happens now? The immediate impact is that the many state laws that already ban abortion - either outright or very early in a pregnancy - will quickly take effect . Many clinics in the states with the most rigid laws suspended abortion procedures as soon as the Dobbs opinion came down .\n\nThere's also an open question about whether other rights, such as the right to same-sex marriage or the right to contraception , are in danger. Many of the Court's decisions protecting a right to sexual, romantic, or bodily autonomy rely on similar reasoning to Roe . And Alito's reasoning in the Dobbs opinion closely tracks reasoning he once used to argue that same-sex marriage is not rooted in American legal history and tradition. In other words, the logic Alito uses in Dobbs could be used to target other rights.\n\nThat said, Alito's Dobbs opinion does contain language denying that overruling Roe necessarily means the demise of other, still-existing freedoms. Alito declares abortion to be a \"unique act\" because it \"terminates 'life or potential life.'\" That distinguishes the now-defunct constitutional right to abortion from, say, the right to marry a person of the same sex.\n\nThis is one of the largest changes from the leaked opinion in May, which did contain some language suggesting that the Dobbs opinion is limited to abortion, but not nearly as much as the final version. That suggests that at least one of the justices who joined Alito's opinions might have reckoned with the earlier draft's sweeping repercussions and pushed for a slightly less aggressive opinion.\n\nBut whether other rights are next on the chopping block or not, Dobbs is already a sweeping change for America, one that will immediately change society not just in the states likely to ban abortion, but across the country.\n\nEighteen states currently have laws on the books that either ban abortion outright or permit it only in extremely limited circumstances. Some, but not all, of these states permit abortion to save a patient's life or protect them from a dire health consequence. Some, but not all, permit the termination of a pregnancy that results from rape or incest.\n\nMany of these laws are now in effect, after the Court's decision overruling Roe , but some of these states have \"trigger\" provisions that do not take effect until a certain condition is met - such as that 30 days have passed after the Dobbs decision. That means abortion may remain briefly legal in a few states with trigger laws, but that the bans will most likely take effect by the end of the summer.\n\nThe 18 states with near-total bans on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nFour other states - Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina - have laws on the books banning abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy , which is before many people who may want an abortion will be aware that they are pregnant. (There's also the unusual case of North Carolina, which once had an abortion ban on the books. But a more recent law appears to have legalized abortion up to the 20th week of pregnancy.)\n\nIt should be noted that this list of states will fluctuate. State supreme courts retain the power to interpret their own state constitutions, potentially to protect a right to abortion within their state's borders. In Michigan, for example, a judge has temporarily blocked the state's ban from taking effect , and the litigation continues. Given that Democrats currently hold a narrow majority on the state's highest court, the state could protect the right to an abortion.\n\nAnd, of course, Alito's opinion also means that state legislatures can pass new laws regulating or banning abortion. That means states currently controlled by Republicans are likely to enact new bans in the coming weeks or months.\n\nAlito's Dobbs opinion acknowledges that the Constitution protects some rights that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, but only rights that are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"\n\nHe's made this argument before . Specifically, Alito made this \"history and tradition\" argument in his dissenting opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the landmark opinion holding that people with same-sex partners have the same right to marry that partner as anyone else. \"It is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage\" is not sufficiently rooted in history and tradition, Alito claimed in his Obergefell dissent.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, meanwhile, wrote a concurring opinion in Dobbs where he denounced the concept of \"substantive due process,\" the legal theory that drives many of the Court's decisions involving a right to sexual and romantic autonomy. Alito also rejects the idea that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment implies the right to an abortion. But Thomas goes further.\n\nAccording to Thomas's opinion, which is joined by no other justice, the Court's pro-contraception decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), its decision in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) that consenting adults have a right to choose whom they have sex with and how they have sex, and its decision in Obergefell should all be reconsidered.\n\nThat said, the final version of Alito's opinion seems to go out of its way to explain that abortion is different from these other rights - again, because abortion involves the termination of a fetal life and these other rights do not. Much of this language was added after Alito wrote the leaked early draft of the Dobbs opinion.\n\nIndeed, Alito accuses the dissenting opinion - which is co-authored by all three of the Court's Democratic appointees - of stoking \"unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights\" because the dissent worries that Dobbs could endanger things like same-sex marriage or contraception.\n\nIn any event, the future of rights other than abortion will likely need to be litigated. There is no doubt that Thomas would happily light many existing rights on fire . And there is little doubt that Alito, based on his Obergefell dissent, would also happily tear down same-sex marriage.\n\nBut it takes five votes to strip away an existing constitutional right, and it remains to be seen whether Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - conservatives who sometimes break with Alito's most aggressive attempts to drive the law to the right - will support mass rollbacks of existing rights.\n\nAlthough there may not be five votes on the current Supreme Court to permit an outright ban on all forms of contraception, the Court may permit states to ban certain forms of contraception that many religious conservatives believe to be akin to abortion.\n\nIn Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), a 5-4 Supreme Court held that employers who object to certain forms of birth control on religious grounds may refuse to cover these contraceptive methods in their employees' health plans. At least some of the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby claimed that \"two forms of emergency contraception commonly called 'morning after' pills and two types of intrauterine devices\" can cause an abortion because they \"may operate after the fertilization of an egg.\"\n\nIt is far from clear that these forms of birth control actually do operate on fertilized eggs. As Dr. Mary Jacobson, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at Alpha Medical , told me, \"No existing scientific studies validate the fallacy that hormonal contraceptives or the copper intrauterine device act partly as abortifacients.\"\n\nBut the question of whether IUDs or morning-after pills qualify as contraception (which is still protected by existing Supreme Court precedents) or abortion-inducing drugs (which are not protected after Dobbs ) will not be decided by medical doctors. It will be decided by a federal judiciary dominated by conservative Republicans.\n\nIn Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), moreover, the Supreme Court held that state and federal lawmakers have \"wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.\" This line is likely to play a starring role in conservative judicial decisions permitting bans on certain forms of contraception.\n\nUnder Gonzales , to justify a contraception ban, a state does not need to prove that a particular form of contraception definitively acts as an abortion-inducing drug. They just have to convince a court that may be dominated by right-wing Republicans that there is \"uncertainty\" about how a pill or contraceptive device operates.\n\nLitigation over contraception bans, in other words, is inevitable if a state decides to ban common forms of birth control such as the morning-after pill or IUDs.\n\nAbortion opponents will no doubt feel emboldened by their victory in Dobbs , and will try to press their advantage.\n\nOne of the most aggressive anti-abortion theories is known as \" fetal personhood .\" It claims that a fetus is entitled to the same rights as a fully born human being. And thus the law must treat killing a fetus the same as a homicide.\n\nCould this theory gain purchase in this Supreme Court? Based solely on the text of the Dobbs opinion, the answer is \"no.\" Alito claims that his decision \"returns the issue of abortion to ... legislative bodies\" and allows people with varying opinions on abortion to \"affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.\"\n\nAlito, of course, is notoriously hostile to the right to vote . Among other things, he is the author of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee (2021), an opinion that invented a number of judicially created limits on the Voting Rights Act that appear nowhere in the law's text. So, if Alito's Dobbs opinion does permit voters to shape abortion policy moving forward, it will do so only after Alito has skewed the electorate toward Republicans.\n\nA second caveat worth considering is that the Court recently tripped over itself to ensure that Texas's SB 8 law, an unusual ban on most abortions that relies on private litigation to enforce the ban, could take effect. (Now Dobbs permits Texas to ban abortions outright.)\n\nThe Court's decision in that case, Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson (2021), didn't simply shield SB 8 from judicial review. If taken seriously, Jackson 's reasoning would permit a state to nullify any constitutional right by writing a law with a similar enforcement mechanism as SB 8 .\n\nThe Court, in other words, was willing to do considerable violence to the Constitution as a whole in order to spite abortion rights in Jackson . That suggests that five justices may be willing to take similarly extraordinary steps to restrict abortion in the future.\n\nFor the time being, however, the Court's most recent pronouncement on abortion rights is Dobbs. And Dobbs , at least on its face, is inconsistent with the theory of fetal personhood.\n\nAt least for now, in other words, abortion is likely to remain legal in blue states.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Vox Staff\n\nThe US Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Now the matter will be settled on a state-by-state basis, with 22 states likely to quickly ban all or nearly all abortions .\n\nThe road to the decision began when the state of Mississippi enacted a law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state's law violated the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) that pregnant people have a right to terminate their pregnancy up until the point when the fetus is \"viable.\" But Justice Samuel Alito's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturns that standard and Roe .\n\nAlito's opinion is similar to a draft opinion obtained and published by Politico in May - a largely unprecedented leak that rattled the Court and the nation. But even before the leak, the conservative supermajority on the Court had repeatedly signaled they were willing to overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortions .\n\nFollow here for all of Vox's coverage on the ruling, the state of abortion rights nationwide, reaction, analysis, and more.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nFor 49 years after Roe v. Wade , Americans had the right to obtain an abortion if they became pregnant. Then, two years ago, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court put an end to it.\n\nThe Biden administration and some blue states - supported by a network of nonprofits focused on reproductive care - aggressively sought to compensate, while many red states enacted near-total bans on abortion.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nIt's been nearly one year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion via the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health decision. In the months since, abortion access has been mostly banned in 14 states , stringent gestational limits have been put in place in several others, and the approval of medication abortion has been challenged in the federal courts.\n\nSuch policies have left both patients and providers scrambling to navigate harsh new restrictions and penalties. For many patients, these policies have meant traveling out of state, incurring serious risks to their own health, and in some cases, carrying unwanted pregnancies to term . For providers, the end of Roe has meant fears of being punished for providing abortions, possible discipline from state medical boards , and, in states where abortion remains legal, an influx of patients from other places.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nThe US Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has raised the stakes of competitive governor's races in 2022, with Democratic and Republican candidates advocating for competing visions of abortion access.\n\nIn some states, Democrats hope to wield veto power over legislation from Republican-controlled state legislatures that want to curb abortion rights. Elsewhere, Republicans want to use governorships to defend existing state laws restricting abortion and are charting a path to further curb access to the procedure.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nEarlier this year, five people altered the landscape of reproductive rights in more than a dozen states across the country when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade . In November, millions of voters will weigh in, casting votes in dozens of races and ballot measures that will determine how restrictive their state can be.\n\nBallot initiatives in three states could determine abortion access for millions of women and what kind of reproductive health care is available to them. Abortion has also become a key issue in races for governor and state attorneys general, who have direct control over their states' abortion laws and how they are enforced.\n\nRani Molla\n\nOn Tuesday, an unprecedented number of Kansans voted against a constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to end abortion protections. That's a big win for women's rights, but the outcome also carries major implications for elections nationwide this November. It's especially true in those states where abortion rights are on the ballot after the overturning of Roe Vs. Wade and where Democrats are seeking to stay in power.\n\nContrary to what some conservatives had thought , abortion is an issue that can mobilize voters.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nKansans voted decisively against a ballot measure on Tuesday that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which could have severely limited abortion access in the region.\n\nThe measure, known as the \" Value Them Both Amendment ,\" was defeated 59 to 41 percent (as of Wednesday morning). The campaign director of Kansans for Constitutional Freedom , the pro-abortion rights group that worked to sink the amendment, hailed their victory as \"truly an historic day for Kansas and an historic day for America.\" Value Them Both , the group that backed the amendment, promised to ensure their loss is just \"a temporary setback.\"\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nA month after the Supreme Court's decision overruling Roe v. Wade , it's unclear whether many patients with dangerous pregnancies can receive medically necessary abortions. Some women have traveled to other states for lifesaving care because doctors in their home state feared prosecution. Others were left to bleed by their health care providers who feared they couldn't legally provide care that would stop it.\n\nA lawsuit , filed by the Justice Department on Tuesday, could alleviate at least some of these cases - and potentially provide legal clarity to doctors who want to perform medically necessary abortions but fear being hauled off to prison if they do. The case is United States v. Idaho .\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nThe case of a 10-year-old Ohio rape survivor who traveled to Indiana to obtain an abortion drew national attention to Ohio's near-total abortion ban, which does not allow abortions even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nOhio isn't unusual. Despite broad agreement among Americans that victims of rape should be allowed to obtain an abortion, nearly all of the states with abortion bans do not make exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nSara Morrison\n\nRep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) uses a period-tracking app. So do many of her friends and constituents, who messaged her about those apps after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade leaked. Major privacy concerns with period tracking apps emerged earlier this year, as the possibility that abortion could become illegal in certain parts of the country loomed. That's when Jacobs realized many people didn't know what they were supposed to do to keep their online data private.\n\n\"I realized each individual person shouldn't have to figure this out on their own,\" Jacobs told Recode. \"It's our job as a government to protect this very sensitive and personal data.\"\n\nAllie Volpe\n\nIn the weeks since the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , in which the court ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, questions concerning access to contraceptives in the United States have proliferated. How does the ruling impact birth control? Do states have the power to limit access or ban specific types of contraceptives?\n\nAs of mid-July, \"things have not changed as of right now,\" says Mara Gandal-Powers , the director of birth control access at the National Women's Law Center . \"Everyone still has the constitutional right to birth control. Insurance coverage has not changed for birth control.\"\n\nLi Zhou\n\nAs a fiery viral speech she gave earlier this year made clear, Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow isn't one to mince her words - and she doesn't want other Democrats to do so either .\n\nMcMorrow thinks her party can be a lot more explicit when fighting GOP attacks , particularly as they struggle to defend their congressional majorities and retake state legislatures this fall .\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nMethotrexate is a fairly common drug that treats a wide range of medical conditions. I take it to help control an autoimmune disorder. So do about 60 percent of rheumatoid arthritis patients . It is used to treat some cancers , such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It also has at least one other important medical use.\n\nThe drug is the most common pharmaceutical treatment for ectopic pregnancies , a life-threatening medical condition where a fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus - typically a fallopian tube. If allowed to develop, this egg can eventually cause a rupture and massive internal bleeding. Methotrexate prevents embryonic cell growth, eventually terminating an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nEmily St. James\n\nIn the immediate wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade , social media filled with images and memes playing off a viral tweet : A clean-cut couple beams at the camera while standing outside the Supreme Court building and holding a sign reading \"We will adopt your baby.\" (Slate has the full story on the couple featured in that photo.)\n\nIn a post- Roe world, there is already a renewed focus on adoption as a supposed solution for unwanted pregnancies. Indeed, in the arguments before the Supreme Court last year, Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested that adoption is a foolproof substitution for abortion. Yet the rhetoric around adoption too rarely takes into consideration the person having the baby who will be adopted.\n\nMiranda Dixon-Luinenburg\n\nPopular culture tends to focus on a few elements of pregnancy: morning sickness , the growing baby bump , and, of course, mood swings . But that ignores more dangerous, less well-known conditions associated with pregnancy. Up to 10 percent of pregnant US women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes and uncontrolled high blood sugar; untreated, this can result in a difficult delivery, and risks developing into Type 2 diabetes years later. Meanwhile, 2 to 8 percent of women worldwide have symptoms of preeclampsia , a condition involving high blood pressure that can lead to fatal seizures if untreated, can damage the mother's organs, and increases the risk of chronic disease later in life for the baby.\n\nBut even a supposedly normal, healthy pregnancy with no complications can lead to a lot more than just morning nausea. And the ordeal isn't over when the baby is born; pregnancy changes one's body permanently, and labor is often traumatic. If it weren't taken for granted as a natural part of life, pregnancy could easily be considered a chronic illness or disability . Women with pregnancy-related impairments are legally a protected class under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act .\n\nNicole Narea and Li Zhou\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade , Democrats have repeatedly proposed the same solution: voting in the midterms .\n\n\"If you want to change the circumstances for women and ... girls in this country, please go out and vote,\" President Joe Biden emphasized in a speech on Friday . \"For God's sake, there's an election in November.\"\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nIn his decision overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , Justice Samuel Alito argues that the rulings that had protected abortion rights were not only poorly reasoned but actively harmful to American democracy.\n\n\"Far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,\" Alito writes in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health . \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nEmily Stewart\n\nCompanies stepping up to say that they will support their workers in accessing abortions after the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Roe v. Wade raises questions both logistical and existential. For example, do you really want to ask your boss at Dick's Sporting Goods for $4,000 and a couple of days off to terminate a pregnancy? If you start to think about the situation beyond the press release, it can get pretty disturbing pretty quickly. It reinforces how supremely screwed up the entire post- Roe situation is, as well as the setup of the United States health care system.\n\n\"It's better than nothing, I'm not going to say it's bad,\" said Kate Bahn, director of labor market policy and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"It's a Band-Aid on a stab wound.\"\n\nAnna North\n\nWhen the last abortion clinic in Texas closes its doors for good , Prestonwood Pregnancy Center will remain.\n\nSo will Agape, with locations in Round Rock, Austin, Cedar Park, and Taylor. So will the Pregnancy Help Center, operating in Texas's Brazoria County since 1990.\n\nLi Zhou\n\nThis past weekend, more than 30 Democratic senators had a message for President Joe Biden: They want him to do more to protect abortion rights, and they want him to do it now.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" they said in the letter, which was led by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and sent one day after the Supreme Court announced its decision to officially roll back Roe v. Wade . \"You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision.\"\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nEditor's note, June 26: The following is an updated version of an essay that originally ran in Vox in May. We are republishing it with revisions in light of the Supreme Court's decision overruling Roe v. Wade .\n\nIn an 1832 case called Worcester v. Georgia , the Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation constituted a sovereign entity with rights in its territory that cannot be overruled by state governments. President Andrew Jackson, who supported the seizure of Native lands, was infuriated by Chief Justice John Marshall's ruling, reportedly saying that \"Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\"\n\nSara Morrison\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has made abortion illegal in many parts of the United States, with a possible future where it's illegal everywhere. The pervasive and barely regulated data collection industry could have a big role to play in investigating and proving cases against people accused of performing or getting abortions.\n\nA lot of data is readily available if law enforcement wants it because there's very little, legally, restricting its collection. And we know the police use that data all the time, getting it through court order or by simply buying it. Through your phone and your computer, they can find out where you go, who you interact with, what you say, what you search the internet for, which websites you visit, and what apps you download.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nThe US Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Now the matter will be settled on a state-by-state basis, with 22 states likely to quickly ban all or nearly all abortions .\n\nEven before the Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Friday, Republican state legislatures across the country had been forging ahead with new bans and restrictions, in anticipation of the decision.\n\nJillian Weinberger\n\nIn 1976, just a few years after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in Roe v. Wade , most Americans thought abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances.\n\nThose numbers haven't changed much over almost 50 years. Most Americans still believe abortion should be legal in most circumstances . But our politics have shifted dramatically. And with the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - which effectively overturned Roe - reality has shifted as well. No longer is abortion protected at the federal level.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nThe Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade is a development of enormous political and social consequence, one that could could almost immediately trigger tectonic changes in health and well-being.\n\nWe know this due to important research published in 2020 that compared the fates of women who were forced to carry pregnancies to term versus those who were provided abortions. The influential Turnaway Study, as it's commonly known, found that, among other things, women who were denied an abortion endured more serious pregnancy complications, more chronic pain, and more short-term anxiety.\n\nAja Romano\n\nOn the weekend of May 7, protesters angered by the leaked draft of a pending Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade assembled in front of Supreme Court justices' houses. A crowd of a few hundred people first gathered at the house of Justice Brett Kavanaugh before moving over to Chief Justice John Roberts, who lives in the same Chevy Chase, Maryland, neighborhood. The crowd then headed back to Kavanaugh's house while police guarded properties.\n\nWhile the protest was peaceful, it caused a firestorm online, where some liberals joined conservatives in condemning the protesters for entering these neighborhoods. On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki released a statement apparently decrying the very idea of protesting the justices. Protesting \"should never include violence, threats, or vandalism,\" Psaki stated on behalf of President Biden. \"Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Constitution doesn't tell us which rights it protects, and now the power to decide that question rests with people like Samuel Alito.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nI believe that the Constitution protects a right to abortion.\n\nI want to state that upfront because the rest of this essay will be highly critical of the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade , and of the open-ended approach to constitutional interpretation exemplified by that decision. As I will argue below, the right to an abortion should be found within the Constitution's promise of gender equality - an approach which does far more to limit judicial power than the Roe opinion itself.\n\nRoe, the landmark case that first established a constitutional right to abortion, rested on the idea that judges have a practically unlimited power to find rights within the Constitution that aren't mentioned anywhere within it. The 1973 decision found the right to abortion within a broader \"right of privacy,\" which itself was found within \"the 14th Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action.\"\n\nThe legal name for this kind of constitutional analysis is \"substantive due process.\" It refers to the theory that certain unenumerated rights - rights that are never explicitly mentioned in the Constitution - are nonetheless implicit in a passage of the 14th Amendment providing that no one shall be denied \"liberty\" without \"due process of law.\"\n\nSubstantive due process is best known now as the bedrock of many of the most celebrated progressive Supreme Court victories in the last several decades. In addition to Roe, c urrent doctrine holds that rights closely tied to the family - including the right to marry whoever you choose , the right to sexual autonomy , and the right to guide your own children's upbringing - are among the unenumerated rights protected by the 14th Amendment.\n\nIndeed, when the Supreme Court overruled Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in June, Justice Clarence Thomas argued in a concurring opinion that all of these rights must fall along with the right to an abortion .\n\nBut the Court only started to use substantive due process to advance equality and other progressive values fairly recently. There's also a much darker history underlying doctrines like substantive due process.\n\nNot long after the 14th Amendment was ratified, ex-Confederates, including a disgraced former Supreme Court justice, tried to twist it into a shield protecting white supremacy - and they very nearly succeeded. Several decades later, substantive due process became a tool of plutocrats, and the Court routinely wielded it to strike down pro-labor legislation .\n\nNow, the power to read new constitutional rights into our founding document is held by conservative Republicans like Justice Samuel Alito - the same justice who relied on a centuries-old treatise written by a judge who sentenced two \"witches\" to death in his opinion overruling Roe . It is a terrible mistake to trust this man with that kind of power.\n\nAbandoning substantive due process, moreover, should not mean sacrificing hard-fought victories for reproductive choice or marriage equality. A sounder strategy is to root these rights in constitutional provisions that offer more specific protections. The Constitution's guarantee that no one may be denied \" the equal protection of the laws ,\" for example, is capacious enough to protect both.\n\nIt's time, in other words, to put substantive due process to bed.\n\nThe Constitution is clearly supposed to protect some rights that aren't mentioned within it - this is apparent from the Ninth Amendment , which provides that \"the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n\nBut the Constitution's text also provides few clues about what these unenumerated rights might be. And judges have struggled for more than a century to come up with a coherent theory of which such rights are protected by the Constitution. American judges haven't even settled on a persuasive theory about which provision of the Constitution permits them to find unenumerated rights to be implicit in the document.\n\nOne way to square this circle is to allow judges - and ultimately the Supreme Court - to determine which unenumerated rights should enjoy constitutional protection. That's a fine solution if you are comfortable giving this power to whoever sits on the Court, including the specific justices who currently do.\n\nBut if you are concerned that Alito and his fellow conservative justices do not have your best interests at heart, then it makes more sense to limit the Court's power - and that means that our rights must be grounded in constitutional text that places some limits on judicial discretion.\n\nThe right to reproductive freedom - including the right to abortion - should be found within the Constitution's guarantee that no one shall be denied \" the equal protection of the laws .\"\n\nAs the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote shortly before she joined the Supreme Court, the question of whether women will be able to \"participate as men's full partners in the nation's social, political, and economic life \" hinges upon their \"reproductive autonomy.\" Gender equality, at least at a systemic level, is not possible in a society where women's bodies can be seized by the state for nine months at a time.\n\nRoe , however, said surprisingly little about equality, instead claiming that the right to an abortion is implicit in a right to privacy, which is itself implicit in the due process clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe question of whether to root abortion rights in gender equality or in a broader right to privacy may seem academic, but the stakes are high. The judiciary's power to guarantee equal protection is potent but limited. It merely allows judges to equalize rights, providing to a disadvantaged group what the government has already provided to a more advantaged group. In extreme cases, equal protection may also invalidate policies, like the \"inherently unequal\" segregated schools rejected by Brown v. Board of Education , that systemically relegate a disadvantaged group to an inferior position in society.\n\nSubstantive due process and similar doctrines, by contrast, permit the courts to find any right they choose within the Constitution, including \"rights\" that do serious harm to already disadvantaged groups. As Justice Hugo Black, a liberal Franklin Roosevelt appointee, wrote in 1970, the methods his Court uses to find unenumerated rights within the Constitution are \" an arrogation of unlimited authority by the judiciary .\"\n\nAnd much of the history of substantive due process - and the Supreme Court's use of it - backs Black up.\n\nThe idea that important political rights flow from a provision of the Constitution that only guarantees \"due process\" is quite odd. And it's especially odd because the 14th Amendment also states that \"no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States .\" This language provides a much stronger hook to hang substantive rights upon than the due process clause.\n\nThe story of why this privileges or immunities clause plays almost no role in modern constitutional law, however, is instructive. It is a story about how easily bad actors can manipulate vague constitutional language that guarantees undefined rights.\n\nAnd it starts with John Archibald Campbell , one of the great villains of the Reconstruction Era. A former Supreme Court justice and West Point classmate of Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, Campbell quit the Court at the beginning of the Civil War and eventually become the Confederacy's assistant secretary of war. After the war, he lived in New Orleans, where he complained in an 1871 letter to his daughter that Louisiana's Reconstruction government put \"Africans in place all about us.\"\n\nCampbell read the 14th Amendment and saw an opportunity to neutralize laws enacted by Black legislators. In one case, he argued that a law requiring racially integrated theater seating was unconstitutional because the right to run a segregated business was one of the unnamed \"privileges or immunities\" protected by the new amendment.\n\nThe apotheosis of Campbell's racist litigation strategy, however, was the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which split the justices 5-4 between two wildly divergent theories of unenumerated rights, both of which would remain relevant for decades.\n\nAround the time of the Civil War, New Orleans was the unhealthiest city in the nation. One in 12 residents died every year, often from outbreaks of cholera or yellow fever . One of the most significant contributors to this public health crisis was the city's slaughterhouses, whose waste littered the streets and polluted with rotting offal the Mississippi River that supplied New Orleans's drinking water.\n\nTo deal with this problem, the state's Reconstruction legislature shut down all of New Orleans's slaughterhouses and replaced them with a single grand slaughterhouse that would be open to all butchers - and that would sit downriver of the intake pipes that supplied the city with water.\n\nCampbell objected to this law largely because the legislature that enacted it included 35 Black lawmakers. But he primarily adopted proto-libertarian rhetoric in order to challenge the law in court. Claiming he stood for \" Freedom. Free action, free enterprise [and] free competition ,\" Campbell told the Supreme Court that the Reconstruction legislature's slaughterhouse law must fall.\n\nA majority of the Court saw through Campbell's effort to achieve racist ends by laissez-faire means, and upheld the slaughterhouse law. The purpose of the 14th Amendment, Justice Samuel Miller wrote for the majority , is to ensure \"the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the newly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.\" It wasn't to impose small-government conservatism on the states at the very moment when Black Americans first began to exercise legislative power.\n\nBut while Miller's decision was a victory for public health - and at least a temporary defeat for Campbell's white supremacist project - it achieved this outcome by reading the privileges or immunities clause so narrowly as to render it virtually meaningless.\n\nThough Miller did concede that the 14th Amendment protected some very limited rights, such as the right \"to come to the seat of government to assert any claim he may have upon that government\" or the right to \"use the navigable waters of the United States,\" the thrust of his opinion was that judges should be very reluctant to find rights within the 14th Amendment, lest the courts be transformed into \" a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States .\"\n\nIn effect, Slaughter-House neutralized much of the 14th Amendment. Miller essentially decided it was better to eliminate the possibility that the privileges or immunities clause would be used for good, than to risk allowing someone like Campbell to use it for evil. As Justice Stephen Field complained in dissent, the Court's decision transformed the privileges or immunities clause into \"vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing.\"\n\nField's vision for the 14th Amendment, however, was as inconsistent with its antiracist purpose as Campbell's. If Campbell embraced a kind of proto-libertarianism as a cynical ploy to undermine Black lawmakers, Field did so earnestly and enthusiastically. He believed that the Constitution provides expansive, unenumerated rights to capital. And his vision would eventually prevail during the first third of the 20th century.\n\nField could be the patron saint of modern-day figures like Paul Ryan and Neil Gorsuch , who seek to shrink the government until it can be drowned in a bathtub. After Congress enacted a 2 percent income tax that applied only to the wealthiest one-thousandth of Americans, Field wrote an apocalyptic opinion claiming that \"the present assault upon capital is but the beginning,\" and that it would lead to a \"war of the poor against the rich.\"\n\nHis dissent in Slaughter-House , meanwhile, foreshadowed an age when the Supreme Court would routinely strike down pro-labor legislation on the dubious theory that workers have a right to enter into oppressive labor contracts. Quoting from the economic philosopher Adam Smith, Field wrote that preventing a poor man \"from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper\" is a \"manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman and of those who might be disposed to employ him.\"\n\nThis theory of liberty, and particularly the idea that workers and employers both benefit from a system where workers may enter into oppressive labor contracts, won majority support on the Supreme Court shortly after Field's death in 1899.\n\nThe case that most exemplified this era was Lochner v. New York (1905). Today, Lochner is widely viewed as one of the worst decisions in the Court's history - even Alito denounced it as \"discredited\" in his Dobbs opinion overruling Roe . Lochner struck down a New York law providing that bakery workers, who were typically paid by the day or week and thus gained nothing from longer hours, would work a maximum 10-hour work day and a 60-hour work week.\n\nLochner claimed that the law \"interferes with the right of contract between the employer and employees,\" embracing the laissez-faire approach to labor policy that Field advocated in Slaughter-House.\n\nThe Court eventually abandoned Lochner, and its so-called \"right to contract,\" in 1937. But Lochner was still one of the most consequential decisions of its time. Among other things, the Court relied on Lochner 's so-called \"right to contract\" to strike down laws protecting the right to unionize and laws providing for a minimum wage .\n\nBy the early 20th century, two distinct concepts of unenumerated rights had gained purchase on the Supreme Court. One, which was first articulated by Field and later embraced by a majority of the justices in Lochner , saw the Court as a bulwark against too-aggressive legislatures. Under this theory, the Court had at least some duty to step in when lawmakers enacted policies that offended not only the text of the Constitution, but also the justices' personal sense of how a capitalist society should function.\n\nThe other approach, which resembled Justice Miller's position in Slaughter-House , called for judges to defer to lawmakers' policy decisions. In a now-celebrated dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes articulated this approach: \"A Constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory , whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez faire .\"\n\nOr, as Holmes put it in a more colorful moment, \" if my fellow citizens want to go to hell, I will help them .\" Under this approach, it simply was not the job of judges to find new rights in the Constitution that could thwart the actions of democratically elected lawmakers.\n\nTwo more aspects of the Court's Lochner -era jurisprudence are worth noting. One is that Lochner and its progeny cited the due process clause, not the privileges or immunities clause, as the source of the right to contract. This shift allowed the Court to recognize unenumerated rights without having to explicitly overrule Slaughter-House - even though that meant tying substantive rights to a provision that speaks only of \"process.\"\n\nThe other is that, while Lochner and similarly plutocratic decisions loom large over this era, there was another line of early 20th-century substantive due process cases involving the rights of parents. And these decisions would eventually blossom into cases like Roe v. Wade .\n\nIn 1919, Nebraska forbade school teachers from teaching \" any subject to any person in any language than the English language \" before the student passed the eighth grade. It was a transparently nativist law, enacted, in the words of Nebraska's highest court, because \"the Legislature had seen the baneful effects of permitting foreigners , who had taken residence in this country, to rear and educate their children in the language of their native land.\"\n\nThree years later , Oregon required most parents to send their kids to public and not parochial schools. This law was almost certainly motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment.\n\nThe Court struck both laws down in a pair of substantive due process decisions, Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), both of which emphasized that parents have a right - though not an unlimited one - to direct the upbringing of their children.\n\nAs the Court ruled in Meyer, individuals have a right \"to marry, establish a home and bring up children.\" A parent has a \"natural duty\" to \"give his children education suitable to their station in life.\" And that duty brings with it a right to employ a teacher \"to instruct their children\" in subjects they wish those children to learn.\n\nBeginning in 1937, when a majority of the Supreme Court agreed to scrap Lochner and stop sabotaging much of President Roosevelt's New Deal, the Court began a purge of Lochner- like decisions that thwarted progressive economic regulation. Indeed, the Lochner decision was so offensive to liberals that many left-leaning judges and justices formed an identity around opposing it. As Justice Black said in 1967, the entire reason \"why I came on the Court\" was because \"I was against using due process to force the views of judges on the country .\"\n\nBut Meyer and Pierce, which did not threaten progressive economic programs such as the New Deal, survived this purge - despite Black's belief that any decision reading unenumerated rights into the due process clause was illegitimate. And eventually a majority of the justices decided once again to drink from the forbidden chalice of substantive due process.\n\nJustice William Douglas's opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which built upon Meyer and Pierce to hold that the Constitution permits married couples to use contraception, reads like the work of a sorcerer's apprentice who knows that he is toying with black magic and ineptly tries to hide it.\n\n\"We are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Douglas writes in Griswold , as well as a suggestion that \" Lochner v. State of New York should be our guide.\" But Douglas insisted that his Court would \"decline that invitation.\"\n\nInstead, Griswold relied on the truly risible argument that married couples' right to contraception could be found within the \"penumbras\" and \"emanations\" of various constitutional amendments that \"create zones of privacy.\" This argument, whose only virtue is that it allowed the Court to find an unenumerated right within the Constitution without using the cursed words \"substantive due process,\" is rarely mentioned in the Court's later decisions, except maybe to mock it .\n\nYet, while Griswold fumbled around for a way to protect contraceptive access without adopting the substantive due process framework that animated Lochner , it also shares the Court's revulsion in Meyer and Pierce at the idea that the government would intrude too deeply into intimate decisions that should be made by families. \"Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?\" Douglas asked. \"The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.\"\n\nBy the time Roe was handed down eight years later, the Court was less coy about the fact that it was relying on substantive due process - Roe situated the right to an abortion in \"the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action.\" More significantly, the Roe opinion explicitly placed various decisions protecting the right to decide when and how to form a family under the umbrella of a \"right to privacy.\"\n\nThis right, according to Roe , included \"activities relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.\"\n\nWhen you read the Court's unenumerated rights cases in conjunction (or, at least, the cases that do not rest on the discredited reasoning in Lochner ), a very clear and consistent ideology emerges. Every American has a right to marry a person of their choosing (1967's Loving v. Virginia , 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges ); to form and dissolve intimate bonds with whomever they choose ( Lawrence v. Texas in 2003); to have, or not to have, children at a time of their choosing ( Griswold , 1972's Eisenstadt v. Baird , Roe ); and to raise those children as they desire, subject to laws prohibiting abuse, truancy, and the like ( Meyer , Pierce ).\n\nUnder the pre- Dobbs understanding of substantive due process, there must be firm safeguards against the government interfering too much in these deeply personal decisions. And yet, if you find this vision of family autonomy compelling - and I personally find it quite compelling - I urge you to think for a moment about what the current Court, with its 6-3 Republican supermajority, might do with the power to wall off certain family-centered decisions from government policymakers.\n\nThe question that looms over every single one of the Court's unenumerated rights decisions is whether we can trust an unelected Supreme Court to decide which rights are protected by the Constitution.\n\nImagine what sort of \"rights\" John Archibald Campbell might have found within the 14th Amendment's vague language if he'd remained on the Court rather than committing treason in defense of slavery. Imagine what Stephen Field might have done if he'd had the votes to impose his laissez-faire vision on the country during his lifetime. Imagine, for that matter, what someone like Samuel Alito might do now that he has the power to invent new constitutional \"rights.\"\n\nThink, for example, of the many efforts by social conservatives to remove books they disagree with from public school curriculums and libraries . Or similar efforts to force transgender students to use bathrooms that do not align with their gender identity.\n\nHistorically, cases like Meyer and Pierce have not been understood to allow conservative parents to impose their will on public school curriculums and policies. But someone like Alito could certainly read them that way. If parents have a right to decide their children's' upbringing, what prevents a socially conservative Court from holding that they have a right to send their kids to a public school that doesn't have trans-inclusive bathrooms?\n\nLeading anti-LGBTQ groups have already spent years thinking about how to use substantive due process to achieve their agenda, sometimes even embracing rhetoric lifted straight out of Griswold or Roe .\n\nThe lesson of Lochner is that the power to make \"rights\" can be used in terrible ways. And it can be used to enhance the might of the already-too-powerful.\n\nBut what then of rights, such as marriage equality or the right to sexual autonomy, which current case law finds within the Constitution's due process clause? The short answer is that these rights should be found elsewhere in the Constitution.\n\nThe Court's early substantive due process decisions - including Lochner , Meyer , and Pierce - were the product of a very different era when the text of the Constitution was often treated as an afterthought. As Georgetown law professor Victoria Nourse writes, \"for over fifty years, from 1880 until 1937, American constitutional jurisprudence was neither particularly textual nor particularly focused on original intent .\" Judges routinely decided constitutional cases based on common law principles derived only from other judicial decisions, or from ill-defined concepts such as the \"police power,\" which play a vastly diminished role in modern constitutional law.\n\nMany of the leading lawyers, judges, and legal scholars of that era were quite open about their belief that constitutional law exists separately from the Constitution's text. As Christopher Tiedeman, an enormously influential legal scholar whose work was quoted with approval by hundreds of judicial decisions around the turn of the 20th century, wrote in a 1900 treatise , \"the conservative classes stand in constant fear of the advent of an absolutism more tyrannical and more unreasoning than any before experienced by man - the absolutism of a democratic majority.\"\n\nTo defeat this majority, Tiedeman urged judges to \"lay their interdict upon all legislative acts\" that violate a narrow vision of government power, and do so \" even though these acts do not violate any specific or special provision of the Constitution .\"\n\nOne consequence of this atextualist era in American constitutional law is that judges often relied on vague doctrines like substantive due process to reach outcomes that could have been achieved by relying on a right that is explicitly protected by the Constitution. If a case like Meyer were to arise today, for example, a modern court would undoubtedly find that the right to teach a foreign language is protected by the First Amendment's free speech clause.\n\nIt also helps that, led largely by Justice Black, the Court spent much of the middle of the 20th century holding that states must comply with nearly all of the Bill of Rights , slowly chipping away at an 1833 decision saying that the Bill of Rights applies only to the federal government.\n\nThat means that almost all the rights currently protected by substantive due process can be found elsewhere in the Constitution. The anti-Catholic law struck down in Pierce violated the First Amendment's command that everyone can freely exercise their religion . Laws that deny equal marriage rights to same-sex couples, or that criminalize gay sex, violate the Constitution's command that no one may be denied \" the equal protection of the laws \" (unless, of course, a state is also willing to prohibit opposite-sex marriage and straight sex).\n\nThe right to reproductive autonomy - including the right to abortion - can also be found within this equal protection clause. Recall Justice Ginsburg's argument that the question of whether women will be able to \"participate as men's full partners in the nation's social, political, and economic life \" hinges upon their \"reproductive autonomy.\"\n\nI want to be clear that shifting individual rights jurisprudence away from substantive due process, and toward provisions that explicitly protect more carefully enumerated rights, is not a panacea against partisan or ideological judging. Explicit constitutional rights can be interpreted in ways that undermine democracy and lift up the most powerful - hence the Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) that the Constitution's free speech clause protects the right of corporations to spend unlimited money to influence elections.\n\nBut constitutional provisions like the free speech, free exercise, and equal protection clauses are, at least, bounded. They permit judges to halt government censorship, attacks on religion, and efforts to foster inequality. They don't permit judges to invent literally any right, as substantive due process does. The only real limits on substantive due process are the limits the judiciary imposes on itself.\n\nI also acknowledge that, in arguing that it is time to let the judiciary's unchecked power to recognize unenumerated rights fall by the wayside, I too am making a somewhat atextualist argument. The Ninth Amendment and privileges or immunities clause are still there, tempting judges to read into them whatever they choose.\n\nBut if you disagree with my argument that judges should not use such an extraordinarily vague provision to decide what our rights will be, I want to leave you with a question: How much do you trust Samuel Alito with that power?\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA massive effort to expand access throughout Europe launches today.\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nAn unprecedented effort to expand abortion rights throughout Europe launches today, led by groups that were already fighting for reproductive freedom at the national level in their eight home countries. The My Voice, My Choice campaign aims to collect 1 million signatures in the next few months to pressure leaders of the European Union to commit to helping anyone who is not easily able to end an unwanted pregnancy where they live.\n\nWhile legal abortion is supported throughout Europe and is broadly more accessible and affordable in the EU compared to the United States, there are some exceptions. Poland and Malta have near-total abortion bans, Austria and Germany generally do not provide free abortion care through national health insurance, and in countries such as Croatia and Italy, many doctors refuse to provide the procedure. Activists say their effort could help shore up access for nearly 20 million women .\n\nTheir campaign for a European Citizens' Initiative would help address those gaps by providing financial support for people to get care internationally if needed. Activists are presenting their initiative as voluntary - member states can choose to opt in. Those states that do participate \"in the spirit of solidarity\" could then receive financial support from the EU to terminate pregnancies for those who lack access to safe and legal abortion where they live. The proposed EU mechanism would cover the cost of the procedure but not travel costs.\n\n\"What's really special is it's basically being built as the largest feminist movement in Europe, which is crazy and super tiring sometimes, and also really, really beautiful,\" said Nika Kovač, a Slovenian activist leading the campaign.\n\nKovač told Vox she decided to mobilize on the European-wide level after seeing the Supreme Court overturn legal abortion in the United States. \"The whole idea for this campaign came from the despair in the US,\" she said.\n\nKovač and her colleagues at the 8th of March Institute , a Slovenian human rights group named for International Women's Day, planned this citizens' initiative idea in secret for about 18 months and then started recruiting international partners in late 2023. The core coalition now includes activists from Poland, Ireland, Spain, France, Austria, Croatia, and Finland. They aim to collect 1 million signatures in advance of the European parliamentary elections in June, which occur only once every five years.\n\nCollecting so many signatures in such a short time will be difficult, and if they're successful, it would be the fastest signature collection for a European Citizen Initiative in history. Still, success is not inconceivable given that the effort is being led by organizers with years of mobilization experience in their home countries. Signature collection can be done both in-person and online, and activists are looking to organize at big upcoming events like May Day protests.\n\n\"One thing I can rely on is the stubbornness of these women,\" Kovač said. \"In Europe we are so often caught up in our own national context, and this is the first time I feel like we're slowly coming out of it.\"\n\nThe European Union, which is comprised of 27 member states, has authority to govern via international treaties, primarily in realms such as monetary policy, trade policy, environmental policy, and consumer protection. Any powers - officially known as competences - not covered by these treaties remain exclusive to the member states, and for years activists were told that reproductive rights were simply beyond the scope of what the EU could legislate on, meaning that abortion had to be left to each sovereign country.\n\n\"So many European politicians and bureaucrats say nothing can be done in the context of abortion on the European level because it's not directly one of the competencies of the European Commission,\" Kovač explained. \"So we had to do a lot of thinking and researching.\"\n\nThey convened a group of international lawyers who helped develop a novel legal strategy, positioning their citizens' measure as one within the \" supporting competence \" of the EU, an established official authority that allows the European Commission to support member states for a variety of purposes, including the protection and improvement of human health.\n\nEven with broader grounds for legal exceptions in European countries with earlier gestational age limits, first-trimester bans in Europe still force thousands of pregnant people to travel internationally every year to end their unwanted pregnancies.\n\nOne study published in 2023 looked at pregnant people who traveled from countries like Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, and Italy to the Netherlands or England for later abortion care. Over half of the pregnant people surveyed hadn't learned they were even pregnant until they were at least 14 weeks along, when they had already surpassed the limits in their home countries.\n\nIf activists succeed in collecting enough signatures, then members of the European Commission would need to decide if they would support the citizens' initiative. Activists aim to press all candidates running for European Parliament in June to clarify their stance on the proposal so voters have that information when they go to the polls.\n\n\"It really will depend on what the next European Commission looks like, but the important thing for us is that this will go to them and they will need to speak to it and then do something,\" Kovač said. \"It's really the first concrete solution for the people in Europe.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe case should have a clear outcome, but a Republican Court overcomplicates everything that involves abortion.\n\nKerr v.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe real reason conservative activists might be on the verge of a Supreme Court victory.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nWith newly intense speculation that the Supreme Court will overturn or gut the Roe v. Wade decision, after conservative justices sounded set to do so in Wednesday's arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , a blame game has ensued among supporters of abortion rights.\n\nSome progressives look at the apparent success of the activists on the right and see a record of feckless failure on their own side : If only Democrats cared about abortion rights more and fought for them harder, as the anti-abortion movement fought to roll back abortion, this could have been averted.\n\nBut one of the main reasons conservatives got to the point where Roe 's defeat seems plausible is that they learned to be more like Democrats.\n\nRepublicans won most of the presidential elections in the first two decades after the Roe decision came down, and Republican presidents got to fill every Supreme Court vacancy that opened up in that span. But they did not reliably appoint anti-abortion justices. Several Republican appointees - John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter - ended up voting to uphold Roe , which is why it wasn't overturned decades ago.\n\nIn contrast, though there have been fewer Democratic appointees since Roe , every one of them turned out to be reliably pro-abortion rights.\n\nThe political triumph of conservative activists, then, was in taking over their own party - pressuring George W. Bush and Donald Trump to rethink how Supreme Court appointments were made, and to only appoint nominees they'd vetted and deemed reliably anti-abortion. Groups like the Federalist Society reshaped the party's politics and the conservative legal network so that recent GOP presidents not only could appoint justices believed to have anti-abortion views (due to better vetting) but felt they had to appoint such justices. Again, this was not necessary for Democrats, who had no trouble appointing justices who supported abortion rights.\n\nOnce it became the case that the anti-abortion party apparently only appoints anti-abortion justices, and the party in favor of abortion rights only appoints justices who support those rights, then Roe 's fate came down to which of those parties would win elections at key moments. The GOP did - taking the Senate in 2014 and the presidency in 2016, allowing them to fill three seats between then and 2020, in part because they aggressively used their Senate control to prevent President Obama from filling one of those seats. If Democrats can be said to have \"blown it\" on Roe v. Wade , that's how they did so - by losing those hugely important elections.\n\nIn the first two decades after Roe , spanning 1973 to 1992, six Supreme Court seats newly opened up - all while Republicans who said they opposed Roe v. Wade and would like it overturned were serving as president. (Technically there were seven openings, as William Rehnquist moved from associate justice to chief justice in this time, but he was already on the Court so I'm not counting his promotion as a new appointment.)\n\nSo by the time the Planned Parenthood v. Casey case reached the Supreme Court in 1992, the math did not look good for Roe . Eight of the Supreme Court's nine justices had been appointed by Republican presidents (including Harry Blackmun, who authored Roe in the first place); the sole Democratic appointee was Byron \"Whizzer\" White, who had dissented from Roe .\n\nBut that year, four of those recent Republican appointees - Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter - joined Blackmun, providing a five-vote majority that prevented Roe from being overturned. (The other two new Republican appointees, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, joined Rehnquist and White in dissent.)\n\nThis was a stunning failure from a party that had promised its supporters they'd get Roe overturned. And it happened for several reasons.\n\nOne is that most of these nominees (all but O'Connor and Scalia) had to make it through a Democrat-controlled Senate. President Reagan did try to appoint the conservative, Robert Bork, to one vacancy, but Democrats blocked him, so Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy instead - a fateful switch. Others, like Souter, may have been selected due to their lack of a \"paper trail\" of controversial conservative statements.\n\nAnother reason, though, is that the party just handled judicial appointments differently at that time. Republican presidents weren't so laser-focused on appointing judges who they believed would pass an anti-abortion litmus test. Reagan, for instance, initially prioritized appointing the first woman to the Court, O'Connor, over a nominee who'd be more conservative. And activists who thought about the Court more politically didn't yet have the juice to bend the president to their will every time.\n\nThe final appointment before the Casey decision, George H.W. Bush's appointment of Clarence Thomas, pointed the way to the future in every way except its outcome. Thomas was a staunch conservative (replacing the liberal legend Thurgood Marshall) who would turn out to be reliably anti-abortion, and his nomination was bitterly controversial. But the outcome, in the end, was that the Democrat-controlled Senate did confirm him, 52-48. (From a modern perspective, what's most striking about that vote is that nobody filibustered.)\n\nThen from 1993 to 2012, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama each ended up getting to fill two Supreme Court seats while their own party controlled the Senate.\n\nSo for decades, there was a delicate balance of sorts, with five conservatives and four liberals on the courts, but with some of those conservatives (O'Connor and Kennedy) siding with liberals on certain key issues, and especially on Roe .\n\nThen in 2016, Antonin Scalia died while Barack Obama was president. In theory, this was an enormous opportunity for Obama to replace a conservative with a liberal. The long-sought 5-4 liberal majority was in reach.\n\nExcept for one problem: Republicans had taken over the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections. This was the first Supreme Court vacancy to arise when the Senate and the presidency were controlled by opposite parties since the battle over Thomas's seat in 1991. And partisan polarization had increased in the two and a half decades since.\n\nThough previous Democrat-controlled Senates had rejected some nominees Republican presidents had put up for the Court, each debate was always about each specific nominee. GOP leader Mitch McConnell, though, set a new precedent: He said he wouldn't consider any nominee Obama put up. (He claimed this was because it was an election year, but if Scalia had died in 2015, he would likely have found some other pretext - the appointment was simply too important for conservatives.)\n\nThis move paid off tremendously when Trump won the presidency and the GOP held the Senate in 2016. And Trump's behavior once in office is where the increased success of conservative activists in dominating their party on this issue becomes evident - Trump made clear he'd only put up nominees who had the enthusiastic support of the Federalist Society.\n\nTrump then ended up making three Supreme Court appointments in a single term. Replacing Scalia with Neil Gorsuch kept the conservative majority intact. He then also got to replace Anthony Kennedy and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg - two Roe defenders - with conservatives Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. (He could appoint Barrett because Republicans had managed to hold on to the Senate in the 2018 midterms.)\n\nWe don't yet know for sure how the final decision on Dobbs will come down and what the margin would be. But the overall pattern is clear: Recent Democratic presidents have consistently appointed pro- Roe justices when they could. Republican presidents, though, may have started consistently appointing anti- Roe justices at just the right time.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

      "text": "How the US polarized on abortion - even as most Americans stayed in the middle\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSince Roe was decided in 1973, the US's political parties got further apart on abortion.\n\nby Jillian Weinberger\n\nIn 1976, just a few years after the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in Roe v. Wade , most Americans thought abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances.\n\nThose numbers haven't changed much over almost 50 years. Most Americans still believe abortion should be legal in most circumstances . But our politics have shifted dramatically. And with the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - which effectively overturned Roe - reality has shifted as well. No longer is abortion protected at the federal level.\n\nThe decision comes at a polarized moment: Anti-abortion Democrats and pro-abortion rights Republicans are dwindling breeds. Why? One major reason is a deliberate, decades-long campaign on the right to overturn Roe v. Wade . Conservative attorneys brought cases that undermined Roe with the hope that, by chipping away at the ruling, Supreme Court justices would eventually feel comfortable striking it down.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement has also focused on building a pipeline of judicial nominees through organizations like the Federalist Society. The left, meanwhile, has focused on shifting party opinion on related issues like contraception coverage and the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits government funds from being used to pay for abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or endangering the mother's life, while treating Roe as a largely settled matter.\n\nNow, all those years of work by anti-abortion activists seem to be paying off. Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade , it has tossed out nearly 50 years of jurisprudence along with it.\n\nOver the decades, the ruling turned into one of the biggest lightning rods in American politics, and those years were punctuated by crucial moments.\n\nHere are the most significant.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade is decided. Justice Harry Blackmun writes the opinion, finding that people have a constitutional right to an abortion in the first and second trimester. He grounds that right in the 14th Amendment right to due process and an implied right to privacy.\n\n1976: The Hyde Amendment passes for the first time. The measure prohibits government funds from being spent on abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the pregnant person. The provision exemplifies the kind of restrictions on abortion that the right continued to champion over the next five decades - and eventually draws the focus of the Democratic Party.\n\n1978: James Bopp is named the general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's leading anti-abortion group. He becomes the architect of the strategy that looks set to succeed today: an \"incremental\" approach to slowly undermine Roe until, he hoped, the justices would eventually overturn it. Over the next four decades, Bopp helped states and localities draft abortion restrictions and, when those restrictions were challenged, defended them in the courts. Bopp also wrote the anti-abortion plank for the Republican Party platform in 1980 .\n\n1980: A new alliance between Catholics and evangelicals, driven in part by opposition to abortion, helps Ronald Reagan capture the Republican nomination and, eventually, the presidency. It's the first time abortion becomes a salient national political issue since Roe - and that's in part because evangelical leaders saw it as a more politically palatable issue than their true concerns: maintaining segregation in schools . Still, the alliance, known as the Moral Majority, becomes a political force to be reckoned with for years to come, and elevates the anti-abortion cause and religious right.\n\n1992 : The Supreme Court decides Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, a case concerning state-level abortion restrictions in Pennsylvania. Roe survives, but in this first serious test for abortion rights since it was decided, the Court establishes new limits on the right. In a 5-4 decision, the Court declares that states can pass abortion restrictions as long as they don't pose an \"undue burden\" on the pregnant person and replaces the trimester framework with a \"viability\" of the fetus standard. Following these new standards, the Court upholds most of Pennsylvania's restrictions.\n\n2006: Cecile Richards becomes the president of Planned Parenthood. It's a deliberate move to select a leader suited to build the organization's political power throughout the country and within the Democratic Party. Richards organizes the group's local chapters and capitalizes on political events in 2010 and 2011 so that Planned Parenthood becomes a force in the Democratic Party - so much so that in 2012, the party included a declaration of support for Planned Parenthood in its platform .\n\n2009: Dr. George Tiller, a Kansas abortion provider, is murdered while serving as an usher at his church . It's the most extreme example of the rise in violent acts by anti-abortion activists .\n\n2010: In March, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Because Obama needed the support of even anti-abortion Democrats to pass it, the bill included a compromise on abortion, the Boxer-Nelson Amendment. It allowed states to prohibit plans in the insurance marketplaces from covering abortion. President Obama also signed an executive order declaring that the Hyde Amendment applied to the ACA, and abortion rights activists responded by creating a coalition to defeat the Hyde Amendment.\n\nThat fall, the Republican Party sweeps the midterm elections, due, in part, to backlash to the ACA and the rise of the Tea Party movement. The following year, states pass a record number of abortion restrictions .\n\n2011: The US House passes an amendment by then-Rep. Mike Pence to defund Planned Parenthood. Though the amendment does not pass the Senate, it becomes a polarizing force between the parties.\n\nAbortion rights organizations capitalize on the amendment and the Tea Party's broader effort to defund and restrict abortion rights: Online gifts to Planned Parenthood increase by 500 percent, and NARAL's email activist list grows by 1,000 subscribers per day at the height of the debate around Pence's amendment.\n\n2012 : The DNC pushes an abortion rights message at the national convention.

Democrats support access to affordable family planning services, and President Obama and Democrats will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers.

Democrats support evidence-based and age-appropriate sex education.\n\n2016: Due, in part, to the movement that started after the ACA in 2010, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders call for repealing the Hyde Amendment in their presidential campaigns that spring.

Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Now the matter will be settled on a state-by-state basis, with 22 states likely to quickly ban all or nearly all abortions .\n\nThe road to the 6-3 decision began when the state of Mississippi banned nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state's law violated the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) that pregnant people have a right to terminate their pregnancy up until the point when the fetus is \"viable.\" But Justice Samuel Alito's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturns that standard and Roe .\n\n\"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,\" the decision reads.\n\nThe six Republican appointees voted to upend nearly 50 years of precedent, with the Court's three liberals dissenting. (Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the majority but wrote a concurring opinion saying he would not have overturned Roe outright and preferred \"a more measured\" approach.) As Vox's Anna North explained in 2020 when the newest conservative justice joined the Court, the end of Roe likely won't mean the end of abortion in states that ban it - just legal abortion. And, North wrote, that will have \"devastating consequences for many people, especially low-income Americans and people of color in red states.\"\n\nAlito's opinion is similar to a draft opinion obtained and published by Politico in May - a largely unprecedented leak that rattled the Court and the nation . But even before the leak, the conservative supermajority on the Court had repeatedly signaled they were willing to overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortions .\n\nThis is a breaking news story; Vox's coverage is developing.

Wade , Americans had the right to obtain an abortion if they became pregnant. Then, two years ago, with Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court put an end to it.\n\nThe Biden administration and some blue states - supported by a network of nonprofits focused on reproductive care - aggressively sought to compensate, while many red states enacted near-total bans on abortion.\n\nBut Dobbs has nevertheless had a devastating effect on pregnant people in huge swaths of the country.\n\nWhile the number of abortions across the country actually increased last year - thanks in large part to increasingly cheap and accessible medication abortion - that has not changed the fundamental realities of post- Dobbs America. Large reproductive care deserts have emerged in which there are no abortion providers for hundreds of miles. Pregnant people are being denied necessary medical care as their doctors fear the legal repercussions of providing it. All of this has exacerbated long-standing inequities.\n\nBoth abortion bans and attacks on reproductive rights are broadly unpopular, and elections in the years since Dobbs showed that abortion rights were a potent motivating issue for voters. But in this year's matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump - both of whom have been reluctant messengers of their party's stance on abortion - there's a question as to whether the issue will continue to motivate American voters.\n\nIt is not too late for their votes to make a difference for reproductive access. It may seem like the worst has already come to pass for the abortion rights movement: though once protected by the constitution nationally, access now increasingly depends on where you live or whether you can afford to travel for the care you need. But Republicans have also made clear that they have no intention of stopping there.\n\nIn the wake of Dobbs , 13 states immediately implemented \"trigger\" bans on abortion, while others sought to enforce abortion restrictions that were on the books before Roe v. Wade was even decided in 1973 or quickly moved to pass new bans on abortion. A new patchwork of abortion laws was established in the US within months. A total of 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion .\n\nMany of these bans involved narrow medical exceptions in which abortions could be performed when the health or life of the mother was at risk. But those exceptions have proved exceptionally difficult - in some states, nigh impossible - to qualify for.\n\nKate Cox, a Texas woman, was notably denied an abortion even though her fetus was diagnosed with a rare and terminal genetic condition and forced to travel out of state to obtain one. Other women have been forced to carry to term fetuses doctors know will die shortly upon birth, or been denied abortion care even after experiencing a miscarriage that leaves them in medical distress. The Texas Supreme Court also ruled against a group of 20 women who claimed that they had been denied medically necessary abortions .\n\nRepublicans aren't stopping now that they have overturned Roe . They have continued to advocate for a national abortion ban , even though Trump has indicated that he would not sign it, and opened up new attacks on contraception and in vitro fertilization .\n\nIf Trump wins the election, he could also order the FDA to rescind its approval of the abortion drug mifepristone after the Supreme Court left open that possibility in a recent ruling upholding access to the drug for now.\n\nIn short: The dust has still yet to settle post- Dobbs , but it's clear that abortion was only Republicans' first target in a larger war on reproductive freedom.\n\nDespite the new restrictions on abortion in many parts of the country, the number of abortions performed nationally has actually gone up slightly since Dobbs . But it would be a mistake to see that statistic and say that everyone has improved access to abortion equally across the US.\n\n\"While the numbers have gone up a bit nationally, in some states, there are virtually no abortions happening,\" at least in a formal health care setting, said Usha Ranji, associate director for women's health policy at KFF, a health policy research and news organization.\n\nThe use of medication abortion, which can end a pregnancy during the first trimester, has gone up in particular . Though it was already the most common method of obtaining an abortion pre- Dobbs , it is now cheaper and easier to obtain quickly, especially via telemedicine. That's because, amid the pandemic, the FDA suspended the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person, resulting in an explosion of telemedicine abortion services.\n\nHowever, 19 states have banned telemedicine abortion: Five do so explicitly, and the other 14 require that a prescribing clinician be physically present with the patient. Some states also require counseling or an ultrasound prior to administering an abortion, which can rule out obtaining medication abortion via telemedicine.\n\nThat has caused some patients to turn to community networks or websites that sell abortion pills without interacting with a clinician or pharmacy.\n\nAll of this is a reflection of the monumental effort in states without bans to scale up care, as well as the flood of donations to abortion funds post- Dobbs . New Mexico, for instance, dedicated $10 million to building a new abortion clinic that opened last year on its border with Texas, which has banned abortion with limited exceptions.\n\nBut the question is whether this patchwork solution is sustainable in the long run, especially given that those funds are drying up . And it doesn't entirely mitigate the impact of abortion bans, which have created maternal care deserts across large tracts of the southern US and Midwest.\n\n\"There are still people who are not getting abortions that they would want in part because not everybody can travel,\" Ranji said.\n\nTravel might be difficult for both logistical and financial reasons. And poor women are disproportionately affected: Those women (defined as those who live under 200 percent of the poverty line, which was $46,060 for a family of three in 2022) are concentrated in the 14 states that have banned abortion and the 11 states that have passed strict gestational limits on abortion. Though they may be candidates for medication abortion, they are less likely to know about it as an option - a messaging challenge that abortion activists are struggling to overcome .\n\nThere is also growing evidence that the Dobbs decision has had an adverse effect on maternal health outcomes, including maternal mortality. However, only two years have passed since Dobbs and the number of annual maternal deaths is too small (even if maternal mortality is higher in the US than in any other high-income nation) to determine any trends that have emerged just yet.\n\nSo for now, the best information is based on statistical modeling. Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder projected based on 2020 data on maternal outcomes that, if no abortions were performed nationally, there would be an overall 24 percent increase in maternal deaths after a year. Black mothers would see the biggest increase in mortality.\n\n\"These communities that have historically been harmed will continue to bear the brunt of this abortion care crisis that we're in,\" said Candace Gibson, state policy director at Guttmacher, a nonprofit that researches abortion policy.\n\nAnecdotally, physicians have also reported concerns about their ability to provide adequate reproductive care since the Dobbs decision came down. A KFF national survey of OBGYNs found that significant shares of respondents were concerned about their ability to administer a level of care consistent with the medical profession's standards, their potential legal liability in states where abortion is banned, and health outcomes for their patients. In states where abortion is banned or restricted, for example, six in 10 OBGYNs say their decision-making autonomy has become worse since the Dobbs ruling.\n\n\"They're in this place where they have to really contemplate whether they continue to provide care within that state, or whether they leave the state so that they can actually practice medicine in a way that complies with the standards of care,\" Gibson said.\n\nRepublicans' opposition to abortion rights has proved a thorn in their side electorally ever since Dobbs came down.\n\nIn 2022, Democrats running on abortion rights nearly swept the table . Every ballot initiative aimed at restricting abortion lost , including those in Kansas , Kentucky , and Montana . Meanwhile, ballot initiatives strengthening abortion rights prevailed in states including Michigan , Vermont , and California and even outperformed Democratic candidates in some cases.\n\nIn 2023, Ohio also passed a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in its state constitution. And Democrats were able to flip the Virginia House of Delegates and maintain control of the state senate after Republican Gov. Glen Youngkin committed to a 15-week abortion ban .\n\nAbortion has proved a key motivating issue in these off-cycle years. The question is whether it can continue to be the same force in a presidential election year.\n\nThat may be the case in a handful of states, especially when it comes to the four upcoming ballot measures aimed at expanding abortion rights. In Florida, a six-week abortion ban that recently went into effect could be overridden by a ballot measure seeking to protect abortion until fetal viability, which is estimated around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBut at the top of the ticket, the potential impact of abortion is less clear at a moment when other issues, including the economy and immigration, are dominating the national conversation. Critically, low-propensity voters - those who Biden is struggling with and who could decide this election either because they stay home or lean toward Trump - don't rank abortion rights among the top issues they care about, even though they are broadly pro-abortion rights.\n\nBut turnout in this election is projected to be lower than in 2020 due to voter apathy over a rematch between Biden and Trump. Some commentators argue that low turnout might actually help Democrats , in a turnabout for recent American politics. But abortion could help boost turnout in a way that helps Biden, said Tom Bonier, a Democratic political strategist and the senior adviser to TargetSmart, a data and polling firm.\n\nBut first, he has to overcome a clear messaging problem: 17 percent of voters overall and 12 percent of Democrats blame President Biden for the end of Roe , according to New York Times/Siena College polls and a Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena poll in battleground states. Some less-engaged voters inaccurately associate the overturn with Biden because he was president when the conservative-controlled Supreme Court issued the decision.\n\nBut it also shows that Biden - who as a Catholic has been at times an uncomfortable messenger of his party's pro-abortion rights stance - has room to persuade voters.\n\n\"One of the jobs in front of Democratic campaigns, including the president's campaign, is [to] spend time communicating with these voters and make sure that they understand the reality,\" Bonier said. \"I don't think that most voters are aware of what Republicans are doing, unless they're in the states where it's happening. But I do think those issues will have a substantial impact on the election as that is communicated to more voters.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA judge wrote that Willis had a \"tremendous lapse in judgment,\" but didn't disqualify her from the case.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's prosecution of Donald Trump will be allowed to move forward in Georgia - because her ex has resigned from the prosecution team.\n\nThe background: The high-stakes prosecution of Trump and several of his associates for trying to steal Georgia's 2020 election has been sidetracked in recent months. Defendants had unearthed that Willis and attorney Nathan Wade had a romantic relationship, arguing this was an improper conflict of interest that should get Willis disqualified from the prosecution. A high-profile hearing was held last month in which Willis and Wade testified, denying any impropriety.\n\nWhat's new: Now, a ruling from Judge Scott McAfee Friday morning has rejected the attempt to disqualify Willis. Trump and his allies did not actually prove she had a conflict of interest, McAfee found.\n\nBut McAfee did have some harsh words for Willis, calling her relationship with Wade a \"tremendous lapse in judgment,\" her testimony last month \"unprofessional,\" and opining that \"an odor of mendacity remains\" about the situation. As a result, he said, either Wade or Willis has to leave the team. And, on Friday afternoon, Wade resigned .\n\nWhat's next : Now that Wade has stepped down, the prosecution could get moving again - with the catch that Trump and his co-defendants could appeal and try to get a higher Georgia court to disqualify Willis.\n\nRegardless of the appeal, this was always the least likely of the four Trump prosecutions to go to trial before the election, due to its complexity. And though there is no trial date just yet, the recent drama has made it even more likely to slip into 2025.\n\nAll the wrangling around this topic really boiled down to two factual disputes.\n\n1) Timing: Did Willis and Wade start dating only after she hired him for the Trump case (as they claimed under oath), or was it before (which would mean she hired her romantic partner)?\n\nOne witness, a former friend and employee of Willis's, had testified that the relationship predated Wade's hiring, but she offered no specifics to back up that claim. Another witness, Wade's former attorney, had claimed in gossipy text messages to a defendant's attorney that they were already dating when Willis hired Wade, but he would not repeat this under oath. Trump's attorneys also put forward cellphone data which they said showed Wade was often near Willis's house at night before he joined the case.\n\nJudge McAfee concluded that none of this amounted to proof Wade and Willis were lying. But, he said, there were \"reasonable questions\" about whether the two \"testified untruthfully about the timing of their relationship.\"\n\n2) Money: In trying to establish a conflict of interest, defendants presented documents showing Wade had paid for various trips that he and Willis took together. This showed, they claimed, that Willis improperly financially benefited from the prosecution - that she hired Wade, steered taxpayer money to him, and then lived large on his dime.\n\nAt the hearing, Willis testified that she and Wade roughly split expenses, and that when he paid for trips, she later reimbursed him. Asked why there were few financial records showing she reimbursed him, Willis said that she typically did so by giving him cash, saying she regularly kept large amounts of cash at her home.\n\nThough Trump's defenders scoffed at this claim, Judge McAfee ruled that it was \"not so incredible as to be inherently unbelievable.\" More importantly, the judge wrote, any financial gain from Wade does not seem to have been \"a motivating factor on the part of the District Attorney to indict and prosecute this case.\"\n\nThe judge's conclusion: So regarding both the relationship's timing and improper financial benefit, McAfee concluded that the accusations against Willis hadn't been proven. However, his ruling continued, the standard isn't just about what can be proven, it's also about \"the appearance of impropriety.\"\n\n\"A reasonable observer unburdened by partisan blinders,\" McAfee wrote, \"should believe the law was impartially applied.\" Any \"distractions\" that \"detract\" from that goal, he wrote, \"should be proportionally addressed.\" Therefore, he said, either Willis or Wade had to go - and now Wade has.\n\nUpdate, March 15, 3:30 pm ET: This story, originally published March 15, has been updated with news of Wade's resignation.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

He went in for the surgery on Dec. 18, 2023, and found out that the tumor was indeed cancerous.\n\nHe had 40% of his right kidney removed in the surgery - and he said on the podcast that it was a challenge for him in many ways.\n\n\"My own journey to have that surgery, I think it was the first time my family - my dad, my kids - they saw me weak,\" Wade said. \"That moment was probably the weakest one I've ever felt in my life.\"\n\nBut he said he has been making a point of living differently and to the fullest ever since. Wade also emphasized the need for men in particular to check in and take time out for themselves with regard to health.\n\nWade is a native of Chicago's South Side. His childhood home was at 59th Street and Prairie Avenue in the Washington Park neighborhood. He and his family later lived in south suburban Robbins.\n\nWade put Harold L.

      "text": "Former Miami Heat great Dwyane Wade launches online community supporting transgender youth\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  May 23, 2024 / 1:21 PM EDT / AP\n\nMIAMI - NBA Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade was back in South Florida on Thursday to do battle again.\n\nHe spent more than 14 seasons as a guard for the Miami Heat, winning three championships, having Miami-Dade County nicknamed \"Wade County,\" and he still leads the franchise in everything from points and rebounds to personal fouls. But the fight he outlined Thursday at The Elevate Prize Foundation's Make Good Famous Summit, after receiving the nonprofit's Elevate Prize Catalyst Award, may be the most personal of all.\n\n\"We've done so many great things here so it wasn't easy to leave,\" Wade told The Associated Press in an interview before the award ceremony. \"But the community wasn't here for Zaya, so the community wasn't here for us.\"\n\nWade's daughter, Zaya, who turns 17 next week, came out as transgender in 2020 in the midst of anti-trans legislation in Florida and other states that prompted many trans adults to flee the state. The Wade family sold their Florida home last year and moved to California.\n\nIn accepting the award, Wade shared it with Zaya and credited her with inspiring the creation of Translatable , a new online community designed to support transgender children and their families.\n\n\"The question was presented to her as, 'If you have one thing that you want to see change in this community, what would it be?',\" Wade recalled. \"And, for her, it goes right to parents. It goes right to the adults. It goes right to us. It's not the kids. It's us. And so she wanted to create a space that felt safe for parents and their kids. That's what Translatable is, and it's her baby.\"\n\nWade hopes Translatable, which is funded by the Wade Family Foundation, will provide a community to \"support growth, mental health, and well-being, and that this space ignites more conversations leading to greater understanding and acceptance.\" He said he will use the $250,000 in unrestricted funding that comes with The Elevate Prize Catalyst Award for Translatable.\n\nElevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said that after hearing Wade's plans, her nonprofit made a separate additional donation to Translatable, which was built with support from the Human Rights Campaign and The Trevor Project.\n\n\"Dwyane Wade and what he represents speaks to the ethos of the whole foundation,\" Jayaram told the AP. \"He is such a hero in the sports universe and even beyond basketball. He's been in the social justice space almost since the very beginning of his NBA career and most people don't know that.\"\n\nJayaram said that Wade felt empowered when Zaya came out as transgender in 2020 and it was \"so deeply inspirational to us that we were just dying to be a part of what he's building.\"\n\nThe Elevate Prize Catalyst Award helps its winners, who have included actors Matt Damon and Michael J. Fox and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai, to amplify their philanthropic work by using the foundation's resources and connections to inspire more donors and supporters.\n\nWade said his support of trans rights is a natural extension of being a parent and talked about how much he enjoys learning from Zaya in hourslong discussions at home. Jayaram said she was struck by Wade's devotion as a parent, but also commended his decision to launch Translatable in Florida, \"a place where many might feel a sense of exclusion.\"\n\n\"We understand that in this state that not everyone thinks the way some others think,\" Wade said. \"Like most things in life, once you get to know them, you have more ability to be understanding. And so if you don't want to know them, then you stay ignorant in a sense.\"\n\nComedian and \"Everything's Trash\" actress Phoebe Robinson, who interviewed Wade as part of the summit, said that she admired Wade for being outspoken on numerous issues.\n\n\"In a time when people are so worried about saying anything because they are only thinking about their bottom line, I think the fact that he's thinking about humanity first is amazing, really stressing the importance of connection and community to help protect people and help them grow and just blossom,\" Robinson said.\n\nAlexander Roque, executive director of the Ali Forney Center, which helps homeless LGBTQ+ youth, said Translatable comes at a critical time for transgender youth, with more than 500 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced this year.\n\n\"Not all bills turn into law, but they're all acts of hate that affect our kids in very devastating ways,\" he said. \"We know statistically that every time there's an anti-LGBTQ bill in the media, there's a 400% increase in calls to suicide hotlines by young people. We also know that we're seeing a significant increase in unhoused LGBTQ youth because of family rejection. So to have someone of this celebrity so invested in the community, it's helping to change the tide of what's happening to our kids and perhaps one of the most hopeful moments in what I hope is a changing tide.\"\n\nDr. Michelle Forcier, a clinician at FOLX Health, which provides health services for LGBTQIA+ people nationally, said creating an online community for trans youth is a specific program that would be helpful.\n\n\"Youth are all about electronic and online communication, socialization, and communities,\" she said. \"So if you are trying to support youth it only makes sense to be a part of how youth feel most comfortable communicating.\"\n\nThat this community comes from a celebrity ally makes it more impactful, Forcier said.\n\n\"The transgender and gender-diverse community does not have the deep pockets - including financial, political, and media resources - that the anti-transgender and anti-diversity political and advocacy community has,\" she said. \"To have a champion who shows up for some of our most vulnerable - transgender and gender-diverse youth and the families that care for them - that would be a truly heroic act and possibly change the game entirely.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

And so that's one of the reasons why I don't live there,\" he told Nichols.\n\nIn recent months, Florida has passed legislation that targets the LGBTQ+ community in various ways, including a law banning people from using a bathroom other than their sex assigned at birth, a law preventing children from watching drag shows, and a law banning classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades.\n\nWade, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame earlier this month, sold his Miami beachside residence in 2021 and now lives in Los Angeles County with his family.

The 66-year-old made the announcement on social media on Saturday, posting a message of positivity in the face of his diagnosis.\n\n\"I've never been a goal oriented person but with the strength and support of my family and my faith in God I'm going to ring that damn bell,\" Boggs posted to his X account on Saturday.\n\nI've never been a goal oriented person but with the strength and support of my family and my faith in God I'm going to ring that damn bell 💪🏻🙏 #positiveattitude pic.twitter.com/Ida9Y9mXbc\n\nBoggs played 11 of his 18 MLB seasons with the Red Sox, and was consistently one of the best hitters in baseball during his time in Boston. A seventh-round pick by the Red Sox in 1976, he debuted in 1982 and hit .349 over 104 games to finish third in Rookie of the Year voting. That was just a preview of what was to come from Boggs.\n\nBoggs won his first of five batting titles with the Red Sox in 1984 when he hit .361. His highest season average came in 1985 when he hit .368 and collected a career-best 240 hits. Boggs hit .338 for his Boston career, which is second only to Ted Williams and his .344 career average in a Red Sox franchise history. He went seven straight seasons with at least 200 hits from 1983-89.\n\nBoggs was a fan favorite for his work with his bat, solid play at third base, and his superstitions on the field. He earned the nickname \"Chicken Man\" because he ate chicken before every game.\n\nA 12-time MLB All-Star, Boggs also played with the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays. He signed with the Yankees in 1993 and went on to win a pair of Gold Gloves in pinstripes, plus a World Series with New York in 1996.\n\nBoggs finished his playing career with 3,010 hits to go with his .328 average. He was enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005, wearing a Red Sox hat on his plaque. The Red Sox retired Boggs' No. 26 jersey in 2016.\n\nMatthew Geagan is a sports producer for CBS Boston.

The next time it's gotta be forever,\" Wade said, according to HuffPost.\n\nUnion and Wade temporarily went their separate ways in early 2013.\n\nLater, Union told Glamour they split \"because of distance and scheduling.\"\n\n\"I finished filming [\"Being Mary Jane\"], then I flew to Vegas right away to start shooting \"Think Like a Man Too,\" she told Glamour. \"I couldn't take time off, and I missed some quality togetherness we desperately needed.\"\n\nDuring this split, Wade fathered a child with another woman .\n\n\"It should go without saying that we were not in a good place at the time that child was conceived,\" Union wrote in a 2021 essay for Time . \"But we were doing much better when he finally told me about the pregnancy. To say I was devastated is to pick a word on a low shelf for convenience.\"\n\nA few months later in April, the couple was spotted together at a Miami Heat event .\n\nWade proposed to Union, who happily announced the couple's engagement on Instagram . The ring reportedly cost $1 million .\n\n\"Sooooo this happened... #Yessss,\" she commented with a string of dancing emojis, clapping emojis and heart-eyed emojis.\n\nThe celebrity couple tied the knot on August 30, 2014 . Some family members were included in the wedding party, per shared photos .\n\nAfter the wedding, they embarked on a honeymoon in the Maldives .\n\nUnion shared a sweet wedding moment on Instagram .\n\n\"Waking up every morning next to my best friend is a blessing I could've never imagined,\" she wrote.\n\nAccording to Union's tweet, their baby girl arrived via surrogate on November 7.\n\nThe book, \"Shady Baby,\" is inspired by their daughter .\n\n\"This is our first children's book we did together and we're so excited for the world to read Shady Baby ,\" the pair told People in an exclusive joint statement at the time. \"Inspired by our daughter, Kaavia James, we wanted to create a children's book that not only had a little Black girl as the main character but that also reflects the global community we live in.\"\n\nOn November 11, Union shared a video of herself reacting to Wade's new tattoo , which he surprised her with for her 50th birthday during a family vacation to Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nWade's tattoo is on his wrist and shows a heart outline next to her initials \"GU.\"\n\n\"The moment you find out your man has made you his 17th tattoo. @dframeddanewade made his best bday surprise for #SouthAfrica WadeWorldTour2022 edition #Capetown Part 4,\" Union wrote in the post's caption , which was sprinkled with heart emojis.\n\nAt the event, the couple was presented with the President's Award to honor their philanthropic work and support of the LGBTQ community.\n\nNAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson told Variety that the couple was chosen for how they supported their daughter Zaya Wade , who came out as transgender in 2020.\n\nDuring the speech, Union called for support of Black trans people.\n\n\"This is a conversation worth having in ways that can actually build bridges. That don't fan the flames of hatred or division,\" she said during the speech, per Variety. \"That don't enable lawmakers or justice systems to look the other way when Black trans people are under attack. That don't drive more young people to hate themselves or harm themselves. That don't cost people their lives.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's top prosecutor in Georgia admits dating DA Fani Willis, but says they always went halfsies on travel\n\nFani Willis, the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney prosecuting former President Donald Trump and 18 of his allies over 2020 election interference, admitted to having a relationship with the man she appointed to special prosecutor in the case.\n\nIn a new court filing on Friday, attorneys for Willis hit back at demands to disqualify her over allegations that she had an \"improper\" romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nThe highly-anticipated court filing was in response to a January 8 motion that was filed by a lawyer for one of the co-defendants in the racketeering case , former Trump campaign staffer Michael Roman.\n\nThat motion alleged that the relationship began while Wade - who filed for divorce from Joycelyn Wade on November 2, 2021 - was married. The divorce filing came a day after Willis appointed Wade to spearhead the probe into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Trump's Georgia loss during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn Willis' response to the motion on Friday, her attorney argued that the efforts to disqualify her have \"no merit\" and \"should be summarily denied without an evidentiary hearing.\"\n\n\"While the allegations raised in the various motions are salacious and garnered the media attention they were designed to obtain, none provide this Court with any basis upon which to order the relief they seek,\" the filing from Willis' attorneys says.\n\nWillis' lawyers wrote that she never benefited financially from a relationship with Nathan Wade and that she has no financial or personal conflict of interest that justifies disqualification.\n\n\"To be absolutely clear, the personal relationship between Special Prosecutor Wade and District Attorney Willis has never involved direct or indirect financial benefit to District Attorney Willis,\" the filing read.\n\nWillis' attorneys also pointed to \"at least two personal relationships\" between lawyers for defendants in the election interference case \"that, under the standard urged by the Roman's motion, would almost certainly require disqualification.\"\n\nAn affidavit from Wade was included in the Friday filing in which he admitted to having a relationship with Willis.\n\n\"While professional associates and friends since 2019, there was no personal relationship between District Attorney Willis and me prior to or at the time of my appointment as special prosecutor in 2021,\" Nathan Wade said, according to the filing.\n\n\"In 2022, District Attorney Willis and I developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship,\" said Nathan Wade, according to the court documents.\n\nRoman's lawyer accused Willis of benefiting financially from hiring Wade because he paid for her extravagant vacations, but Wade said they share all travel costs.\n\n\"The District Attorney and I are both financially independent professionals; expenses for personal travel were roughly divided equally between us,\" he wrote. \"At times I have made and purchased travel for District Attorney Willis and myself from my personal funds.\"\n\nRoman's motion suggested that Willis benefited from the hundreds of thousands of dollars Nathan Wade was paid for his work on the case because he went on to pay for their travel to places like Napa Valley, Florida, and the Caribbean. The motion also claimed that Nathan Wade also bought tickets for him and Willis to go on cruises.\n\n\"As the layers unfold, it becomes clear that the district attorney and the special prosecutor have been profiting personally from this prosecution at Fulton County's expense,\" Roman's motion, which does not provide any proof, said.\n\nThe motion calls \"the entire prosecution\" \"invalid and unconstitutional\" and seeks to get the criminal indictment against Roman tossed and to disqualify Willis, an elected Democrat, her office, and Nathan Wade from prosecuting the case.\n\nAttorneys for Trump, along with his co-defendant, lawyer Robert Cheeley, have also joined in on the motion filed by Merchant, Roman's lawyer.\n\nTrump, who was quick to weigh in on the allegations of an interoffice affair, posted to Truth Social Friday about Willis' response.\n\n\"Fani Willis, the D.A. of Fulton County, just admitted to having a sexual relationship with the Prosecutor she, in consultation with the White House and DOJ, appointed to 'GET PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP,'\" he wrote.\n\n\"By going after the most high level person, and the Republican Nominee, she was able to get her \"lover\" much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual. THAT MEANS THAT THIS SCAM IS TOTALLY DISCREDITED & OVER!\"\n\nMeanwhile, legal expert and former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Business Insider the relationship is a \"terrible look and a potential ethics violation\" for Willis.\n\n\"But it's not a conflict of interest with respect to Trump or the co-defendants,\" Rahmani, the president and co-founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Business Insider.\n\nRahmani said that Willis and Nathan Wade \"should probably step down from the case due to the optics and have career prosecutors take over, but there is no legal requirement that they do so or effect if they do not.\"\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a February 15 hearing on Roman's motion.\n\nMerchant has subpoenaed Willis and Nathan Wade to testify at that hearing.\n\nLater last month, lawyers for Joycelyn Wade had subpoenaed Willis for a deposition in the divorce proceedings. In a court filing, an attorney for Willis argued that Joycelyn Wade was \"using the legal process to harass and embarrass\" Willis and was, in turn, \"obstructing and interfering\" with the election interference case.\n\nJoycelyn Wade's lawyers, in a filing in response, included credit card statements that showed Wade bought plane tickets in October 2022 for him and Willis to go to Miami and booked tickets in their names for San Francisco.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nathan and Joycelyn Wade reached a temporary divorce settlement, which canceled a Wednesday hearing at which Nathan Wade was expected to be grilled about his relationship with Willis, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Fani Willis' workplace romance - and just how inappropriate it is - takes center stage in Trump's Georgia criminal case\n\nGeorgia attorney Nathan Wade - a legal mind also known locally for his ascots and personal style - was a married, but separated man in 2021 when Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plucked him from his private practice to lead the state's prosecution of Donald Trump and his 18 allies on charges of election fraud.\n\nWade was a longtime professional acquaintance to Willis, the first woman to hold the office of DA in Fulton County, and had worked for decades in suburban Atlanta as a lawyer and judge handling mostly low-level criminal cases.\n\nSince being hired as a special prosecutor by Willis, though, Wade has made at least $653,880 from the District Attorney's office for his work overseeing one of the most high-profile criminal corruption trials in US history - and in both of their careers.\n\nBut these historic and damning allegations against the former US president and his remaining codefendants have been, at least temporarily, upstaged by salacious accusations that Willis and Wade had been entangled in an illicit extramarital affair that somehow compromises the case.\n\nWade had filed for divorce from his wife on Nov. 2, 2021, one day after he was hired by Willis.\n\nLawyers for Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign advisor and codefendant, filed a motion in Fulton County Superior Court citing Wade's divorce filings.\n\nIn it, they allege that Willis benefited financially from hiring Wade because he paid for her luxe travel to tropical destinations - including Aruba and Belize - and it warrants a conflict of interest so great that Willis and her office should be removed from the case, or for the indictment to be dismissed in entirety.\n\nThese accusations have taken center stage in Trump's criminal prosecution, with Roman's team issuing subpoenas to Wade, Willis, and half a dozen witnesses who have worked with them.\n\nAt a hearing on Monday in preparation for the blockbuster testimony later this week, a prosecutor told Judge Scott McAfee that Willis' own father, also a lawyer, will be called to testify in her defense.\n\nHer father, John C. Floyd III, is expected to say that he had lived with his daughter at the time Roman's attorneys have said she \"cohabitated\" with Wade.\n\nThe center of Thursday's hearing will be whether either prosecutor has a conflict of interest in the case.\n\nRoman's attorneys must prove that Willis acquired a personal interest or stake in the defendant's conviction - and that it is \"actual conflict\" and not simply speculative.\n\nWillis' lawyers responded earlier this to the allegations denying that she ever benefited financially from a relationship with Wade. Her lawyers have written that no financial or personal conflict of interest justifies disqualification - and pointed to two ongoing relationships between defense attorneys in the case.\n\nIn his affidavit, Wade denied that he and Willis were in a relationship at the time he was appointed a special prosecutor, noting that they had been professional acquaintances when he was hired, and that became more personal while working together on the case.\n\n\"In 2022, District Attorney Willis and I developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship,\" Wade said earlier this month, stopping short of calling their relationship romantic and insisting it began after he split with his ex-wife.\n\nAs for any alleged travel, he said, they mostly split the expenses.\n\nWillis' office and Wade did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Willis and Wade asked McAfee to keep them both off the witness stand on Thursday.\n\nMcAfee said Monday that he wasn't going to quash the subpoenas immediately, but that he would first like to hear testimony from Terrence Bradley, a lawyer who represented Wade in his divorce.\n\nRoman's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, will be allowed to question Bradley about Wade and Willis' relationship, whether the relationship was \"romantic or non-romantic in nature,\" when it began, and whether it's ongoing, McAfee said Tuesday.\n\nWade has already avoided having to discuss the relationship under oath once - that time in his divorce case - when he settled with his ex-wife a day before he was expected to testify.\n\nThis time, though, it may be unavoidable.\n\nLegal experts have largely agreed that it will be a long shot for Roman's attorneys to prove that the alleged romantic relationship establishes a true conflict of interest in the criminal case, but that it will be embarrassing to both of them - and could even be a potential ethics violation for Willis.\n\nIn an amicus brief filed in the case, a group of 17 attorneys and ethics experts wrote that they have no knowledge of whether there was a romantic relationship between Wade and Willis, but even if there was, it does not warrant her disqualification or a dismissal.\n\n\"But even if all Defendants' allegations are true, they do not mandate disqualification here. Indeed, they do not even come close,\" the group wrote.\n\nThe experts wrote in their brief that the cost of doing so is unfair to residents of Georgia.\n\nMcAfee said Monday that it is possible Willis could be removed from the case.\n\nDoing so would almost certainly cause more delays to Trump's Georgia prosecution.\n\nMany are left wondering why - in a case so extraordinary and consequential - either the District Attorney or Wade would risk even the appearance of impropriety.\n\nNatalie Musumeci contributed to this report.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Fani Willis' workplace romance - and just how inappropriate it is - takes center stage in Trump's Georgia criminal case\n\nGeorgia attorney Nathan Wade - a legal mind also known locally for his ascots and personal style - was a married, but separated man in 2021 when Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plucked him from his private practice to lead the state's prosecution of Donald Trump and his 18 allies on charges of election fraud.\n\nWade was a longtime professional acquaintance to Willis, the first woman to hold the office of DA in Fulton County, and had worked for decades in suburban Atlanta as a lawyer and judge handling mostly low-level criminal cases.\n\nSince being hired as a special prosecutor by Willis, though, Wade has made at least $653,880 from the District Attorney's office for his work overseeing one of the most high-profile criminal corruption trials in US history - and in both of their careers.\n\nBut these historic and damning allegations against the former US president and his remaining codefendants have been, at least temporarily, upstaged by salacious accusations that Willis and Wade had been entangled in an illicit extramarital affair that somehow compromises the case.\n\nWade had filed for divorce from his wife on Nov. 2, 2021, one day after he was hired by Willis.\n\nLawyers for Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign advisor and codefendant, filed a motion in Fulton County Superior Court citing Wade's divorce filings.\n\nIn it, they allege that Willis benefited financially from hiring Wade because he paid for her luxe travel to tropical destinations - including Aruba and Belize - and it warrants a conflict of interest so great that Willis and her office should be removed from the case, or for the indictment to be dismissed in entirety.\n\nThese accusations have taken center stage in Trump's criminal prosecution, with Roman's team issuing subpoenas to Wade, Willis, and half a dozen witnesses who have worked with them.\n\nAt a hearing on Monday in preparation for the blockbuster testimony later this week, a prosecutor told Judge Scott McAfee that Willis' own father, also a lawyer, will be called to testify in her defense.\n\nHer father, John C. Floyd III, is expected to say that he had lived with his daughter at the time Roman's attorneys have said she \"cohabitated\" with Wade.\n\nThe center of Thursday's hearing will be whether either prosecutor has a conflict of interest in the case.\n\nRoman's attorneys must prove that Willis acquired a personal interest or stake in the defendant's conviction - and that it is \"actual conflict\" and not simply speculative.\n\nWillis' lawyers responded earlier this to the allegations denying that she ever benefited financially from a relationship with Wade. Her lawyers have written that no financial or personal conflict of interest justifies disqualification - and pointed to two ongoing relationships between defense attorneys in the case.\n\nIn his affidavit, Wade denied that he and Willis were in a relationship at the time he was appointed a special prosecutor, noting that they had been professional acquaintances when he was hired, and that became more personal while working together on the case.\n\n\"In 2022, District Attorney Willis and I developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship,\" Wade said earlier this month, stopping short of calling their relationship romantic and insisting it began after he split with his ex-wife.\n\nAs for any alleged travel, he said, they mostly split the expenses.\n\nWillis' office and Wade did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Willis and Wade asked McAfee to keep them both off the witness stand on Thursday.\n\nMcAfee said Monday that he wasn't going to quash the subpoenas immediately, but that he would first like to hear testimony from Terrence Bradley, a lawyer who represented Wade in his divorce.\n\nRoman's attorney, Ashleigh Merchant, will be allowed to question Bradley about Wade and Willis' relationship, whether the relationship was \"romantic or non-romantic in nature,\" when it began, and whether it's ongoing, McAfee said Tuesday.\n\nWade has already avoided having to discuss the relationship under oath once - that time in his divorce case - when he settled with his ex-wife a day before he was expected to testify.\n\nThis time, though, it may be unavoidable.\n\nLegal experts have largely agreed that it will be a long shot for Roman's attorneys to prove that the alleged romantic relationship establishes a true conflict of interest in the criminal case, but that it will be embarrassing to both of them - and could even be a potential ethics violation for Willis.\n\nIn an amicus brief filed in the case, a group of 17 attorneys and ethics experts wrote that they have no knowledge of whether there was a romantic relationship between Wade and Willis, but even if there was, it does not warrant her disqualification or a dismissal.\n\n\"But even if all Defendants' allegations are true, they do not mandate disqualification here. Indeed, they do not even come close,\" the group wrote.\n\nThe experts wrote in their brief that the cost of doing so is unfair to residents of Georgia.\n\nMcAfee said Monday that it is possible Willis could be removed from the case.\n\nDoing so would almost certainly cause more delays to Trump's Georgia prosecution.\n\nMany are left wondering why - in a case so extraordinary and consequential - either the District Attorney or Wade would risk even the appearance of impropriety.\n\nNatalie Musumeci contributed to this report.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, ending right to abortion upheld for decades\n\nBy\n\nNina Totenberg\n\n,\n\nSarah McCammon\n\nAnti-abortion activists rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on June 6. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nAnti-abortion activists rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on June 6.\n\nIn a historic and far-reaching decision, the U.S. Supreme Court officially reversed Roe v. Wade on Friday, declaring that the constitutional right to abortion, upheld for nearly a half century , no longer exists.\n\nWriting for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1973 Roe ruling and repeated subsequent high court decisions reaffirming Roe \"must be overruled\" because they were \"egregiously wrong,\" the arguments \"exceptionally weak\" and so \"damaging\" that they amounted to \"an abuse of judicial authority.\"\n\nThe decision, most of which was leaked in early May, means that abortion rights will be rolled back in nearly half of the states immediately, with more restrictions likely to follow. For all practical purposes, abortion will not be available in large swaths of the country. The decision may well mean too that the court itself, as well as the abortion question, will become a focal point in the upcoming fall elections and in the fall and thereafter.\n\nJoining the Alito opinion were Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by the first President Bush, and the three Trump appointees - Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, concurred in the judgment only, and would have limited the decision to upholding the Mississippi law at issue in the case, which banned abortions after 15 weeks. Calling the decision \"a serious jolt to the legal system,\" he said that both the majority and dissent displayed \"a relentless freedom from doubt  on the legal issue that I cannot share.\"\n\nDissenting were Justices Stephen Breyer, appointed by President Clinton, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appointed by President Obama. The said that the court decision means that \"young women today will come of age with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.\" Indeed, they said the court's opinion means that   \"from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\"\n\n\"With sorrow - for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection - we dissent,\" they wrote.\n\nAlito's  78-page opinion, which has a 30-page appendix, seemingly leaves no authority uncited as support for the proposition that there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in various provisions of the Constitution - and similarly, no evidence that peoples' reliance on the court's abortion precedents over the past half century should matter.\n\nAlito pointed for instance, to Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the 1992 decision that upheld the central holding of Roe and was written by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter, all Republican appointees to the court. Alito pointed to language in the Casey opinion that he said \"conceded\" reliance interests were not really implicated because contraception could prevent almost all unplanned pregnancies.\n\nIn fact, though, that 1992 opinion went on to dismiss that very argument as \"unrealistic,\" because it \"refuse[s] to face the fact\" that for decades \"people have organized intimate relationships and made choices ... in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.\" Not exactly the concession that Alito described.\n\nIt is not unusual for justices to cherry pick quotes but not so out of context and not from former colleagues who are still alive and privately, not amused at all.\n\nIn the end, though, Alito's opinion has a larger objective, perhaps multiple objectives.\n\nWriting for the majority, he said forthrightly that abortion is a matter to be decided by states and the voters in the states. \"We hold,\" he wrote, that \"the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.\" As to what standard the courts should apply in the event that a state regulation is challenged, Alito said any state regulation of abortion is presumptively valid and \"must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought\" it was serving \"legitimate state interests,\" including \"respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development.\" In addition, he noted, states are entitled to regulate abortion to eliminate \"gruesome and barbaric\" medical procedures; to \"preserve the integrity of the medical profession\"; and to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability, including barring abortion in cases of fetal abnormality.\n\nUltimately, the translation of all that is that states appear to be completely free to ban abortions for any reason.\n\nNear the end of Friday's  decision, Alito sought to allay fears about the wide-ranging nature of his opinion. \"To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. \"\n\nBut in his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas said the legal rationale for Friday's decision could be applied to overturn other major cases, including those that legalized gay marriage, barred the criminalization of consensual homosexual conduct, and protected the rights of married people to have access to contraception.\n\n\"For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all\" of those precedents.  because they are \"demonstrably erroneous.'\"\n\nThe court's liberals noted that Thomas's language cast doubt on Alito's assurances at the end of his opinion, that this opinion was really only about abortion.\n\n\"The first problem with the majority's account comes from Justice Thomas's concurrence-which makes clear he is not with the program,\" they wrote. \"In saying that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, Justice Thomas explains, he means only that they are not at issue in this very case.\"\n\nThe next steps on abortion across the country will play out in a variety of ways, almost all of them resulting in abortion bans.\n\nSeveral states - among them Mississippi, North Carolina, and Wisconsin - still have decades-old abortion bans on their books; with Roe overturned, those states could revert to a pre- Roe environment. Officials in such states could seek to enforce old laws, or ask the courts to reinstate them. For example, a Michigan law dating back to 1931 would make abortion a felony. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has been working to try to block that law.\n\nAnother path to banning abortion involves \"trigger bans,\" newer laws pushed through by anti-abortion rights legislators in many states in anticipation of the Supreme Court's action. Some 15 states - in the South, West and Midwest - have such laws in place, according to CRR and Guttmacher, but they fall into different categories.\n\nSome states will act quickly to ban abortion. According to a new analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, South Dakota, Kentucky and Louisiana have laws in place that lawmakers designed explicitly to take effect immediately upon the fall of the Roe precedent. Idaho, Tennessee, and Texas - where most abortions are already illegal after about six weeks of pregnancy - have similar laws, which would take effect after 30 days. Guttmacher says seven other \"trigger ban\" states have laws that would require state officials such as governors or attorneys general to take action to implement them.\n\nSue Liebel, state policy director with the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said she expects officials in many of those Republican-controlled states to take swift action to do so.\n\n\"We have been talking to all of those about acting immediately,\" Liebel told NPR . \"So when that happens, let's be ready. How do you get that back into play?\"\n\nIn recent years, many states also have passed gestational bans prohibiting abortion at various stages of pregnancy. Courts have blocked many of those laws in response to legal challenges, including laws in Georgia, Ohio, and Idaho that ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Now those laws may take effect immediately. So too, could a law recently enacted in Oklahoma , that makes performing abortion a felony punishable by time in prison.\n\n\"It will be a tremendous change in an incredibly short period of time,\" said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights. Rikelman argued the Center's challenge to Mississippi's abortion ban at Supreme Court this term.\n\nA host of other restrictions could limit where, by whom, and under what conditions abortion can be provided. Some examples include laws requiring parental notification or consent for abortions involving patients who are minors; and other health regulations for doctors and clinics that many medical groups say are unnecessary, expensive, and difficult to comply with.\n\nFinally, Liebel said some governors may consider calling special sessions to pass new legislation in response to Friday's ruling.\n\nLegal experts say the court's decision will pose new questions for other courts to deal with - questions about how to apply the specific language of the final ruling to individual state laws.\n\nRikelman, the Center for Reproductive rights attorney, predicts \"legal chaos\" in states across the country in the immediate aftermath of the decision.\n\n\"I think what we will see is far more litigation in the federal courts - not less litigation,\" Rikelman said.\n\nSome states such as Texas and Oklahoma have multiple abortion restrictions on the books, raising potential questions about which ones would be valid. Those laws each include different provisions and carry different penalties, adding to the potential confusion and prompting additional litigation in state and federal courts.\n\nLiebel, with SBA Pro-Life America, acknowledged that more legal battles are likely.\n\n\"That's gonna take us back, frankly, to where we always have been. Each side tries to put their big toe right on that line and push the envelope,\" Liebel said.\n\nBattles in state courts are also likely. Some state constitutions may offer protections for abortion rights notwithstanding the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. In Florida, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union and other reproductive rights groups are challenging a 15-week abortion ban modeled on Mississippi's law, on the grounds that it violates privacy rights protections guaranteed in Florida's state constitution.\n\nEven without overturning Roe , Rikelman points to the Texas law known as S.B. 8, which took effect in September . The law, which has spawned several copycat proposals in other states, including Oklahoma , relies on individuals filing civil lawsuits to enforce an abortion ban.\n\nAbortion bans in restrictive states will likely bleed over to states that protect abortion rights as well, Rikelman said. She notes that some state lawmakers are trying to prohibit people in other states from providing abortions to their residents.\n\n\"What we are seeing already are states and state legislators impacting even people's ability to access abortion in places where it would remain legal,\" she said.\n\nFor example, an omnibus abortion law passed by a Republican supermajority in Kentucky earlier this year includes a host of new requirements for dispensing medication abortion pills, and a provision for extraditing people from other states who illegally provide abortion pills to Kentuckians. It's unclear how enforceable those types of laws would be.\n\nMeanwhile, some states are trying to expand access to abortion in preparation for more patients traveling from restrictive states for procedures. Connecticut lawmakers passed legislation this year designed to protect abortion providers from out-of-state lawsuits.\n\n\"This just raises a whole host of issues,\" Rikelman said. \"All of those different disputes will have to be worked out in the courts\" including, potentially, in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWhat's more, the anti-abortion movement will not be satisfied with this win, observes University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman.  \"The next time the Republicans win control of the Senate and White House and the House of Representatives a national abortion ban is going to be on the table,\" she said in an interview.\n\nEven as abortions have now become far more restricted overall, the Guttmacher Institute reports that the long-term decline in abortions has reversed. In 2020, there were 930,160 abortions in the U.S., an increase of 8 percent more abortions than in 2017. The Institute also said that at the same time, fewer people were getting pregnant and among those who did, a larger proportion chose to have an abortion.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "New Dwyane Wade statue honors the NBA star. But some fans say it misses the mark\n\nJuliana Kim\n\nFormer Miami Heat NBA basketball player Dwyane Wade looks at a bronze statue of his likeness during its unveiling ceremony outside the Kaseya Center in Miami, Fla. on Oct. 27. Michael Laughlin/AP hide caption\n\nIf not for the Miami No. 3 jersey, it might be difficult to recognize that a new statue outside the Kaseya Center is none other than basketball superstar Dwyane Wade.\n\nThe bronze statue was unveiled Sunday in honor of the former Miami Heat player, who made his professional basketball debut with the team 21 years ago this October. Placed near the front doors of the arena, it's accompanied by a wall highlighting Wade's achievements, from being a Basketball Hall of Famer to a 13-time All Star.\n\nThe statue, designed by Timeless Creations' Omri Amrany and Oscar León, was meant to capture Wade in mid-celebration, reenacting his iconic \"This is my house\" gesture after he hit a winning 3-pointer against the Chicago Bulls in 2009.\n\nAt a press conference on Sunday, Wade said it was his idea to pay homage to the 2009 game, describing it as the biggest moment of his career. He applauded the artists for working with him to get every detail right, including the fact that he was chewing gum.\n\n\"I want to make sure that every fan, when they see it, you know, they remember my career and I think that sums up my career,\" he said. \"People are going to be driving and they're going to look up and I'm going to be like, 'This is my house.' I was like, 'That's gonna be pretty cool from the street.'\"\n\nWade later called the statue \"beautiful\" and \"it's one of the best statues that's been created\" - though he acknowledged he had some bias. Fans, on the other hand, were less thrilled. Many said online that they were confused and disappointed at the long-awaited unveiling.\n\n\"The Miami Heat should've had a contest where they showed this picture to 1,000 fans - and anyone who guesses it's Dwyane Wade gets to keep the statue,\" ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington joked on X .\n\n\"This is a joke right? Because literally not one feature - nose, lips, eyes - looks anything like Dwayne Wade,\" another X user wrote.\n\nOthers on social media said the statue did resemble a famous person - just not Wade - but rather, former professional boxer George Foreman and Matrix actor Laurence Fishburne.\n\nWill Manso, the sports director of WPLG Local 10 News, said the statue looked better up close and in person. \"In the end Dwyane is happy and that's all that matters. He had four trips with the sculptors to get the right pose and look. He said it's beautiful,\" Manso wrote on X .\n\nStatue of Cristiano Ronaldo at a ceremony where Madeira Airport was renamed after the soccer star on March 29, 2017 in Santa Cruz, Madeira, Portugal. Octavio Passos/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThis is not the first time that fans have been unimpressed by an immortalized artwork of their favorite celebrity. In 2017, a bronze bust of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo bewildered fans for failing to capture his chiseled features. Earlier this year, a statue of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant faced criticism not only for its lack of resemblance but also for spelling errors on its marble base.\n\nThere was another notable outcry after a statue of Lucille Ball was unveiled in her hometown of Celoron, New York, in 2009, dubbed \"Scary Lucy\" by locals. After a viral social media campaign, the statue was replaced with a new one by another artist in 2016.\n\nAnd just last month, people in the United Kingdom were underwhelmed by a new sculpture of Queen Elizabeth II, unveiled last month in Northern Ireland. The statue depicted Elizabeth in a skirt, rubber boots and a headscarf - sparking the joke that it looked more like Mrs. Doubtfire than the late queen.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. What's next? Your health questions answered\n\nBy\n\nSelena Simmons-Duffin\n\n,\n\nWynne Davis\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an abortion case this week. The court's conservative justices are overturning Roe v. Wade. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an abortion case this week. The court's conservative justices are overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade on Friday. This decision will mean laws further restricting abortion care and services will go into effect in many states. Following May's leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion in which the justices appear ready to overturn Roe , we asked you what questions you had for our experts about abortion care and access in the U.S.\n\nMany of you wrote in wanting to know more about the impact this decision could have on hospitals, in vitro fertilization, and care for miscarriages. To answer those questions, we reached out to Kristyn Brandi, an OB-GYN and family planning doctor, who is also the board chair for Physicians for Reproductive Health, and NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin.\n\nMiscarriage care is definitely going to be impacted - it's already happening in Texas.\n\nA lot of times people think about miscarriage as something that's spontaneous, that somebody has no control over. That can be true, but it can also be something that people have to make decisions about. The standard of care for treating a miscarriage is the same as the standard of care for providing an abortion.\n\nThe way that can play out is if somebody has a miscarriage and they need to take medication to empty the uterus so they're not at risk of infection, that same medication is what's used for medication abortion. There have already been a lot of reports of pharmacists in Texas not filling those prescriptions for people who are suffering miscarriages.\n\nThere's nothing in these laws that says if there's a miscarriage somebody has to prove it, but there are reports, including one from a woman in Texas , about doctors questioning patients about medications they might have taken or how they might have caused a miscarriage to happen. In practical terms, getting the right treatment, on time, without barriers or questioning, might still end up being really challenging.\n\n- Selena Simmons-Duffin\n\nThe question of whether somebody will die from pregnancy is rarely black and white. Restrictive abortion laws often have exemptions for medical emergencies that require treatment that might involve ending a pregnancy.\n\nThere are about 700 pregnancy deaths a year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of those deaths are from heart disease and stroke. But, under these new restrictions, if you develop a condition like preeclampsia early in pregnancy - which could put you at high risk for a stroke - the exemption wouldn't necessarily apply. You may have to continue the pregnancy despite the risks.\n\nOne very urgent medical situation that can come up is when someone's water breaks too early. This is what happened 10 years ago to Savita Halappanavar - a dentist in Ireland whose water broke 17 weeks into a pregnancy. A heartbeat was still detectable, so she was denied an abortion because it was legally banned in Ireland and she ended up developing an infection and dying. Her death spurred Ireland to legalize abortion in 2018.\n\nWe are already seeing similar stories in Texas, despite the emergency exemption written into that law.\n\n- Selena Simmons-Duffin\n\nAnti-abortion rights activists counter-demonstrate as abortion rights activists participate in a \"flash mob\" demonstration outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 22 in Washington, D.C. Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nAnti-abortion rights activists counter-demonstrate as abortion rights activists participate in a \"flash mob\" demonstration outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 22 in Washington, D.C.\n\nTo put it another way, could people be compelled to carry a pregnancy to term even if it is clear that the fetus will not survive outside the womb?\n\nAccording to Brandi, the answer to that could be yes.\n\n\"When I have a patient that is facing that outcome, I want to talk to them about their options and make sure that they can decide if and when and how to end that pregnancy,\" she says.\n\n\"According to these abortion bans, there's not a lot of language that allows for abortion in the cases of lethal fetal anomalies. People that are in states where abortion is restricted likely will have to continue those pregnancies to term and they would deliver how they normally would deliver either by a natural birth, potentially even a C-section, and they likely wouldn't be able to have the palliative care system support them in an outcome that would help them, you know, grieve the potential loss of this child.\"\n\nThat's an important question, Brandi says, adding that she is also concerned about whether the health care system is ready to face the increasing number of patients who will be coming to hospitals needing labor and delivery care because they weren't able to access abortion care.\n\n\"Rural areas, even before COVID, were facing lots of closures of hospitals and particularly labor and delivery wards,\" she says. \"People were already traveling long distances to get all types of care, and women's health providers were leaving those areas. Imagine now when we double or triple the number of deliveries that are happening in those communities.\"\n\nProtesters march near the U.S. Supreme Court to call for abortion rights protection on May 28 in Washington, D.C. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images hide caption\n\nProtesters march near the U.S. Supreme Court to call for abortion rights protection on May 28 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe short answer is in vitro fertilization, or IVF, could be affected by these laws. That's because the way certain words are defined in many of these new laws often don't match the medical definitions.\n\nIn Texas, the law in place says that pregnancy begins with \"fertilization\" - when a sperm and an egg meet. But in medicine, pregnancy is defined as beginning after that fertilized egg divides, grows and implants in the uterus .\n\nA lot of laws also include a line that says \"an 'Unborn child' means a human fetus or embryo in any stage of gestation from fertilization until birth.\" By that definition, unused embryos that were created for IVF are unborn children, and many times when people go through IVF there are lots of embryos created that end up unused and are routinely discarded.\n\nWhether IVF will be limited through these or future laws is still up in the air, according to Liz Sepper , a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"The anti-abortion movement is, in some measure, a religious fundamentalist movement that takes some of Catholic theology and combines it with some of the evangelical Christian tradition and politics,\" she said. \"Conservative Catholics are opposed to fertility treatments, to IVF, but that has not been a target for evangelical Christians who are supportive of IVF in order to procreate.\"\n\nOverall, it is hard to predict the consequences that overturning Roe might have on IVF because it seems the anti-abortion rights movement is not united on this point.\n\n- Selena Simmons-Duffin\n\nYes, there are condoms and vasectomies. But what about newer advancements in male birth control?\n\n\"I really wish that I had better news to share about the new innovations in male birth control,\" Brandi says. \"Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of drive for men to use birth control as far as current things that are in the works.\"\n\nSeveral clinical trials looking at pills, injections and other procedures for men are ongoing, but Brandi said it will be several years before those options would be available. Condoms and vasectomies are the best options available to men who want to help prevent pregnancy in their relationships, she added.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Wade , abortion rights opponents will hold a March for Life Friday in Washington, D.C., and celebrate the overturning of the landmark court ruling.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This weekend marks 50 years since the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: The ruling established a constitutional right to abortion during the early parts of pregnancy. It also froze many state laws that banned abortion, and it led to a generations-long drive to overturn it, which included an annual March for Life in Washington. Last year, the Supreme Court overturned its abortion decision, but the annual march goes ahead today. INSKEEP: NPR's Sarah McCammon is covering the March for Life. Hey there, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What is the organizers' thinking in going ahead? MCCAMMON: Well, the march started in 1974, one year after the Roe v. Wade decision, and it was a direct response to it. So, of course, the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision last year - with that, the movement achieved its goal of overturning Roe. But they note that about a dozen states have enacted abortion bans in response to that decision. And in many states, abortion remains legal. So activists involved in the march say there's more work to do until abortion is unavailable anywhere. Denise Harle is with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom and is participating. DENISE HARLE: It's kind of just beginning in a lot of ways. This next phase of the pro-life movement is so important and really exciting because there is still a long way to go. MCCAMMON: So this year, Steve, the march, instead of ending at the Supreme Court, is ending between the Supreme Court and Congress as a sign that they see the fight as continuing at all levels of government. INSKEEP: What are those battles this year? MCCAMMON: Well, a lot of them are at the state level. Abortion opponents want to go farther, expand the number of states that have banned abortion. In Virginia, for example, where abortion is currently still legal, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is backing a proposal to ban the procedure after 15 weeks. There are efforts underway at both the state and federal levels to restrict access to abortion pills, which now account for most abortions in this country. And many anti-abortion groups want to see a national 15-week ban. That, of course, is a longer-term effort on their part because right now they don't have the votes in Congress or, of course, the presidency. INSKEEP: So if that's what abortion rights opponents are going for in 2023, what about groups who support abortion rights? MCCAMMON: Well, of course, they're trying to hold off new state restrictions. They want to protect abortion providers in states with legal abortion and expand access to care. And they're trying to keep voters focused on the issue. Rachel O'Leary Carmona is executive director of the Women's March. RACHEL O'LEARY CARMONA: We've seen successes. In every place that a ballot measure has gone in front of the people, the people have come down on the side of reproductive freedom and abortion rights. MCCAMMON: And she's energized by the November midterms, where several states had abortion-related questions on the ballot. That's going to be a key strategy for abortion rights activists in many states going forward. And as they point out, you know, years of polling, including a new NPR/Marist poll out just this month, have found that a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion. So that's a reality that anti-abortion groups like the March for Life will have to contend with as they celebrate abortion bans that often, Steve, are out of step with the majority of public opinion.

Last year, the Supreme Court overturned its abortion decision, but the annual march goes ahead today. INSKEEP: NPR's Sarah McCammon is covering the March for Life. Hey there, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What is the organizers' thinking in going ahead? MCCAMMON: Well, the march started in 1974, one year after the Roe v. Wade decision, and it was a direct response to it. So, of course, the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision last year - with that, the movement achieved its goal of overturning Roe. But they note that about a dozen states have enacted abortion bans in response to that decision. And in many states, abortion remains legal. So activists involved in the march say there's more work to do until abortion is unavailable anywhere. Denise Harle is with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom and is participating. DENISE HARLE: It's kind of just beginning in a lot of ways. This next phase of the pro-life movement is so important and really exciting because there is still a long way to go. MCCAMMON: So this year, Steve, the march, instead of ending at the Supreme Court, is ending between the Supreme Court and Congress as a sign that they see the fight as continuing at all levels of government. INSKEEP: What are those battles this year? MCCAMMON: Well, a lot of them are at the state level. Abortion opponents want to go farther, expand the number of states that have banned abortion. In Virginia, for example, where abortion is currently still legal, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is backing a proposal to ban the procedure after 15 weeks. There are efforts underway at both the state and federal levels to restrict access to abortion pills, which now account for most abortions in this country. And many anti-abortion groups want to see a national 15-week ban. That, of course, is a longer-term effort on their part because right now they don't have the votes in Congress or, of course, the presidency. INSKEEP: So if that's what abortion rights opponents are going for in 2023, what about groups who support abortion rights? MCCAMMON: Well, of course, they're trying to hold off new state restrictions. They want to protect abortion providers in states with legal abortion and expand access to care. And they're trying to keep voters focused on the issue. Rachel O'Leary Carmona is executive director of the Women's March. RACHEL O'LEARY CARMONA: We've seen successes. In every place that a ballot measure has gone in front of the people, the people have come down on the side of reproductive freedom and abortion rights. MCCAMMON: And she's energized by the November midterms, where several states had abortion-related questions on the ballot. That's going to be a key strategy for abortion rights activists in many states going forward. And as they point out, you know, years of polling, including a new NPR/Marist poll out just this month, have found that a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion. So that's a reality that anti-abortion groups like the March for Life will have to contend with as they celebrate abortion bans that often, Steve, are out of step with the majority of public opinion.

But they note that about a dozen states have enacted abortion bans in response to that decision. And in many states, abortion remains legal. So activists involved in the march say there's more work to do until abortion is unavailable anywhere. Denise Harle is with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom and is participating. DENISE HARLE: It's kind of just beginning in a lot of ways. This next phase of the pro-life movement is so important and really exciting because there is still a long way to go. MCCAMMON: So this year, Steve, the march, instead of ending at the Supreme Court, is ending between the Supreme Court and Congress as a sign that they see the fight as continuing at all levels of government. INSKEEP: What are those battles this year? MCCAMMON: Well, a lot of them are at the state level. Abortion opponents want to go farther, expand the number of states that have banned abortion. In Virginia, for example, where abortion is currently still legal, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is backing a proposal to ban the procedure after 15 weeks. There are efforts underway at both the state and federal levels to restrict access to abortion pills, which now account for most abortions in this country. And many anti-abortion groups want to see a national 15-week ban. That, of course, is a longer-term effort on their part because right now they don't have the votes in Congress or, of course, the presidency. INSKEEP: So if that's what abortion rights opponents are going for in 2023, what about groups who support abortion rights? MCCAMMON: Well, of course, they're trying to hold off new state restrictions. They want to protect abortion providers in states with legal abortion and expand access to care. And they're trying to keep voters focused on the issue. Rachel O'Leary Carmona is executive director of the Women's March. RACHEL O'LEARY CARMONA: We've seen successes. In every place that a ballot measure has gone in front of the people, the people have come down on the side of reproductive freedom and abortion rights. MCCAMMON: And she's energized by the November midterms, where several states had abortion-related questions on the ballot. That's going to be a key strategy for abortion rights activists in many states going forward. And as they point out, you know, years of polling, including a new NPR/Marist poll out just this month, have found that a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion. So that's a reality that anti-abortion groups like the March for Life will have to contend with as they celebrate abortion bans that often, Steve, are out of step with the majority of public opinion.

In every place that a ballot measure has gone in front of the people, the people have come down on the side of reproductive freedom and abortion rights. MCCAMMON: And she's energized by the November midterms, where several states had abortion-related questions on the ballot. That's going to be a key strategy for abortion rights activists in many states going forward. And as they point out, you know, years of polling, including a new NPR/Marist poll out just this month, have found that a majority of Americans support access to legal abortion. So that's a reality that anti-abortion groups like the March for Life will have to contend with as they celebrate abortion bans that often, Steve, are out of step with the majority of public opinion.

Abortion opponents want to go farther, expand the number of states that have banned abortion. In Virginia, for example, where abortion is currently still legal, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is backing a proposal to ban the procedure after 15 weeks. There are efforts underway at both the state and federal levels to restrict access to abortion pills, which now account for most abortions in this country. And many anti-abortion groups want to see a national 15-week ban. That, of course, is a longer-term effort on their part because right now they don't have the votes in Congress or, of course, the presidency. INSKEEP: So if that's what abortion rights opponents are going for in 2023, what about groups who support abortion rights? MCCAMMON: Well, of course, they're trying to hold off new state restrictions. They want to protect abortion providers in states with legal abortion and expand access to care.

      "text": "The overturning of Roe v. Wade made history in 2022\n\nSarah McCammon\n\nThe constitutional right to abortion ended this year, with clinics closing in states that banned the procedure, and patients who could traveling to states where abortion is allowed.\n\nALINA SELYUKH, HOST: 2022 saw the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the historic Supreme Court decision that had guaranteed the right to abortion in the U.S. for nearly 50 years. NPR's national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights policy, and she has this look back on a history-making year. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: The year began with high hopes for the anti-abortion rights movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNE MANCINI: We are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life. MCCAMMON: In January, March for Life president Jeanne Mancini told activists gathering on the National Mall for their annual rally that she was full of anticipation as the Supreme Court prepared to release its decision in a major abortion case. The court's conservative majority was more powerful than ever, with three justices appointed by former President Trump. Mancini told marchers from around the country that soon the fight would become much more local. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANCINI: If Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states and here in D.C. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, in Texas, the reality of what a post-Roe America could look like was already coming into view. Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: They couldn't even say the word abortion. Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

Wade, the historic Supreme Court decision that had guaranteed the right to abortion in the U.S. for nearly 50 years. NPR's national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights policy, and she has this look back on a history-making year. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: The year began with high hopes for the anti-abortion rights movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNE MANCINI: We are hoping and praying that this year, 2022, will bring a historic change for life. MCCAMMON: In January, March for Life president Jeanne Mancini told activists gathering on the National Mall for their annual rally that she was full of anticipation as the Supreme Court prepared to release its decision in a major abortion case. The court's conservative majority was more powerful than ever, with three justices appointed by former President Trump. Mancini told marchers from around the country that soon the fight would become much more local. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANCINI: If Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states and here in D.C. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, in Texas, the reality of what a post-Roe America could look like was already coming into view. Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: They couldn't even say the word abortion. Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected.

She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

MCCAMMON: In January, March for Life president Jeanne Mancini told activists gathering on the National Mall for their annual rally that she was full of anticipation as the Supreme Court prepared to release its decision in a major abortion case. The court's conservative majority was more powerful than ever, with three justices appointed by former President Trump. Mancini told marchers from around the country that soon the fight would become much more local. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANCINI: If Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states and here in D.C. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, in Texas, the reality of what a post-Roe America could look like was already coming into view. Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations.

Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

The court's conservative majority was more powerful than ever, with three justices appointed by former President Trump. Mancini told marchers from around the country that soon the fight would become much more local. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MANCINI: If Roe falls, the battle lines will change. But make no mistake, the fight for life will need to continue in the states and here in D.C. MCCAMMON: Meanwhile, in Texas, the reality of what a post-Roe America could look like was already coming into view. Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: They couldn't even say the word abortion. Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected.

The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

Most abortions had become illegal after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state law called SB 8 to take effect a few months earlier, banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In a novel legal strategy designed to get around existing precedent, SB 8 empowered individuals to sue abortion providers and others believed to be involved in illegal abortions. The law meant some patients like Anna, a woman from central Texas who suffered a miscarriage in 2021, were denied emergency terminations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: They couldn't even say the word abortion. Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous.

Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

Like, I could see the fear in these doctors' eyes that they were just so scared to even talk about it. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR a few months later, Anna, who asked us not to use her last name for fear of potential legal repercussions for her doctor, said her water broke at 19 weeks, just under halfway through the pregnancy. She and her husband went to an emergency room, where doctors told her there was no chance the baby could survive and that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: You're at a high chance of going septic or bleeding out, and unfortunately, we recommend termination. But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights.

Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

But we cannot provide you one here in Texas because of this law. MCCAMMON: Anna became one of the first patients facing an abortion ban, but certainly not the last, to get on a plane and travel to another state while in the midst of a medical crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) ANNA: I had to come up with a game plan with my OB in case I went into labor on the flight, and I made sure that I bought us front-row of seats so I could be close to the bathroom in case it happened. And - (crying) like, no one should ever have to do that. MCCAMMON: Then in late June, the U.S. Supreme Court released the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, sending the status of abortion law into chaos around the country. Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state.

Some clinics had to shut down with patients still in the waiting room in states with laws designed to quickly ban abortion after the fall of Roe. Reproductive rights lawyers fought back, challenging some of those laws in state courts. In Louisiana, just days after the Dobbs decision. They won a brief reprieve. At the Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, staff members scrambled to keep up with calls from confused and anxious patients. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) STEFFI CHAFFEE: We're back to being able to schedule. What, did you have an appointment with us or what? You mean for your first visit? OK, well, we're not scheduling for first visits right now, honey. We're already booked up. So - well, I understand, honey. The whole thing isn't fair. MCCAMMON: One patient who managed to get an appointment, there was a 27-year-old woman from Texas. She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly. MCCAMMON: Around the country, clinics and states where abortion remains legal have been coping with an influx of patients by the thousands determined to get abortions, even if they have to travel out of state. Abortion funds and logistical support networks have stepped in to help with the costs of travel and other needs. LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

She asked us to call her by the letter J rather than her full name for fear of stigma back home. J told me she was struggling as a stay-at-home mom to three young children. And after serious medical complications in previous pregnancies, she was devastated to find out she was pregnant again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) J: I was really scared. I thought I was going to have to travel 12 hours to Albuquerque because of Roe v. Wade being overturned. I had a panic attack that day. MCCAMMON: That same week in Indiana, Dr. Caitlin Bernard was taking care of a 10-year-old who'd become pregnant as a result of rape. The girl had traveled from neighboring Ohio after a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest took effect there. In an interview with NPR in late July, Dr. Bernard said she was worried about the impact of abortion bans on patients facing a variety of complex pregnancy decisions in an increasingly confusing legal environment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CAITLIN BERNARD: When you take away someone's right to privacy about their medical decisions, the challenges that they face to access lifesaving health care is going to be enormous. MCCAMMON: After prominent conservatives questioned Bernard's credibility without providing evidence. The story became a symbol of the fight over abortion access that had been triggered by the Dobbs decision. The state of Indiana eventually produced documents supporting Bernard's version of events. Many anti-abortion rights activists continued to oppose rape exceptions, insisting abortion is always wrong. Pam Whitehead, who lives in Texas and leads the anti-abortion group ProLove Ministries, says her views were shaped partly by her own experiences. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) PAM WHITEHEAD: I can't imagine being in that situation. I know what it's like to be raped, though. I also know what it's like to have an abortion. And I'll tell you this, that that abortion impacted me greatly.

LaQuetta Cooper with Planned Parenthood of the Saint Louis region and southwest Missouri, says the influx to Illinois was even bigger than expected. Her affiliate recently announced the launch of a mobile abortion unit that can travel throughout southern Illinois, offering abortion pills and eventually procedures closer to patients in states like Missouri, where abortion is unavailable. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) LAQUETTA COOPER: The biggest needs that we are seeing is the fact that they have to travel so far to get the care that they need. This will be helpful so that they don't have to travel three to five hours trying to get the abortion care that they need. MCCAMMON: Anti-abortion rights groups are taking notice, working to tighten regulations on pills and looking for ways to make it harder for providers to serve patients across state lines. Just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters had a chance to weigh in. Nationwide, voters in the 2022 midterms listed abortion rights among their top concerns in exit polls. And in several states where the issue was on the ballot, including red states like Kansas and Kentucky, voters signaled support for abortion rights. Already, abortion rights groups say they're looking ahead to future elections, hoping to put the question directly to voters in more states. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

Wade, there's chaos and confusion\n\nVanessa Romo\n\nDemonstrators protest about abortion outside the Supreme Court in Washington, June 24, 2022. In the year since, approximately 22 million women, girls and other people of reproductive age now live in states where abortion access is heavily restricted or totally inaccessible. Jacquelyn Martin/AP hide caption\n\nDemonstrators protest about abortion outside the Supreme Court in Washington, June 24, 2022. In the year since, approximately 22 million women, girls and other people of reproductive age now live in states where abortion access is heavily restricted or totally inaccessible.\n\nOne year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, putting an end to the constitutionally protected right to access abortion, the health care landscape has become increasingly fragmented and complex to navigate, spawning widespread confusion.\n\nSo far, more than a dozen states have enacted extremely restrictive abortion bans, with the majority making no exceptions for rape or incest. And many more are waiting on legal challenges to make their way through the courts. In Texas, private citizens can sue abortion providers and those who assist patients seeking an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThat has left approximately 22 million women, girls and other people of reproductive age now living in states where abortion access is heavily restricted or totally inaccessible. In the nine months following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , abortions with providers fell by a monthly average of 2,849 compared to April 2022, new data collected by the Society of Family Planning shows.\n\nWith individual states empowered to ban abortion, some health care professionals say they are trapped by poorly drafted laws that criminalize care and fail to consider how women and other pregnant people might inadvertently be affected, including those who had not planned to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\"States that have banned abortion are also threatening the health and well-being of people with wanted pregnancies who face obstetric emergency,\" Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute, told NPR.\n\n\"Doctors and hospitals do not know how to operate, or [they're] operating under a really dark cloud of suspicion and hostility,\" Baden added.\n\nHalf of the doctors in states with abortion bans say that they have patients who have been unable to obtain an abortion, according to a national KFF survey of OBGYNs released Wednesday. About 40% reported facing constraints on their care for miscarriages and pregnancy-related emergencies. Meanwhile, 61% of those practicing in states with abortion bans express concerns about legal risks when making decisions about patient care.\n\nAnd a majority of OBGYNs say they believe that the Dobbs decision has also exacerbated pregnancy-related mortality, racial and ethnic inequities in maternal health and made it harder to attract new OBGYNs to the field.\n\nLoren Colson is a family medicine physician in Idaho, a state with only about a half-dozen maternal fetal medicine physicians remaining. He described the scene across the state as one of \"complete chaos.\"\n\nIdaho has implemented a ban on abortion at conception. Exceptions can be made if the mother's life is in jeopardy. \"But there's been a huge question of what that means,\" Colson told NPR.\n\nColson, who has testified before the Idaho Senate on the issue, said the law is written so vaguely that there is no common understanding  between lawmakers and doctors of what constitutes a life-threatening situation.\n\n\"We think that they know where that line is, when it has come down to it,\" he said, \"but when the idea of jail time is on the table, everyone gets confused.\"\n\nColson, like numerous other physicians around the country, is calling on legislators to include more precise medical language in the bans that have been enacted.\n\nAnother KFF survey published last month revealed that there is broad uncertainty around the legal status of abortion among the general population. In the states where abortion is banned, about 1 in 8 residents incorrectly believes that medication abortion is still legal there. And more than half of residents say they are unsure of the legality of abortion in their state.\n\nIn the wake of the Dobbs decision, some states have passed protective legislation with the aim of expanding access and protecting providers. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia have laws protecting abortion. And over the last 12 months, at least 15 municipal and six state governments allocated nearly $208 million to pay for contraception, abortion and support services for people seeking abortions, according to data provided to NPR by the National Institute for Reproductive Health.\n\nThe funding, which has shot up from approximately $55 million since 2019, allocates money for abortion funds and support networks that provide financial assistance to people struggling to pay for procedures, travel and other associated costs.\n\nPolitically, the Dobbs decision has mobilized both parties, and politicians are counting on the issue to bring voters to the polls in 2024. Republicans, backed by anti-abortion groups including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, are seeking to codify a 15-week ban nationwide.\n\nDemocrats have also galvanized around the rollback of Roe . They are warning voters that Dobbs is only the first of future attempts to limit people's autonomy over their own bodies and health care, including contraception and LGBTQIA issues.\n\nNPR's Sarah McCammon and Selena Simmons-Duffin contributed to this story.\n\nAn earlier version of this story mistakenly described Loren Colson as a maternal fetal medicine physician who testified before the Idaho House of Representatives. He is, in fact, a family medicine physician who testified before the Idaho Senate. Also, an earlier version of this story incorrectly said Idaho bans abortion beyond six weeks gestational age. In fact, Idaho bans abortion at conception, with a few exceptions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Wade\n\nDomenico Montanaro\n\nThousands of abortion-rights activists gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after it overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case and erased a federal right to an abortion. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThousands of abortion-rights activists gather in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after it overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case and erased a federal right to an abortion.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of what the Supreme Court did Friday with its outright overturning of Roe v. Wade , the landmark ruling that made abortion legal in this country nearly 50 years ago.\n\n\"It's the legal equivalent of a nuclear bomb,\" NPR's Nina Totenberg, the dean of Supreme Court reporters, noted, adding that it's possible this ruling opens the door for the potential \"for undoing other areas of personal autonomy,\" from contraception to interracial marriage.\n\nThere are lots of questions we have about what happens now to society and in politics. Here are six:\n\n1. What happens for access to abortion now?\n\nThe Supreme Court is leaving it to the states to decide how to regulate - or outlaw - abortion. Twenty-two states have trigger laws in place that will outlaw abortion immediately.\n\nAlmost all are in red states, or places Donald Trump won in the presidential election. The U.S. is now going to have a patchwork of laws.\n\nIn red states with legislatures controlled by Republicans, an abortion is likely to be banned or made much more difficult to get.\n\nAnd in blue states, places Democrats traditionally win in presidential elections and control the legislatures, abortion access will remain in place. It will make for a very unsettling round of new laws and regulations across the country.\n\n2. Does the court go further, after other rights?\n\nJustice Thomas wrote that he wants the court to reexamine precedents on cases dealing with contraception, same-sex marriage and even same-sex sex.\n\nOther conservative justices said they disagree with that, but few thought the Supreme Court would go even this far and outright overturn Roe .\n\nOne thing is clear, this isn't Chief Justice Roberts' court anymore. He wrote a concurrent opinion advocating for upholding Mississippi's 15-week ban, but not to go beyond that.\n\nThe court's conservative supermajority didn't listen. It's their court now. If they band together, there's no telling how they can - and will - reshape American society and culture.\n\n3. What will this mean for the Supreme Court's credibility?\n\nPublic opinion has been clear and consistent - a solid majority of Americans want abortion, with restrictions, to remain legal, but the Supreme Court opinion outright overturning Roe is woefully out of step with the American public.\n\nThe court's credibility has declined and opinion of it has become more polarized this year. With the leak of the Roe draft opinion in May, it took a nosedive.\n\nGallup released numbers on Thursday that showed just 25% now say they have a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in the Supreme Court. That's the lowest in the 50 years that Gallup has been asking the question.\n\n4. Will the idea of doing away with the filibuster and packing the court become more mainstream?\n\nExpect there to be a movement among progressives to add more justices to the court.\n\n\"The idea of adding Supreme Court justices, which I thought didn't have a leg to stand on, I think, at some point, may have traction,\" Totenberg noted.\n\nDemocrats don't have the votes for that at this point. But given the court's credibility problem - and how far out of step overturning Roe is with the broader public - do these ideas start to catch on?\n\n5. How do Democrats and liberals respond more broadly?\n\nIt took half a century of meticulous planning, vetting and building a movement to get to this point for anti-abortion-rights conservatives.\n\nThey have not only mobilized for presidential elections, but also down-ballot ones, like state legislative races. Democrats have built up some apparatus to compete in those races in recent years after being largely absent for a decade or so, before and during the Obama administration.\n\nBut with the relative young ages of the Supreme Court nominees and the stranglehold Republicans have on many statehouses across the country, this is an aircraft carrier that's likely to take a very long time to turn - certainly far longer than one or two election cycles.\n\n6. Will it shake up the 2022 election?\n\nWhile surveys show that Roe being overturned would fire up Democrats to vote more than Republicans, the decision is unlikely to change the forecast for control of the House.\n\nRepublicans are favored to take the House and that's unlikely to change. So far, in the short term, people say they are more concerned about inflation and gas prices as motivating factors.\n\nBut this ruling undoubtedly introduces a wildcard. And it will be important to closely watch how the political landscape moves in the coming weeks.\n\nThis ruling not only will affect this upcoming election but the next one - the 2024 presidential election. That is especially true considering former President Trump is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, and it's because of his Supreme Court nominations that this day is here.\n\nIt would have been a very different world had Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Draft Overturning Roe v. Wade Quotes Infamous Witch Trial Judge With Long-Discredited Ideas on Rape\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, in a draft opinion obtained and published this week by Politico, detailed his justifications for overturning Roe v. Wade, he invoked a surprising name given the case's subject. In writing about abortion, a matter inextricably tied to a woman's control over her body, Alito chose to quote from Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century English jurist whose writings and reasonings have caused enduring damage to women for hundreds of years.\n\nThe so-called marital rape exemption - the legal notion that a married woman cannot be raped by her husband - traces to Hale. So does a long-used instruction to jurors to be skeptical of reports of rape. So, in a way, do the infamous Salem witch trials, in which women (and some men) were hanged on or near Gallows Hill.\n\nHale's influence in the United States has been on the wane since the 1970s, with one state after another abandoning his legal principles on rape. But Alito's opinion resurrects Hale, a judge who was considered misogynistic even by his era's notably low standards. Hale once wrote a long letter to his grandchildren, dispensing life advice, in which he veered into a screed against women, describing them as \"chargeable unprofitable people\" who \"know the ready way to consume an estate, and to ruin a family quickly.\" Hale particularly despaired of the changes he saw in young women, writing, \"And now the world is altered: young gentlewomen learn to be bold\" and \"talk loud.\"\n\nHale became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1671. In his time (Hale's contemporaries included Oliver Cromwell and Charles II), Hale was a respected, perhaps even venerated, jurist known for piety and sober judgment. He wrote a two-volume legal treatise, \"The History of the Pleas of the Crown,\" that has proved influential ever since.\n\nAlito, in his draft opinion, invokes \"eminent common-law authorities,\" including Hale, to show how abortion was viewed historically not as a right, but as a criminal act. \"Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a 'great crime' and a 'great misprision,'\" Alito wrote.\n\nEven before \"quickening\" - defined by Alito as \"the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy\" - Hale believed an abortion could qualify as homicide. \"Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman 'with child' a 'potion' to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was 'murder' because the potion was given 'unlawfully to destroy her child within her,'\" Alito wrote.\n\nCourts have long leaned on precedents established by old cases and the scholarship of legal authorities from centuries gone by. But what happens when you trace citations back to their ancient source? In Hale's case, you sometimes find a man conceiving precepts out of thin air. Other times it was the opposite, as he clung to notions that were already becoming anachronistic in the last half of the 17th century.\n\nConsider the marital rape exemption. In \"Pleas of the Crown,\" Hale wrote, \"The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract.\" So, according to Hale, marriage, for a woman, amounts to contractual forfeit, in which she loses legal protection or recourse should her husband sexually assault her.\n\nHale's pronouncement became the accepted common law and served as foundation in the United States for immunizing a husband accused of raping his wife. And where did Hale's pronouncement come from? What did he base it upon? Who knows? \"Hale appears to have been the first to articulate what later would become an accepted legal principle, that a husband cannot be charged with raping his wife,\" according to a footnote in one law review article . Another law review article, titled \" The Marital Rape Exemption: Evolution to Extinction ,\" called Hale's pronouncement \"an unsupported, extrajudicial statement\" lacking in authority.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, states began to abandon the marital rape exemption, in whole or in part. In 1981, the Supreme Court of New Jersey wrote that it could find no support for Hale's proposition among earlier writers. Hale's declaration, the court found, \"cannot itself be considered a definitive and binding statement of the common law, although legal commentators have often restated the rule since the time of Hale without evaluating its merits.\" In 1984, the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote : \"Hale's statement was not law, common or otherwise. At best it was Hale's pronouncement of what he observed to be a custom in 17th century England.\" The Virginia court went on to note, \"Moreover, Hale cites no authority for his view nor was it subsequently adopted, in its entirety, by the English courts.\"\n\nLike the marital rape exemption, the so-called Hale Warning to jurors caused centuries of misfortune in the American courts.\n\nIn \"Pleas of the Crown,\" Hale called rape a \"most detestable crime.\" Then, in words quoted many times since, he wrote, \"It must be remembered, that it is an accusation easy to be made and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.\"\n\nHale evoked the fear of the false accuser - and made for that fear a legal frame, which lasted for more than 300 years. In weighing the evidence in cases of alleged rape, jurors (all men, in Hale's time and for long after) needed to consider a series of factors, Hale wrote. Did the woman cry out? Did she try to flee? Was she of \"good fame\" or \"evil fame\"? Was she supported by others? Did she make immediate complaint afterward?\n\nHale's words and formulation became a standard feature of criminal trials in the United States, with jurors instructed by judges to be especially wary of allegations of rape. The effect was predictable: Charges of rape were frequently rejected. In the United States, one early example was chronicled by historian John Wood Sweet in his soon-to-be-published book, \" The Sewing Girl's Tale .\" (I was allowed to read an advance copy.)\n\nIn 1793, in New York City, an aristocrat, Henry Bedlow, was accused of raping a 17-year-old seamstress, Lanah Sawyer. Bedlow hired six lawyers, including a future U.S. Supreme Court justice, who used Hale's framework to destroy Sawyer. Sawyer said she screamed. But, one attorney asked the jury, did she also stamp her feet? Witnesses spoke of Sawyer's good fame, according to the trial record. But \"she may have had the art to carry a fair outside, while all was foul within,\" the same attorney argued. \"Ultimately, the defense team's dizzying effort to dispute and distort reality had been part of a relentless effort to transform a young woman who mattered into one who didn't,\" Sweet wrote. The jury took 15 minutes to acquit.\n\nStarting in the 1970s and 1980s, courts in the United States began moving away from instructing juries with Hale's admonition to be particularly skeptical of rape claims. The repudiation of Hale became so complete that when a Maryland lawmaker, in 2007, invoked Hale's words in a state legislative hearing, it was met with \"outrage,\" according to the Washington Post .\n\nDespite those legal changes, the fear of the false rape accuser still persists in the justice system, at times leading to horrendous outcomes. I began researching Hale when writing, with T. Christian Miller, \" An Unbelievable Story of Rape ,\" published by ProPublica and the Marshall Project. The story reconstructs what happened when a young woman in Lynnwood, Washington, reported being raped. We later expanded the story into a book, \"Unbelievable,\" in which we described Hale's influence in rape cases at greater length. (The story also became a Netflix series .)\n\nThen there was Hale's role in what today is synonymous with the perversion of justice: witch trials.\n\nIn 1662, Hale presided at a jury trial in Bury St. Edmunds in which two women, Amy Denny and Rose Cullender, were accused of being witches. In a book on this case, \"A Trial of Witches,\" authors Ivan Bunn and Gilbert Geis wrote that by 1662, \"belief in witches was in retreat in England.\" Hale, however, was not part of that retreat. He believed witches were real. \"Hale represented not a mainstream position but rather one rapidly becoming anachronistic,\" Bunn and Geis wrote.\n\nWhat's more, Hale instructed the jurors that witches were real. A written record of the trial recounts what Hale told them: \"That there were such creatures as witches he made no doubt at all; for first, the scriptures had affirmed so much. Secondly, the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such persons, which is an argument of their confidence of such a crime.\"\n\nThe jury convicted Denny and Cullender, after which Hale sentenced both women to hang. (Four years before, Hale had also sentenced to death another woman convicted of being a witch.)\n\nHale's influence, once again, extended beyond the immediate case and his time. Thirty years later, his handling of the trial in Bury St. Edmunds, preserved in written record, served as a model in Salem, Massachusetts, in the infamous witch trials in 1692. \"Indeed, the Salem witch-hunts might not have taken place if there had not been a trial at Bury St. Edmunds: the events at Salem notoriously imitated those at Bury,\" Bunn and Geis wrote.\n\nHale is known mostly for his legal treatises. But his views toward women are perhaps best revealed in a letter he wrote to his grandchildren, titled \"Letter of Advice.\" (In a twitter thread this week I said Hale's letter was 182 pages long. I may have understated it. I've since found a version online that goes on for 206 pages.)\n\nIn this letter, Hale prescribes individualized counsel for three granddaughters.\n\nMary, he wrote, possessed great wit and spirit, and \"if she can temper the latter, will make an excellent woman, and a great housewife; but if she cannot govern the greatness of her spirit, it will make her proud, imperious, and revengeful.\"\n\nFrances, he wrote, possessed great confidence: \"If she be kept in some awe, especially in relation to lying and deceiving, she will make a good woman and a good housewife.\"\n\nAnn, he wrote, possessed a \"soft nature.\" \"She must not see plays, read comedies, or love books or romances, nor hear nor learn ballads or idle songs, especially such as are wanton or concerning love-matters, for they will make too deep an impression upon her mind.\"\n\nHale complained in his letter that young women \"make it their business to paint or patch their faces, to curl their locks, and to find out the newest and costliest fashions.\" And with that, he was just getting started. Hale followed with a 160-word sentence that is a marvel in its depth of disdain.\n\nRead More\n\n\"If they rise in the morning before ten of the clock, the morning is spent between the comb, and the glass, and the box of patches; though they know not how to make provision for it themselves, they must have choice diet provided for them, and when they are ready, the next business is to come down, and sit in a rubbed parlour till dinner come in; and, after dinner, either to cards, or to the exchange, or to the play, or to Hyde Park, or to an impertinent visit; and after supper, either to a ball or to cards; and at this rate they spend their time, from one end of the year to the other; and at the same rate they spend their parent's or husband's money or estates in costly clothes, new fashions, chargeable entertainments: their home is their prison, and they are never at rest in it, unless they have gallants and splendid company to entertain.\"\n\nSome observers have been taken aback that Alito referenced Hale. But not everyone was surprised. Eileen Hunt, a Notre Dame political science professor who has written extensively about Mary Wollstonecraft, author of the path-breaking 1792 treatise \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\" tweeted :\n\n\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a conservative Supreme Court justice will cherry-pick an Enlightenment-era man as a timeless authority on reproductive rights but ignore #Wollstonecraft's pivotal philosophical views on women, mothering, and the sexual double standard.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nKen Armstrong was a reporter at ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Maternal Deaths Are Expected to Rise Under Abortion Bans, but the Increase May Be Hard to Measure\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, doctors have warned that limiting abortion care will make pregnancy more dangerous in a country that already has the highest maternal mortality rate among industrialized nations.\n\nThe case of Mylissa Farmer, a Missouri woman, is one example. Last August, her water broke less than 18 weeks into her pregnancy, when her fetus was not viable. She was at risk for developing a life-threatening infection if she continued the pregnancy. Yet during three separate visits to emergency rooms, she was denied abortion care because her fetus still had a heartbeat. Doctors specifically cited the state's new abortion law in her medical records and said they could not intervene until her condition worsened. She eventually traveled to Illinois for care.\n\nEven for people who don't develop sudden life-threatening complications, doctors note that carrying a pregnancy to term is inherently risky because rapid physical and hormonal changes can exacerbate chronic health conditions and trigger new complications. If more people are forced to continue unwanted pregnancies, there are bound to be more pregnancy-related deaths: A study by the University of Colorado estimates a 24% increase in maternal deaths if the United States bans abortion federally. They predicted the increase would be even higher for Black patients, at 39%. Currently, 14 states have total abortion bans.\n\nAdditionally, when abortion is illegal, it makes the procedure more dangerous for those who still try to terminate their pregnancies. The World Health Organization found that unsafe or illegal abortions account for up to 10% of maternal deaths worldwide .\n\nAs the United States enters its second post-Roe year, advocates say it's important to gather data on the impact abortion bans are having on the health of pregnant people to help both policy makers and voters understand the life-or-death consequences of the restrictions. Without such accounting, they say, the public may remain ignorant of the toll. Maternal mortality rates would be a crucial gauge of impact.\n\nDespite the stakes, experts say, at least in the short term, it may be difficult or impossible to track the number of lives lost due to limits on abortion access.\n\nProPublica spoke to four members of state maternal mortality review committees. Here are some of the challenges they see to drawing any clear conclusions from maternal mortality data in the near future.\n\nEach state has its own system for compiling the data maternal mortality researchers work with. The quality of the data varies vastly by state. It can involve comparing birth and fetal death records, scanning through obituaries, and sometimes begging coroner's offices to send death records. Many states are still working toward a complete system.\n\n\"It really depends on the rigor of the contributing entities,\" said Dr. Michelle Owens, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and the clinical chair for Mississippi's maternal mortality review committee. \"We rely so heavily upon the information we glean from these sources, and if that information is not as reliable ... it will definitely have a negative impact on our work and understanding of what the contributing things may have been and what the gaps are.\"\n\nAll the maternal mortality experts that ProPublica spoke with noted issues with the \"pregnancy check box\" used in death certificates to denote whether a patient was pregnant at the time of death or within the previous year. In Florida, Dr. Karen Harris, an OB-GYN and a member of Florida's maternal mortality review committee, has observed the check box \"overselect some patients who were never pregnant, or not pregnant in the last year, and it underselects patients who were pregnant.\"\n\nSometimes the check box is wrong because of clerical errors, the researchers said. Other times, it's simply not filled out because no autopsy was performed to verify whether the person was pregnant. That information could be important in measuring deaths that happen early in pregnancy - including murders. Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant or recently pregnant Americans, and researchers also would like to measure how abortion bans, which could force people in abusive relationships to carry unwanted pregnancies, affect those numbers.\n\nStudying pregnancy-associated deaths within a year of pregnancy helps researchers account for any additional factors like substance abuse, unstable housing, suicide or mental health problems. These could be important in identifying deaths connected to continuing an undesired pregnancy.\n\nThe data can also be slow - some states, like Florida, provide data to the committee for the past year right away. But others are years behind. Currently, many states have only released data through 2019.\n\nOne of the thorniest questions facing maternal mortality experts: How can they determine if abortion access was a factor?\n\nDr. Lynlee Wolfe, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and a member of the state's maternal mortality review committee, wishes maternal mortality review reports could include a check box for the question, \"Did inability to get an abortion play a role?\"\n\n\"But you often can't dig that out of notes,\" she said. \"I think what we're asking is kind of an untrackable number.\"\n\nThe experts said they could look into causes of death that may be linked to a patient's inability to get an abortion when they're having an emergency pregnancy complication: Sepsis, hemorrhage and heart issues, for example, are all worth studying to see if medical records might indicate if doctors delayed ending the pregnancy because the fetus still had a heartbeat.\n\nBut beyond that, when the pregnancy was unwanted or exacerbated broader health concerns, it could prove very difficult to determine if abortion access was a factor in the patient's decision-making.\n\nFor example, if a patient had a heart condition that carried a 50% chance of death in pregnancy, researchers would like to see whether the patient was counseled about the risk and offered a termination.\n\nBut in a state that had criminalized abortion, \"no one's going to write that down,\" said Harris, the Florida doctor. \"So we won't be able to know in the in-depth review if this was a patient choice - or if it was something that was forced upon her.\"\n\nResearchers might be able to learn more about the patient's state of mind and whether the pregnancy was desired or not from interviews with family members and social service records, Owens, the Mississippi doctor, said. But there's no guarantee they would have discussed their feelings about the pregnancy with family members either.\n\n\"With stigma and controversy surrounding conversations and considerations around abortions, people are hesitant to share those thoughts and feelings outside a very small circle of trust,\" she said.\n\nMaternal mortality review committees are funded by their states, and some are overseen by state legislatures.\n\nThe maternal mortality review members ProPublica spoke with said they did not anticipate interference with their report findings, even if they found examples where abortion access was a factor in a maternal death.\n\nBut some maternal care advocates worry such committees are vulnerable to political interference and manipulation. Last year, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced it was delaying its 2019 maternal mortality review report, originally scheduled for September 2022, until mid 2023.\n\nSome saw the delay as a way to keep negative numbers out of the public eye during election season and postpone their release until after the 2023 legislative session had ended. A member of the review committee said she believed there was no legitimate need for the delay and that it was \"dishonorably burying these women.\" ProPublica reached out to the committee and the Texas health agency to ask about these concerns, but did not receive any response.\n\nAfter pushback, the report was partially released in December 2022. It found persistent disparities affecting Black mothers and showed that the childbirth complication rate had risen 28% since 2018.\n\nIn July, Idaho disbanded its maternal mortality review committee , making it the only state without one. Lawmakers cited the costs of operating the committee - though members said operating costs were about $15,000 a year and covered by a federal grant. The decision came after a lobbying group argued that the committee was a \"vehicle to promote more government intervention in health care\" and opposed its recommendation to extend Medicaid coverage to mothers for 12 months postpartum.\n\nMaternal mortality rates in the U.S. are higher than in other wealthy countries and have been rising in recent years, so many resources are devoted to studying root causes of the trend and possible strategies for reversing it. But the actual number of deaths is statistically small: In 2021, the U.S. saw an estimated 32.9 deaths per 100,000 births, or 1,205 total pregnancy-related deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\nThis makes it difficult to draw conclusions that are rigorous by epidemiological standards, said Dr. Elliot Main, a Stanford professor and the former medical director for the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative.\n\nWhile researchers may learn of individual cases where it's clear that abortion access was an issue in the patient's outcome, it could take years to have a data set large enough to reveal a clear picture.\n\nMain also pointed out that many other factors influence maternal mortality rates, which muddles the picture. \"Maternal deaths are so rare and often complicated in their underlying causes,\" he said. \"If you see a trend over time, we have to break it down to see what's really causing that.\"\n\nBefore the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization struck down federal protections for abortion rights, U.S. maternal mortality rates were already rising. Influences include COVID-19, the opioid crisis and people having children at older ages, when they are at higher risk for complications. The U.S. also has long-standing racial and socioeconomic health care disparities affecting quality prenatal care - more than half of Georgia's counties have no OB-GYN , for example. That can mean more patients go into pregnancy with undiagnosed health conditions and may be at higher risk for life-threatening complications.\n\nMain and other researchers suggested that studying data on childbirth complications may provide more avenues for understanding the effects of abortion bans, because those are more common and would provide a larger data set to study.\n\nOne reason the impact of Dobbs on maternal mortality rates could remain limited even in states that have banned abortion is that some people who want to terminate their pregnancy are still able to do so, either by traveling or by ordering abortion medication in the mail.\n\nRead More\n\nIt's impossible to know the full picture of how many are able to jump through the hoops and obtain abortions even when there are no legal options nearby. But WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning that has been collecting data from abortion providers, estimates that in the six months following Dobbs, about 35,000 people in abortion-ban states were able to get abortions in other states - just over half of the people estimated to have sought abortions in those states, based on numbers from the same time period the previous year. It's unclear what happened to the other half. Some may have continued their pregnancies, others may have ordered abortion pills in the mail, which could be sent by organizations based in Europe and Mexico and not be recorded in any database.\n\nStill, having to travel out of state to a limited number of abortion providers meant more patients were forced to wait until their second trimester, researchers said, when an abortion can be more complicated.\n\nAnd while abortion pills are considered an exceedingly safe method of terminating a pregnancy through the first 10 weeks, according to the Food and Drug Administration and leading medical organizations, patients should still have the option to take them with the instruction and care of a medical provider, advocates say.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI have been reporting on changes to reproductive health care access since Roe v.

      "text": "ProPublica\n\nI n 2005, the Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy held a conference in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. The school's name was something of a misnomer: Rather than grant JDs, Witherspoon staged seminars and lectures offering lessons in what it summarized as \"the comprehensive biblical foundation for our common law and constitutional government.\" Its target audience was homeschooled young men . The school itself was a project of Vision Forum , a Texas-based ministry whose founder was also a leader in the Christian Patriarchy movement, which preaches, among other things, that husbands should vote for their wives.\n\nWhere it came from and where it stands today.\n\nMost sitting judges would go to great pains to avoid such a gathering. But Tom Parker , then a few months into his first term on the Alabama Supreme Court, gladly accepted an invitation to speak at that year's Witherspoon retreat. Before his election to Alabama's highest court, Parker had been an aide-de-camp to Chief Justice Roy Moore , whose installation of a granite Ten Commandments monument in the state judiciary building had touched off what became for Alabama both a considerable embarrassment and a genuine constitutional crisis. At Parker's swearing-in, he made it clear that he had sought the bench to continue his old boss's spiritual fight.\n\n\"The very God of Holy Scriptures, the Creator, is the source of law, life, and liberty,\" he declared to an audience that included his eight unsmiling fellow justices.\n\nThe atmosphere at Parker's Witherspoon appearance was far warmer, and his remarks there were even more candid. A DVD of the session shows him gripping the lectern, dressed in a gray suit and blue tie, as he railed against the perceived sins of jurists at every level. \"It's the judges who have legalized abortion and homosexuality ... They are shaking the very foundation of our society.\" Parker made it clear that he had no intention of letting legal precedent get in his way. \"We cannot fall under that trap,\" he insisted. \"We have to stand for what's right.\" The one thing he most wished for the young men before him was that they find a way to gain positions of influence and turn them to God's purpose. No opportunity to do so should be shrunk from or wasted.\n\nIn the nine years Parker has now served on the court, he has made the most of his opportunities. Child custody disputes , for instance, have made good occasions to expound on the role of religion in parental rights. (\"Because God, not the state, has granted parents the authority and responsibility to govern their children, parents should be able to do so unfettered by state interference,\" he wrote in one case .) But Parker has been the most creative in his relentless campaign to undermine legal abortion. Again and again, he has taken cases that do not directly concern reproductive rights, or even reproductive issues, and found ways to use them to argue for full legal status for the unborn.\n\nThose efforts have made Parker a pivotal figure in the so-called personhood movement, which has its roots in a loophole in Roe v. Wade . While that 1973 ruling was creating a broad new right to abortion grounded in a constitutionally protected right to privacy, an often-overlooked passage left an opening for those who would seek its undoing. During oral arguments , the justices had asked Roe's lawyer what would happen if a fetus were held to be a person under the Constitution. \"I would have a very difficult case,\" she had replied. In his majority opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun noted that the Supreme Court could find no basis for such status, before adding, \"If this suggestion of personhood is established, [Roe's] case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed.\"\n\nRoe 's fiercest critics immediately took up the challenge, launching a push for a constitutional amendment affirming that life begins at conception. But that first effort fizzled, and it's only in recent years that a new wave of pro-life activists -many of them born after Roe and educated in fundamentalist Christian settings-have once again seized on personhood as a way not just of weakening Roe, but of overturning it. In state after state, they have been pushing to have their beliefs enshrined in policy. This November 4, in Colorado, voters will cast ballots on Amendment 67 , an initiative that would include unborn human beings under the definition of \"person\" and \"child\" throughout the state's criminal code. North Dakotans, meanwhile, will decide on Measure 1 , which would alter the state constitution to recognize the \"inalienable right to life\" at every stage of human development.\n\nEven if both initiatives fall short, others will follow. The first one to pass doubtlessly will then be challenged in court, igniting the potentially decisive battle that personhood advocates really want. Their goal is to get to the U.S. Supreme Court - as quickly as possible, while conservatives still dominate.\n\nChristian-educated lawyers have been preparing for that day, churning out articles published by Christian law journals, which are then cited in briefs submitted to courts by Christian-right legal organizations. But given their provenance, the impact of those arguments has been limited. Parker, a graduate of Dartmouth and Vanderbilt who counts Clarence Thomas as a role model, has the imprimatur of his office behind him, and he has used it to build a body of reasoning that can be cited and re-cited, helping to frame and refine the thinking of other lawyers and judges in the battles ahead. \"Now, it's not just an obscure law-review article making these arguments,\" said Glen Halva-Neubauer , a Furman University political scientist who studies anti-abortion activism. \"It's not just some treatise that twenty-five of your right-to-life friends know about and nobody else. The mainstream effect is not inconsequential.\"\n\nAnd that, of course, was the idea all along. \"What Justice Parker has done,\" said Lynn Paltrow , executive director of the nonprofit National Advocates for Pregnant Women , \"is explicitly lay out the roadmap for overturning Roe v. Wade .\"\n\nT he Human Life Amendment, as personhood advocates' first big push was commonly known, was ahead of its time. In the wake of Roe , pro-choice groups - which then included many centrist Republicans - had the momentum. Personhood proponents hoped in vain that Ronald Reagan's election and the GOP's capture of the Senate in 1980 would turn the tide, but the comparatively moderate pro-life mainstream wasn't fully on board. By the time the Supreme Court reaffirmed a core right to abortion in the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the movement had shifted to its own incremental approach. Targeting legislatures in conservative states, it sought tougher penalties for fetal homicides, and, later, birth certificates for stillborn babies. The revised approach alarmed abortion-rights advocates because it was so emotionally resonant - and effective.\n\nThe basic holding of Roe obviously remains in place, and more than one million legal abortions are performed in the United States every year. Yet the personhood movement has made significant inroads. Today, 38 states have fetal-homicide statutes that make it a crime to cause the death of an unborn child during an act of domestic violence, for example, or while driving drunk. At least 15 have laws that make the pregnancy of a homicide victim an aggravating factor that can lead to the death penalty. And more and more jurisdictions have begun policing pregnant women themselves. In almost every state, women have been arrested or detained for exposing their fetuses to illegal drugs; in more than half of them, mothers can lose some or even all of their custody rights if they or their newborn tests positive for controlled substances. In some places, legislators have written laws expressly authorizing such steps. (Tennessee's new statute goes the furthest, allowing pregnant drug-users to be charged with criminal assault.) More commonly, it's constables and prosecutors who've taken the initiative, reinterpreting existing laws to detain and arrest mothers. \"One clever thing about using drug cases this way,\" said Sara Zeigler , a feminist scholar and dean at Eastern Kentucky University, \"is that the average person is not going to be at all sympathetic\" to a pregnant woman who gets high. Thanks to moves such as these, the idea that a fetus has rights separate from its mother's has taken root in the law and flourished, even when the more controversial subject of fetal personhood is not directly invoked.\n\nIn sum, although, as the petitioners correctly state, a majority of jurisdictions have held that unborn children are not afforded protection from the use of a controlled substance by their mothers, they nonetheless fail to convince this Court that the decisions of those courts are persuasive and should be followed by this Court.\n\nA big reason that these piecemeal personhood triumphs haven't translated into something more sweeping is because courts haven't been willing to explicitly take up the issue. \"If you are a careful, strict constructionist kind of judge, you don't necessarily connect the dots,\" Halva-Neubauer said. Parker not only connects the dots, \"he uses a rocket launcher to go after these cases and say, 'Hey, this is a case that could be used to overrule Roe , and I'm going to show you how.'\" In 2011, for example, Parker and his fellow justices heard a case involving a wrongful death lawsuit brought by a woman who blamed her miscarriage on the negligence of her doctors. Under Alabama precedent, such suits weren't allowed unless the fetus had developed to the point where it could survive outside the womb. But in Hamilton v. Scott , the court voted to strike down that limit. Parker wrote the majority opinion.\n\nThen he wrote some more. As a judge, Parker has developed the decidedly unusual habit of authoring concurring opinions to his own majority rulings in cases that hold particular interest for him. In his concurrence to Hamilton , he cited advances in medical and scientific technology as part of a larger, painstaking argument asserting that a centerpiece of Roe - that states cannot ban abortion before the point of viability - was \"arbitrary,\" \"incoherent,\" and \"mostly unsupported by legal precedent.\"\n\nZeigler marvels at how Parker has used the concurrence to strategic effect. \"It's like he's writing a law-review article without having to go through that process, plus he gets a much wider audience,\" she said. And unlike a dissent, a concurrence conveys a certain legitimacy - the idea that the author is on the winning side. \"It is much likelier to be noticed and captured and repeated in future cases.\"\n\nM ontgomery, the city where Parker was raised and where the Alabama Supreme Court sits, wears its faith on its sleeve - and its t-shirts, and its restaurant menus, and its license plates. Crosses are more ubiquitous than the American flag. Every other block seems to have a church, sometimes two or three of them. The Frazer United Methodist Church, where Parker worships, is particularly modern and prosperous looking, with a TV station and a playground inside the main lobby. When you park in the immense lot - the church claims a congregation of 8,000 - you remember where you left your car not by the usual Section A, B or C but by one of the virtues: Love, Self-Control, Patience.\n\nOver the decades, as Parker has learned to seize his opportunities, he has also learned the value of self-control and patience. \"We have to rely on the Holy Spirit so that we don't rush out into a battle that God did not call us to,\" he told a roomful of admirers at the Witherspoon conference in 2005. \"With youthful zeal I wanted to get involved in so many fights. But it was so important for me to remember this truth: that the existence of the need is not evidence of the call.\"\n\nParker's own calling wasn't clear for many years. He was born to a middle-class Montgomery family in 1952, at the dawn of the modern civil rights era, a few miles from the bus stops and churches where it all began. At a time when many white families were fleeing to segregated Christian academies, he attended the city's public schools. (His senior year, he was student body president and, according to his classmates, \"Most Sincere.\") At Dartmouth, he thought he might become a historian, but ultimately chose law school instead.\n\nWhat he found at Vanderbilt Law School in the mid-1970s shocked him. The religious roots of American law were a forbidden topic. There were no classes specifically devoted to the founding document of American jurisprudence, he said.\n\n\"They teach you about what judges say about the Constitution rather than having you go back and study the Constitution,\" he told a gathering last year .\n\nAs a young lawyer, Parker led fights to restore God to everyday life in the state - particularly in its schools and textbooks . But he often wound up frustrated, never more so than when a landmark school prayer case he worked on went down to defeat before the U.S. Supreme Court. He complained that the court's 1985 decision in Wallace v. Jaffree was \"the greatest setback to religious liberty that has ever occurred in this country.\"\n\nAfter a stint as a lobbyist, during which he helped establish two think tanks affiliated with James Dobson's hugely influential Focus on the Family, Parker became a confidant of Roy Moore, then a county judge. When Moore became chief justice of the state Supreme Court in 2000, Parker served as his legal lieutenant, strategist and spokesman. And when Moore's final Ten Commandments crusade ended in debacle, Parker was ousted, too.\n\nIf unemployed, Parker was hardly finished. He went to work at Moore's Foundation for Moral Law , a think tank devoted \"to protect[ing] the Constitution and protect[ing] the heritage of our Country.\" It promoted the far-right strain of Christianity known as Reconstructionism - supporters believe that the Bible should be the governing text for all areas of civil and political life; that America's Christian founders intended it to be a Christian land; that there is no law without God; that the law and the Constitution don't evolve any more than humans do, but are fixed and immutable. The Foundation was also a champion of the newly revived personhood movement - indeed, it claimed the group Personhood Alabama as one of its projects.\n\nParker won a spot on the state's top court in 2004. Once elected, he freely recruited the kinds of committed, somewhat eclectic culture combatants who made up Moore's circle. For the powerful behind-the-scenes job of chief of staff, he chose John Eidsmoe , an ex-law professor and author of several seminal Reconstructionist works - \"the top Biblical law commander of the era,\" according to Frederick Clarkson , a journalist and historian of far-right religious movements and senior fellow at Political Research Associates.\n\nTwo of Parker's quirkiest hires were Alex and Brett Harris , 16-year-old homeschooled twins from outside Portland, Ore., whose blog, Rebelution (tagline: \"a teenage rebellion against low expectations\") had made them the Jonas Brothers of the Christian homeschool world. After they blogged about one of his opinions, Parker took them on for a two-month legal internship; despite their lack of training, they quickly progressed from filing memos to researching and drafting legal opinions. A few months after that, in 2006, Parker made them the grassroots directors in his (failed) campaign to become chief justice. \"They demonstrated a maturity comparable to the law students we've had, and sometimes exceeding that maturity,\" Parker raved .\n\nParker soon gained a kind of celebrity in the world of Christian talk radio. He appeared at conferences and conventions and had little compunction about voicing his opinions in public forums. \"The liberals on the U.S. Supreme Court already look down on the pro-family policies, Southern heritage, evangelical Christianity and other blessings of our great state,\" Parker declared in one particularly blistering op-ed , in which he excoriated his fellow justices for following that court's precedent and overturning the death penalty for a man convicted of murder as a juvenile. \"We Alabamians will never be able to sufficiently appease such establishment liberals, so we should stop trying and instead stand up for what we believe without apology... It does no good to possess conservative credentials if you surrender them before joining the battle.\"\n\nParker didn't expect those battles to be easy. But knew that judges had strategic weapons at their disposal that could alter the course of the fight in the long term. Dissents and concurrences, for example, might not have the force of precedent, but they could signal new tactics, raise new arguments - and eventually change minds.\n\nParker liked to invoke scripture when referring to judges as \"gods with little g's.\"\n\n\"When judges don't rule in the fear of the Lord, everything's falling apart,\" he would argue , citing the Book of Psalms. \"The whole world is coming unglued.\"\n\nI n 2013, a case landed on the Alabama Supreme Court docket that presented Parker with yet another opportunity to attack Roe v. Wade . One of the plaintiffs, Hope Ankrom, from Coffee County south of Montgomery, had pleaded guilty after her son tested positive for cocaine and marijuana at birth. The other, Amanda Kimbrough, from rural northwestern Alabama, had used methamphetamine while pregnant, giving birth 15 weeks prematurely to a boy who soon died. Facing the possibility of life in prison, she opted for a plea deal and a 10 year sentence in the notorious Tutwiler state penitentiary for women. But no Alabama laws specifically authorized the women's arrests and convictions. Instead, prosecutors had charged them under a felony \"chemical endangerment\" statute enacted in 2006 to protect children from the noxious fumes and explosive chemicals that make home-based meth labs so dangerous.\n\nLawyers for Ankrom and Kimbrough argued that the state had grossly overreached, pointing out that legislators had debated - and rejected - expanding the meth-lab law to cover pregnant women. Parker, along with five other justices, didn't buy it. He declared that the chemical-endangerment law did indeed apply to fetuses exposed to drugs in the womb. But again, Parker didn't leave it at that. His main opinion in Ex Parte Ankron and Kimbrough ran 55 pages. His concurrence ran another 20.\n\nThis time, Parker's goal was to establish the many ways that existing statutes recognize fetuses as persons with legally enforceable rights. The document is a kind of masterpiece of pro-life reasoning. \"He's someone who really takes time to read history and the development of jurisprudence,\" said Mat Staver , the head of Liberty Counsel and a leading Christian legal theorist. \"He's not a surface thinker.\" Step by step, Parker lays out his evidence: laws that give inheritance rights to unborn children, laws that ban pregnant inmates from being executed, laws that give fetuses legal guardians for the purposes of protecting their interests, laws that allow parents to sue for damages if fetuses are injured or killed as the result of negligence or some other wrongful act. Several pages of the concurrence consist almost entirely of lists of statutes from around the country conferring fetal rights. \"Today, the only major area in which unborn children are denied legal protection is abortion,\" he concluded, \"and that denial is only because of the dictates of Roe .\"\n\nThis past spring, as if to punctuate its reasoning, the Alabama Supreme Court confronted a virtually identical case , and, with Parker again writing the majority opinion, reached a virtually identical conclusion. In this concurrence, Parker called on the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the matter of full fetal rights once and for all.\n\nThe Court will soon have its chances, if it wants to take them. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit just upheld a set of abortion regulations in Texas that have shut down most of that state's abortion clinics, the appeal of which the justices could well agree to hear. Meanwhile, the National Advocates for Pregnant Women is putting together a lawsuit that would challenge Alabama's chemical-endangerment prosecutions, which now number at least 130. Going to the Supreme Court on any issue that touches on abortion feels increasingly risky for pro-choice supporters. Anthony Kennedy remains the swing vote, and, on the one hand, he has argued that people must be allowed \"to define one's own concept of existence. \" On the other, he has upheld almost every abortion restriction to come before him. Staver is hopeful that Kennedy's concern for \" the dignity of the individual ,\" a recent theme of his ever-unpredictable reasoning, may make him newly amenable to overturning Roe on personhood grounds.\n\nPro-choice advocates, not surprisingly, are deeply worried about any ideas that Parker's writings could give the justices in Washington. \"Parker is pointing out all the ways the law treats the fetus as a person already,\" Zeigler, the feminist scholar, said. \"The pro-choice argument, meanwhile, is that the personhood of the fetus hinges entirely on the women's perception of it.\" To the question of what constitutes life, she continued, \"Parker has answers. The pro-choice side is more, 'It depends.' ... People will really struggle with that.\"\n\nThis story was co-published with The New Republic .

      "text": "\"This Was Not a Surprise\": How the Pro-Choice Movement Lost the Battle for Roe\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAs all eyes were on the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday after a leaked draft majority opinion indicated it is planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, ProPublica spoke with journalist Joshua Prager, who spent 11 years dissecting the landmark case that guaranteed abortion rights for women across the country. For his acclaimed book \" The Family Roe: An American Story ,\" Prager interviewed upwards of 500 people including key figures on both sides of the case, most notably its plaintiff, Norma McCorvey, who was better known as Jane Roe. In delving into the untold story behind her life, those of the children she gave birth to and the monumental case, Prager unfurled the decadeslong history of the American war over abortion.\n\nPrager said indicators of the justices' leanings were clear while observing arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , a case challenging a 2018 Mississippi law prohibiting most abortions after 15 weeks' gestational age, which is the subject of the Supreme Court's draft opinion. Though the Court confirmed the authenticity of the document published this week by Politico, the final vote and decision are still pending. Prager discussed why he believed the road to this week's revelation was paved, in part, by decades of mistakes and missed opportunities made by the pro-choice movement. (In his book, Prager refers to those who support the right to abortion the way they refer to themselves, \"pro-choice,\" and those opposing abortion the way they refer to themselves, \"pro-life.\" We adhered to these conventions during our interview. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.)\n\nI absolutely did. Anyone who was a close follower of the issue could see that this was happening when we listened to the oral arguments in Dobbs. We knew where all of the justices stood pretty much, but there were two who we thought might go either way, Justice (Amy Coney) Barrett, Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh - two of Trump's three appointments. And to listen to them speak and question during oral arguments in Dobbs, we could see where they were going.\n\nKavanaugh, over and again, was speaking about precedents that the Supreme Court had previously overturned. Justice Barrett, meantime, was speaking about the fact that adoption is, as she put it, a viable alternative to abortion.\n\nWhat was so fascinating about this and tragic, if you're a person who believes that Roe ought not to be overturned, was that the Supreme Court did not need Justice (John) Roberts, the chief justice anymore; the conservative bloc now doesn't need him. They have the votes that they need 5 to 4 without him. He is an incrementalist. He is a person who respects precedent. He really cares about the image of the court, does not want it to be seen as simply a political body. And he was desperate to not actually have the headline that we had last night. He wanted to see Roe maintained, but sort of gutted. But he lost.\n\nSo this was not a surprise. If you step back further, when Roe was ruled upon in 1973 , it galvanized those opposed to it. And it gave (the pro-life movement) a very simple, clear target, a new raison d'etre: We want to overturn Roe. This is the culmination of 49 1/2 years of efforts and different approaches, novel approaches. And unfortunately, again, if you are a person who believes in reproductive choice, the pro-choice did not take a lot of that seriously for many years, and they are as much to, sort of, blame for this day as the pro-life will (take) credit for.\n\n(The pro-choice movement) did not foresee a war here. NARAL's executive director in 1973, when Roe was ruled upon, told her board after the ruling, \"The court has spoken and the case is closed.\" They saw this as, basically: It's over. We've won.\n\nThe very, very opposite is true of the pro-life, who said: OK, now we have to think about this strategically, how will we go about overturning Roe? As a result of that imbalance, the pro-choice were playing catch up really for 49 1/2 years, as the pro-life (movement has) over and over again come up with many different ways to chip away at Roe and has been remarkably successful. Just to give you a few examples:\n\nThe pro-life also used technology in a way that had never been used before by showing fetal photography. They used language that had never been used before, for example, coining the phrase \"partial-birth abortion.\"\n\nThey also used pseudoscience in a remarkable way. They came up with this very novel approach called \"post-abortion syndrome,\" saying that if a woman had an abortion, an enormous percentage of the time, she would suffer psychologically as a result of that. That's not true. In fact, the opposite is true. The majority of women who have abortions express relief as opposed to regret. If there is something that causes women grief, the studies show, it is relinquishing their child to adoption. These were all pro-life weapons in attacking Roe, and over and over again, you had the pro-choice movement outfoxed.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the early 2000s, one of the attacks on Roe was led by lawyer Allan Parker, who had represented Norma for a time. (The suit) said that Roe needed to become null and void because conditions had changed in the years since it had been filed. And the only way to file this suit was to have the original plaintiff file it. So he came to represent Norma and he filed this suit.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that the pro-choice basically ignored the suit. They said that it was a sad publicity stunt, and they did not file a single brief defending Roe in this case. And it ended up introducing into the judicial system these affidavits filed by women who said that abortion harmed them. And that idea ended up going right up to the Supreme Court. Justice (Anthony) Kennedy ended up citing them in 2007 in Gonzales v. Carhart. It was evident that Parker's lawsuit had been incredibly effective and powerful.\n\nIt shows all of the different ways in which the pro-choice have failed to meet the pro-life, have failed to repel their arguments and their strategies. And it speaks to a simple human reality that it's much easier to try to knock something down than to defend it. What we're going to see now is the very same problem that the pro-choice had, the pro-life now are going to have, because now you are going to see that this is going to galvanize the tens of millions of people who are horrified about what's happening now. They now will have as simple a marching order as the pro-life used to have to reinstate Roe or to come up with another way to ensure that abortion will be legal for women across the country.\n\nRoe was 1 day old in 1973 when Bella Abzug, who was a House representative from New York, urged Congress to codify Roe. She basically foresaw exactly where we are today, that there was the potential legislation to erode Roe. She introduced an act: The Abortion Rights Act, H.R. 254 , to bar states from creating new (laws) on abortion. Congress ignored her bill, and anyway, it was doomed to failure because Roe allowed for future legislation. It gave states the right to oppose regulations from the second trimester onward, but here we are now and people want to go back and do exactly what Bella Abzug was saying that we ought to do.\n\nIt's not only true, but something that, case in point, was embodied by Justice (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg's decision to not step down from the court in her 80s, during Obama's presidency. We would not be here had she done that. That is a simple fact. And that is a very painful fact, for she's obviously the greatest hero over the course of 50 years to the pro-choice movement, but whether it was hubris or it was an inability to see that Trump might be elected or just a very human, understandable desire to hold onto a job she loved, it was nonetheless a mistake with catastrophic consequences. And that, you can say, was the final nail in the coffin for Roe, but it was also the latest in a long line of missteps by the pro-choice of failing to properly address the situation in which they found themselves.\n\nAnd here we are, but again, it's now going to flip. If you're a person who cares about choice, that is the silver lining of this very dark, dark cloud that it is now going to galvanize in a way we have not seen in our lifetimes, those who believe in a right to choose.\n\nFiled under -\n\nAs a deputy managing editor, I lead teams of reporters and editors.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Our reporters take you inside ProPublica's reproductive health coverage\n\nNov 21, 2024\n\n4:00 pm EST\n\nVirtual Event\n\nOver the last two years, ProPublica has been diligently tracking the consequences of state abortion bans that have come into effect in nearly half the country after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. We found that women in serious danger have been forced to continue high-risk pregnancies that threatened their lives and have been turned away from emergency rooms because of abortion bans. We've written about hospital abortion committees that have to make high-stakes decisions for patients with health risks. In interviews with more than three dozen OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion, we learned how difficult it is to interpret the vague and conflicting language in bans' medical exceptions - especially, the doctors said, when questions about their judgment can come with the threat of prison time. Yet even when some Republican lawmakers have said they regretted passing the bans and tried to make small changes , they have run up against anti-abortion lobbyists who want to keep the laws exactly as strict as they are . In September, ProPublica uncovered two cases of women in Georgia who died after they couldn't access timely medical care under the state's abortion ban. And in October, we reported that two pregnant Texas women died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages . There are almost certainly other cases that raise questions about the harm caused by state abortion bans.\n\nOur investigations into the deaths of Amber Thurman , Candi Miller , Josseli Barnica and Nevaeh Crain highlight how health care for pregnant patients has changed in states like Texas and Georgia that banned abortion, and how that can lead to deaths that experts deem preventable.\n\nThis virtual Q&A with reporters Kavitha Surana, Cassandra Jaramillo and Lizzie Presser, and with deputy managing editor Alexandra Zayas, will offer an inside look at ProPublica's reproductive health coverage and our \" Post-Roe America \" series, reporting on the tremendous upheaval caused by laws that restrict abortion access across the nation.\n\nSubmit your question when you RSVP.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nThis event has ended.\n\n© Copyright 2025 Pro Publica Inc."

      "text": "Afraid to Seek Care Amid Georgia's Abortion Ban, She Stayed at Home and Died\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nCandi Miller's health was so fragile, doctors warned having another baby could kill her.\n\n\"They said it was going to be more painful and her body may not be able to withstand it,\" her sister, Turiya Tomlin-Randall, told ProPublica.\n\nBut when the mother of three realized she had unintentionally gotten pregnant in the fall of 2022, Georgia's new abortion ban gave her no choice. Although it made exceptions for acute, life-threatening emergencies, it didn't account for chronic conditions, even those known to present lethal risks later in pregnancy.\n\nWhy should I trust your reporting?\n\nI ( Kavitha Surana ) am a reporter who has been covering reproductive health care access since Roe v. Wade was overturned. I've spoken with doctors , community workers and patients across the country about how abortion bans have made pregnancy more dangerous in America, and I've written about the Republican lawmakers who refused to listen .\n\nIf you want to get in touch and learn more about how I work, email me . I take your privacy very seriously.\n\nLearn more about how ProPublica covers maternal health.\n\nAt 41, Miller had lupus, diabetes and hypertension and didn't want to wait until the situation became dire. So she avoided doctors and navigated an abortion on her own - a path many health experts feared would increase risks when women in America lost the constitutional right to obtain legal, medically supervised abortions.\n\nMiller ordered abortion pills online, but she did not expel all the fetal tissue and would need a dilation and curettage procedure to clear it from her uterus and stave off sepsis, a grave and painful infection. In many states, this care, known as a D&C, is routine for both abortions and miscarriages. In Georgia, performing it had recently been made a felony, with few exceptions.\n\nHer teenage son watched her suffer for days after she took the pills, bedridden and moaning. In the early hours of Nov. 12, 2022, her husband found her unresponsive in bed, her 3-year-old daughter at her side.\n\nAn autopsy found unexpelled fetal tissue, confirming that the abortion had not fully completed. It also found a lethal combination of painkillers, including the dangerous opioid fentanyl. Miller had no history of drug use, the medical records state; her family has no idea how she obtained them or what was going through her mind - whether she was trying to quell the pain, complete the abortion or end her life. A medical examiner was unable to determine the manner of death.\n\nHer family later told a coroner she hadn't visited a doctor \"due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions.\"\n\nWhen a state committee of experts in maternal health, including 10 doctors, reviewed her case this year at the end of August, they immediately decided it was \"preventable\" and blamed the state's abortion ban, according to members who spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThey came to that conclusion after weighing the entire chain of events, from Miller's underlying health conditions, to her decision to manage her abortion alone, to her reticence to seek medical care. \"The fact that she felt that she had to make these decisions, that she didn't have adequate choices here in Georgia, we felt that definitely influenced her case,\" one committee member told ProPublica. \"She's absolutely responding to this legislation.\"\n\nThis is the second preventable death related to abortion bans that ProPublica is reporting this week. Amber Thurman, 28, languished in a suburban Atlanta hospital for 20 hours before doctors performed a D&C to treat sepsis that resulted from an incomplete abortion. It was too late. \"This young mother should be alive, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said of Thurman on Tuesday. \"This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.\"\n\nThere are almost certainly other deaths related to abortion access. Georgia's committee, tasked with examining pregnancy-related deaths to improve maternal health, has only reviewed cases through fall 2022. Such a lag is common in these committees, which are set up in each state; most others have not even gotten that far.\n\nThe details of their reviews are not shared with the public, but ProPublica obtained the Georgia committee's summary report of Miller's death. ProPublica also reviewed death records and Miller's autopsy and spoke to her family.\n\nHer case adds to mounting evidence that exceptions to abortion bans do not, as billed, protect the \"life of the mother.\" Harrowing stories about denied care have been at the center of the upcoming presidential election, during which the right to abortion is on the ballot in 10 states. ProPublica's new reporting makes clear, for the first time, that in the wake of bans, women are losing their lives in ways that experts have deemed preventable.\n\nIt also underscores the reality that abortion bans have not actually led to a decrease in abortions. But for people like Miller, they have increased the degree of difficulty and risk.\n\nMiller grew up in Alabama and spent most of her adulthood in Atlanta, where she made a living braiding hair and doing nails. She had a soft spot for stray cats, nurtured a garden and was known to break into dance at the sound of old school funk like the Commodores. At 4 foot 9, she was a \"firecracker,\" her family said - quick to stand up for those she loved. That included her three kids, who range in age from 5 to 16.\n\nBut about eight years ago, she was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks healthy tissue, her sister said. Symptoms include extreme fatigue; painful, swollen joints; heart complications; and kidney disease.\n\nMiller experienced flare-ups of debilitating pain for which she had to seek radiation treatments. She often wasn't able to stand for long periods and her hair fell out. It distressed her how often doctors dismissed her pain; she grew to doubt they could give her help when she needed it.\n\nSoon after she was diagnosed, she suffered a major depressive episode, Tomlin-Randall said. For months, she barely left her bed. Tomlin-Randall cared for her sister's children during that time.\n\nThere is no cure for lupus, but patients can manage symptoms with a mixture of drugs and therapies; 90% of those afflicted are women, and the condition is three times more common in Black women than white.\n\nMiller also had diabetes and hypertension. Those conditions, layered on top of her lupus, can be dangerously exacerbated by pregnancy and are highly unpredictable, during both the pregnancy and the aftermath, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine . Patients with those conditions are also more likely to have a pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or premature birth and are more likely to need a cesarean section, a major surgery that is especially hard for patients with diabetes to recover from.\n\nWith support, some patients can remain stable and have healthy pregnancies, though the experience can be physically taxing and painful. In the worst cases, pregnancy with lupus can lead to high blood pressure that can quickly progress to seizures, kidney and liver dysfunction and, ultimately, death. Studies have found the maternal death rate for women with lupus is 20-fold higher than for those without lupus . The chance of relapses and flare-ups are also high in the postpartum period.\n\nEach patient's situation is different and needs careful evaluation of their particular health risks, including discussion of the option to end the pregnancy, said Dr. Sarah Horvath, an OB-GYN representing ACOG.\n\nPoliticians who support abortion bans often point to their exceptions, which they say protect \"the life of the mother.\" During last week's debate, former President Donald Trump called them \"very important.\"\n\nBut the anti-abortion groups that drafted the bans wrote the exceptions to be as narrow as possible and persuaded lawmakers to impose steep criminal penalties, fearing doctors might stretch definitions to create loopholes.\n\nThe exceptions are limited to acute emergencies, usually defined as when \"necessary in order to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.\" They also specifically prohibit mental health reasons from counting as health emergencies, even if a pregnant woman says she is thinking about harming herself. In Georgia, violating the law can cost doctors their license and subject them to prison terms of up to 10 years.\n\nThe laws typically don't include any leeway for intervening earlier to treat patients with broader health risks that could make pregnancy more dangerous, such as lupus.\n\nProPublica surveyed dozens of doctors in nine states with abortion bans. None of their hospitals approve abortions for women with high-risk complications like lupus or diabetes unless the patient is already deteriorating and the issue is urgent.\n\nHorvath regularly sees patients with complications from those conditions in Pennsylvania because they can't get care in their own state. Often, the delay in figuring out where to go means their pregnancy is further along - and, as a result, their conditions have become more dangerous. They show up to outpatient clinics already displaying signs of trouble, Horvath said, and immediately have to be sent to the hospital where there's an operating room and a blood bank.\n\nIt often takes time for patients and their providers to coordinate care in other states because there is so much confusion about the laws.\n\n\"People who are really suffering in these pregnancies really don't know where to go,\" Horvath said. \"Or if they even can.\"\n\nMiller's third pregnancy was difficult and she never fully recovered, Tomlin-Randall said.\n\nWhen Miller learned she was pregnant again in 2022, she ordered abortion pills for about $80 from a website called AidAccess, according to her 16-year-old son, Christian Cardenas.\n\nThe organization, based in the Netherlands, is devoted to expanding abortion access to places where it is not legal. Patients contact a doctor in Europe who sends them pills from a supplier in India. According to one researcher, Aid Access serves about 7,000 patients a month in the U.S., nearly 90% of them in states with abortion bans or severe restrictions. Its founder, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, said it was clear the abortion pill did not cause her death.\n\nThe committee also did not believe Miller's death was caused by the abortion medication. Her autopsy found extremely high doses of diphenhydramine (the main ingredient in Benadryl) and acetaminophen (what's found in Tylenol) in Miller's system, along with the fentanyl. Considering the quantity of drugs and the timing of her death, the committee also did not suspect the abortion pills themselves were in any way tainted.\n\nRead More\n\nSelf-managing abortions at home has skyrocketed since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, because of access to pills that can be ordered online, researchers say.\n\nMajor studies, the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization have found abortion pills to be more than 90% effective when taken correctly and in the first trimester. Deaths due to abortion pills are exceedingly rare. Complications can develop if some fetal tissue remains in the uterus, where it can lead to sepsis, a grave infection. Patients are supposed to follow up with a doctor to make sure the abortion has fully completed and go to the hospital if bleeding heavily or exhibiting other symptoms.\n\nMiller's family does not know how far along her pregnancy was when she took the abortion pills.\n\nBut soon enough, she was in excruciating pain.\n\nAnd that's how she remained, for days, until she took the potent drug mixture. Her family doesn't know what she was thinking when she did it, but can't fathom that she would want to end her life; she was excited about the future and drawing closer to her church, her sister Tomlin-Randall said.\n\n\"She was trying to terminate the pregnancy, not terminate herself,\" she said.\n\nIt was significant to the state maternal mortality review committee that Miller did not feel she could seek medical care.\n\nAlthough Georgia courts have said women can't be prosecuted for getting abortions, the state has sent mixed messages. While some state bans explicitly say women can't be prosecuted, Georgia's ban leaves open that possibility. In 2019, a district attorney on the outskirts of metro Atlanta called abortion \"murder\" and said women \"should prepare for the chance that they could be criminally prosecuted for having an abortion.\"\n\nThat was the understanding in Miller's family.\n\n\"If you get caught trying to do anything to get rid of the baby,\" her son Christian told ProPublica, \"you get jail time for that.\"\n\nCassandra Jaramillo contributed reporting.

      "text": "Are Abortion Bans Across America Causing Deaths? The States That Passed Them Are Doing Little to Find Out.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn states with abortion bans, ProPublica has found, pregnant women have bled to death, succumbed to fatal infections and wound up in morgues with what medical examiners recorded were \"products of conception\" still in their bodies.\n\nThese are the very kinds of cases state maternal mortality review committees are supposed to delve into, determining why they happened and how to stop them from happening again.\n\nBut panels in states that have recently imposed strict bans on abortion have done little to uncover whether the laws are contributing to maternal deaths, including tracking delays in care for pregnancy complications and making these problems known, a ProPublica investigation shows.\n\nIn fact, we found that in a few states, political leaders who backed the bans have stood in the way of measuring their consequences.\n\nThey have dismissed committees, slowing down their work. They have weeded out members openly critical of abortion bans and supportive of transparency.\n\nTexas has gone as far as to legally prohibit its committee from reviewing deaths that are considered abortion-related. This could include some miscarriage care, health officials told ProPublica.\n\nIn two deaths of Texas women that ProPublica investigated, Porsha Ngumezi and Josseli Barnica had already miscarried when they were given misoprostol to help complete the process. The committee does not review cases that involve that drug because it's also used for abortions, said committee chair Dr. Carla Ortique: \"If they received medication, if they received any procedure, we will not get those records.\" Chris Van Deusen, the spokesperson at the Texas Department of State Health Services, would not say whether Ngumezi's and Barnica's deaths would be reviewed.\n\nOther state committees have not made changes to systematically examine the role abortion bans are playing in maternal deaths, officials acknowledged, though some said they might note it as a contributing factor if it appears in the records. \"If the committee discovers a trend that raises a particular concern, it could decide to include that information in its reports,\" South Carolina officials said.\n\nSome noted that they follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that those recommendations don't direct committees to consider abortion access or delays in abortion care. Indiana's law directs committee members to determine whether the person who died had an abortion and whether that contributed to their death; it does not focus on delays in access to abortion care.\n\nStates can direct their committees to look at any important health issue; Texas' panel added new questions to its process to help capture the role of the coronavirus pandemic in deaths , for example.\n\nProPublica asked governors in 15 states with strict abortion bans whether committees should examine the impact of the laws on maternal deaths; most did not respond. None directly answered the question or advocated for specific changes. ( Read their responses here. )\n\n\"We're not acting like we want to know the answer to this question. And that concerns me,\" said Caitlin Myers, an economics researcher at Middlebury College who is studying the impact of abortion access on maternal health. \"However you feel about the ethics of abortion, we should want to understand how these policies are affecting women's health.\"\n\nExperts interviewed by ProPublica say state maternal mortality review committees are uniquely well-positioned to examine the impacts of abortion bans on maternal health. The panels are often made up of practicing OB-GYNs, cardiologists and nurses, and they can also include doulas, medical examiners and experts in mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. They review summaries of medical records to determine whether deaths were preventable and to identify contributing factors. This allows researchers and government officials to see patterns and come up with ways to improve the country's poor maternal health outcomes.\n\nCommittees are not systematically tracking an issue that came up throughout ProPublica's reporting on deaths in states with abortion bans: delays and denials of procedures, like dilation and curettage, which are used to empty the uterus during miscarriages to avoid hemorrhage and infection. The procedures are also used for abortions, and doctors face prison time for violating restrictions. Women have died after they could not access these procedures, ProPublica found.\n\nNevaeh Crain, a teenager whose organs were failing , was made to wait 90 minutes for a second ultrasound to confirm fetal demise. Amber Thurman suffered for 20 hours while sepsis spread. And Barnica was subjected to serious infection risks for 40 hours while doctors monitored the fetal heartbeat until it stopped.\n\nStudying such delays \"needs to be a part of these kinds of reviews,\" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a leading reproductive health care researcher and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nGrossman has collected dozens of accounts from health care providers detailing substandard treatment and poor outcomes in states that banned abortion. But he and others recognize who is ultimately in charge of state maternal mortality review committees.\n\n\"I can't imagine the states that passed restrictions saying, 'Now we want to know if that caused any deaths,'\" said Eugene Declercq, a professor at Boston University's School of Public Health who serves on Massachusetts' maternal mortality review committee. \"The clinicians and the public health people might want to know, but the political leaders would be aghast.\"\n\nEven if they start to pursue such answers, states are years behind in reviewing deaths, ProPublica found in a survey of 18 states with the most restrictive abortion laws. Most have not finished reviewing deaths from 2022, the year most bans became effective after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Two states are still reviewing 2021 deaths. Three states - Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota - did not respond.\n\nMost States With Abortion Bans Are Years Behind in Reviewing Maternal Deaths\n\nReviews typically lag years behind deaths because of the time it takes state health department employees to learn of cases, track down records and wrestle them free from hospitals and doctors before they summarize and redact them for review. \"We have one person in the entire state that has to collect all that data. Literally one,\" said Dr. Stacie Geller, a founding member of Illinois' committee. \"I live in fear of her retiring.\"\n\nThe CDC, which has pumped tens of millions of dollars into helping states establish these committees and standardizing their work, has tried to reduce the backlog by setting a goal for committees that receive funding to review cases within two years. However, there's no way to compel states to do so, and not all have caught up.\n\nSuch lags matter more in places where there has been a seismic shift in abortion access, experts told ProPublica, because there isn't a full understanding yet of the laws' effect on maternal health care.\n\nMarian Knight leads the United Kingdom's maternal mortality review program, widely seen as the world's best. She said if there were a major legal shift like this in her country, she and her colleagues would adapt to track the impact in close to real time. \"I would be monitoring that in the same way as I did during COVID, where we were analyzing data weekly and feeding it in,\" Knight said.\n\nAs of last month, only five states - Iowa, West Virginia, Indiana, Georgia and Tennessee - had finished reviewing cases from 2022, ProPublica found. None had yet published a report on its findings for that year.\n\nSeven other states were still examining 2022 cases: Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n\nIdaho, Texas and Kentucky had not yet started looking at cases from that year.\n\nEven though North Dakota did not respond to ProPublica's survey, reporters found that its committee, formed by state legislation in 2021, has never met to review cases, according to two members.\n\nIn some instances, state officials are responsible for delays.\n\nIdaho disbanded its committee in summer 2023 after a conservative group argued it was unnecessary and attacked members for recommending that the state expand Medicaid for postpartum patients. The move froze the group's work until last month, when a reconstituted, smaller committee met for the first time. Two members who had spoken out against the ban's impacts on maternal health, and are suing the state over it, were not brought back onto the committee. The state is defending its anti-abortion laws; the Idaho Attorney General has said he \"will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\"\n\nIt is unclear how long Georgia's reviews will be stalled after state officials dismissed its committee last month, citing a violation of confidentiality rules after ProPublica reported on internal documents in stories about two preventable deaths examined by the group. The Georgia Department of Public Health said in a letter about the dismissal that this would not result in any delays to the committee's responsibilities.\n\nIn a move that confused maternal research experts, Texas' committee said it would not review data from 2022 and 2023 and begin with reports from 2024 to get a more \"contemporary\" view of deaths. The committee has skipped years in the past to address gaps, and at its recent meeting, Ortique, the chair, said that the decision had \"absolutely no nefarious intent.\" The period it plans to skip includes two of the preventable deaths ProPublica reported.\n\nDr. Romy Ghosh, an OB-GYN in Austin, Texas, pleaded with the maternal mortality review committee at a public meeting this month to reconsider its decision to skip those years.\n\n\"There's been a lot of fear in my patients. They wonder, can I save their life if something goes wrong?\" she said. \"I think that this information will tell us there's either nothing to worry about or it will be damning.\"\n\nBetween the decision to skip years and the legal prohibition against examining cases involving abortion-related care, it appears Texas will not review any of the three preventable deaths ProPublica identified.\n\nThere is a limit to how much committee members can push back against state leaders.\n\nRead More\n\nWhen Texas delayed publishing its maternal mortality report in 2022, an election year, then-committee member Nakeenya Wilson, a community advocate, spoke out, saying \"withholding data that does not make us look good is dishonorably burying those women.\"\n\nThe next session, Texas lawmakers passed a bill changing the requirements for the position that Wilson held, effectively removing her from the committee. State officials appointed Dr. Ingrid Skop, a Texas OB-GYN who is the vice president of a prominent anti-abortion organization.\n\nWilson said maternal mortality review committees must be free to speak candidly about patterns they see in maternal deaths and to release information in a timely fashion.\n\n\"If it's not the committee, then who is it?\" she said. \"There has to be increased accountability.\"\n\nAudrey Dutton , Anna Maria Barry-Jester , Lizzie Presser and Amy Yurkanin contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI have been reporting on changes to reproductive health care access since Roe v.

      "text": "The State Behind Roe's Likely Demise Also Does the Least for New Parents in Need\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen it comes to reproductive care, Mississippi has a dual distinction. The state spawned the law that likely will lead to the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade. It is also unique among Deep South states for doing the least to provide health care coverage to low-income people who have given birth.\n\nMississippians on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, lose coverage a mere 60 days after childbirth. That's often well before the onset of postpartum depression or life-threatening, birth-related infections: A 2020 study found that people racked up 81% of their postpartum expenses between 60 days and a year after delivery. And Mississippi's own Maternal Mortality Review Committee found that 37% of pregnancy-related deaths between 2013 and 2016 occurred more than six weeks postpartum.\n\nEvery other state in the Deep South has extended or is in the process of extending Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum. Wyoming and South Dakota are the only other states where trigger laws will outlaw nearly all abortions if Roe falls and where lawmakers haven't expanded Medicaid or extended postpartum coverage.\n\n\"It's hypocrisy to say that we are pro-life on one end, that we want to protect the baby, but yet you don't want to pass this kind of legislation that will protect that mom who has to bear the responsibility of that child,\" said Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the MS Black Women's Roundtable, a nonprofit that works at the intersection of race, gender and economic justice.\n\nEfforts to extend coverage past 60 days have repeatedly failed in Mississippi - where 60% of births are covered by Medicaid - despite support from major medical associations and legislators on both sides of the aisle .\n\nMississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn, a Republican, said shortly after he killed the most recent bill that would've extended postpartum coverage that he's against expanding any form of Medicaid. \"We need to look for ways to keep people off, not put them on,\" he told The Associated Press in March. When asked about the issue during a May 8 interview on CNN, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said , \"When you talk about these young ladies, the best thing we can do for them is to provide and improve educational opportunities for them.\" (Neither Gunn nor Reeves responded to requests for comment.)\n\nDuring the pandemic, a change in federal rules prevented states from cutting off Medicaid recipients, which has allowed people in Mississippi and elsewhere to retain postpartum coverage beyond 60 days. But at the end of the federal public health emergency declaration - which is set to expire in July 2022 - states will revert to their prior policies. \"What we are afraid of is that when that does end, it will go back to what we knew was pre-pandemic health care,\" Welchlin said.\n\nWe discussed the implications of Mississippi's post-Roe reality with Welchlin and two other experts in the field: Alina Salganicoff, the Kaiser Family Foundation's director for women's health policy, and Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health. Their answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nSalganicoff: Typically, everything from assistance if the person is having problems breastfeeding to screening for depression services.\n\nWelchlin: We know the struggles of so many who have had life threatening illnesses such as heart conditions and hypertension. We know of course that Medicaid helps in that.\n\nWelchlin: One of the stories that really touched me over the course of this pandemic was that of a mom who already had a child, and she needed access to child care so she could get back and forth to the doctor. During this particular pregnancy she had a severe heart disorder where she couldn't breathe, and she had to get rushed to the hospital. Because she was so connected to doulas and a supportive care organization like us, she was able to get admitted and sure enough that's when they diagnosed her with that heart condition. And she was a mom on Medicaid.\n\nMiller: Only giving someone two months postpartum doesn't allow for the kind of continuation of care that you need. If there are indications of problems in the postpartum period, they don't all necessarily show up within the first two months. And we certainly know that the ability to have a healthy infant and keep an infant healthy is also related to whether you have coverage. The extension to 12 months really allows for that kind of continuum of care.\n\nWelchlin: We know in the state of Mississippi, women die at higher rates, and of course it's higher for Black women. And so, when women don't have that coverage, what happens is they die.\n\nMiller: These bans on abortion are going to be layered on top of an already-unconscionable maternal and infant health crisis that most particularly impacts those who are struggling to make ends meet. It particularly impacts Black women and other communities of color. ... A state like Mississippi that is so clearly wanting to ban abortions - the fact that they refuse to extend basic health care benefits that will help during pregnancy and postpartum just clearly indicates that they are not interested in the health and well-being of women and families and children, that they are purely on an ideological crusade.\n\nSalganicoff: We're very focused on that first year of life. But if you're speaking about a woman who is not going to be able to get an abortion that she seeks and ends up carrying the pregnancy, the supports that she's going to need and her child is going to need go far beyond the first year of life.\n\nRead More\n\nMiller: You can't have a conversation about legality or soon-to-be illegality of abortion in these states and not have a conversation simultaneously about the existing crisis around maternal and infant health. These things are all interconnected, and that's why it is so deeply disturbing that the states trying to ban abortion are the same states that are refusing to expand Medicaid under the ACA, that are failing to take advantage of the ability to extend postpartum [coverage] by 12 months, that don't invest in child care, that don't invest in education - these are all part of the same conversation.\n\nWelchlin: Audre Lorde said, \"There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.\" So, abortion access, reproductive justice, voting rights, racial justice, gender equity - these are not separate issues, they are intersecting issues that collectively determine the quality of our lives.\n\nFiled under -\n\nSarah Smith was a reporter covering housing, mental health, poverty and religion for ProPublica's South unit.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "These States Are Set to Ban Abortion if Roe v. Wade Is Overturned\n\nI f the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade , the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion in America, it would reshape women's reproductive rights across the country.\n\nA leaked draft of a Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , first reported by Politico Monday evening, would overturn Roe and return decisions about the legality of abortion to the states. Many states are considering or have passed so-called trigger laws, and other measures, that would rapidly curtail or outlaw abortion in the wake of such a ruling.\n\nThe Court is expected to issue its final ruling in Dobbs by the end of June, but the publication of the draft, and Politico's reporting that a majority of Supreme Court justices support overturning Roe , has focused attention on where abortion rights are most likely to be rolled back.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" Justice Samuel Alito writes in the draft document. In addition to Roe , the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey has upheld the constitutional right to abortion, and together they prohibited states from banning abortion before about 24 weeks, when a fetus is viable outside the womb.\n\nThe Supreme Court confirmed on Tuesday that the leaked draft opinion is authentic, but noted that the Court's decision in the case, which was argued Dec. 1, is not final and could still change before the justices ultimately issue their ruling.\n\nPoliticians and activists on both sides of the abortion debate reacted quickly to the leak, launching intense preparations for a likely new era of abortion in the U.S. There is no federal law protecting abortion, so rolling back Roe would create a starker patchwork of legality and access across the country. Some conservative-led states would quickly ban abortion, while others would push to restrict abortion in various ways and other, liberal-led states would protect abortion rights.\n\nIf the Supreme Court does overturn Roe , abortion would be outlawed in about half of the states. Most of this would happen through \"trigger laws,\" which are designed to take effect shortly after the Court strikes down Roe . Other states have laws on the books that were passed before 1973 that they could try to bring back, while still others have passed abortion restrictions in recent years that were blocked by courts, but which they could try to implement once Roe is no longer the law of the land.\n\nBecause of the varied state laws at play, there are several different forecasts of how many states will ban abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, a research firm that tracks abortion policy and supports reproductive rights, has estimated that 27 states are likely to ban abortion once Roe is gone. These include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal group that fights abortion restrictions and tracks state laws, counts 25 states as likely to ban abortion. It includes Pennsylvania but not Florida, Iowa or Montana.\n\nOnce the Court issues its final ruling, changes could start happening quickly. Of the 13 states with trigger laws, those in Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota appear set to take effect immediately. In Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, state attorneys general or other officials must take action to put the bans in effect. In Idaho, Tennessee and Texas, the laws would take effect 30 days after the Court strikes down Roe .\n\nThe leaked opinion draft could speed this process, says Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state abortion policy for Guttmacher. Though the leaked opinion is not final, it allows states to line up their legal arguments in favor of implementing other abortion restrictions. \"Everyone was expecting that Roe would be substantially damaged, perhaps overturned. Now we see where the court is going, which means that there's now a roadmap for how attorneys general are going to respond in these conservative states,\" Nash says.\n\nSix states have bans on abortion that were passed before 1973 and have not been repealed. And a number of others have passed laws in the last few years that courts have blocked because they were in violation of Roe v. Wade . If that precedent goes away, the states can try to bring those laws back into effect.\n\nMeanwhile, states like California, Colorado and Connecticut have passed laws protecting abortion in their state laws, and the glimpse at the Supreme Court's draft decision could encourage more liberal states to add extra protections.\n\nWrite to Abigail Abrams at abigail.abrams@time.com"

      "text": "The End of Roe, and How the Personal Became Political on the Supreme Court\n\nI n 1921, the future Supreme Court justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote a book examining how judges write their opinions. Judicial opinions, he asserted, did not simply reflect this or that legal theory but also the judges who wrote them-human beings influenced, as we all are, by upbringing and experience. \"All their lives,\" wrote Cardozo, \"forces which they do not recognize and cannot name, have been tugging at them-inherited instincts, traditional beliefs, acquired convictions; and the resultant is an outlook on life.\" He added: \"There has been a certain lack of candor in much of the discussion of the theme, or rather perhaps in the refusal to discuss it, as if judges must lose respect and confidence by the reminder that they are subject to human limitations.\"\n\nWhen Roe reached the Supreme Court fifty years later, its justices were no more inclined to discuss how anything but law molded their opinions. Lewis Powell, for one, did not reveal that a few years before, a teenaged messenger at his Virginia law firm came to him for help after an illegal abortion killed his girlfriend. The young man had taken her to the abortion provider, and had since been charged with manslaughter. Powell later told his clerks that this double tragedy was why he had sided with the majority in Roe . \"I don't want to live in a country,\" he said, \"where a young man and a young woman like that are forced to go to a back-alley butcher.\" Harry Blackmun, meantime, the justice who wrote the majority Roe opinion, had been working as counsel at the Mayo Clinic when he too encountered women harmed grievously by illegal abortion. But he said nothing publicly of them, just as he said nothing of his own daughter who, in 1966, was derailed by an unwanted pregnancy in college.\n\nIf the justices did not publicly confide these experiences, Blackmun did assert, in a preamble to Roe , that people often form their opinions of abortion based on their exposure to it-to what Blackmun termed \"the raw edges of human existence.\" He was right. For abortion had not yet been overtaken by politics. Indeed, both Powell and Blackmun had been nominated to the court by the Republican Richard Nixon while their fellow justice, Byron White, who opposed legalizing abortion, had been nominated by the Democrat John Kennedy. Kennedy's younger brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, also opposed abortion which he described as an affront to his Catholicism.\n\nThere was thus still room in this country for what Cardozo had called \"acquired convictions.\" And as the years passed, politicians continued to acquire convictions that ran counter to their parties' ideologies. Ronald Reagan endorsed background checks on buyers of guns after his press secretary was shot. Dick Cheney supported gay marriage after his daughter came out. John McCain co-sponsored an anti-torture amendment years after he himself had been tortured. And Joe Biden, a traditional Catholic, supported the idea of a constitutional amendment that would allow states to overturn Roe. \"I'm probably a victim, or a product, however you want to phrase it, of my background,\" he explained. Experience trumped politics.\n\nWhen it came to abortion, however, more and more, politics trumped experience.\n\nThe politicization of abortion began before Roe . In 1971, Nixon about-faced on the matter after his advisor Pat Buchanan suggested that he do so to win Catholic votes. The next year, a referendum in Michigan put the question of abortion on the ballot state-wide. But abortion did not begin to become a partisan issue until 1975 when presidential-candidate Ronald Reagan backed the \"aims\" of a human life amendment which would grant the unborn personhood. The National Right to Life Committee-which was led by Dr. Mildred Jefferson who had helped bring Reagan into the pro-life fold-challenged the other presidential candidates to take a position on the amendments, thereby turning abortion, wrote the New York Times , \"into one of the major issues of the 1976 Presidential campaign.\" The two political parties responded by adopting, in their official platforms, positions on abortion.\n\nRead More : The Failure of the Feminist Industrial Complex\n\nBy 1980, the GOP was actively using abortion to court not only Catholics but the newly-forming evangelical vote. And after Reagan was elected president, he determined that federal judges, rather than laws, offered a clearer path to toppling Roe . He'd appointed more than one hundred of them when in 1984, Americans United for Life, a legal advocacy group, held a press conference titled \"Reversing Roe v. Wade through the Courts.\"\n\nJudges themselves, however, could not be so explicit. This much was clear when in 1987, Reagan nominated to the Supreme Court Robert Bork-a judge who had called Roe a \"wholly unjustifiable judicial usurpation of state legislative authority.\" Ted Kennedy, who had become pro-choice, warned that \"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions.\" After the Senate then rejected Bork's nomination, Senate confirmation hearings became not only a \"proxies on Roe ,\" as one journalist called them, but a charade that left would-be justices to pretend that they had no thoughts on the ruling.\n\nMore scrutiny of justices meant that there was less room for them to express personal convictions on abortion. For personal conviction would not only remind the public that justices, as Cardozo wrote, were human beings with outlooks on life, but might further be seen as political. Nonetheless, the court could still manage to transcend the politics enveloping abortion as when, in 1992, in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey , which concerned five abortion regulations, a Supreme Court composed of eight Republican appointees and Byron White preserved the core of Roe: legal abortion through viability.\n\nOne of the eight was Sandra Day O'Connor. The first female justice on the court, and a married mother of three, she wrote that same year of the influence her newly retired colleague Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice, had had upon her and their fellow justices. \"Justice Marshall,\" she wrote , \"imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences, constantly pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth.\" So O'Connor did. It is unsurprising that the one abortion regulation the plurality opinion in Casey that she helped to write struck down required married women to get consent from their husbands. Noted the opinion: \"Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry.\"\n\nConservatives were exasperated-most of all with Justice David Souter, the George Bush nominee who helped to orchestrate the Casey ruling by winning over to it both O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy. (Souter argued, in the words of Casey , that to overrule a precedent as longstanding as Roe would be to \"surrender to political pressure.\") \"No More Souters\" became a conservative cry. And today, thirty years later, the Supreme Court reflects it. Indeed, in its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that struck down Roe , every justice but one voted along party lines.\n\nCardozo would struggle to recognize the court he once served. For one hundred and one years after he observed that justices and their opinions are subject not only to law but life, both have been overtaken by politics.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Dwyane Wade on Netflix's New Redeem Team Doc-and His Favorite Kobe Bryant Memory\n\nO n Aug. 15, 2004, the United States suffered sports humiliation, on the most global of stages. At the Athens Olympics, Puerto Rico trounced the American men's basketball team, 92-73, the preliminary round opener. For the first time, the U.S. men's team lost in Olympic competition while suiting up NBA players; pros like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson first played in the Olympics in 1992, for the Dream Team . A dozen years later, the likes of Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, and Stephon Marbury-and a very young LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , and Carmelo Anthony- were getting blown out.\n\nThe U.S. would lose two more games-to Lithuania and Argentina-during that Olympic tournament, and finish with a bronze. After that embarrassment, USA Basketball reformed its men's national program. Jerry Colangelo took over as managing director, Mike Krzyzewski became coach, and they set out building a true national team. Kobe Bryant, James, Wade, and other stars bought in: their request to reclaim the gold medal during the 2008 Beijing Olympics is the subject of a new documentary, The Redeem Team , now streaming on Netflix.\n\nTIME caught up with Wade, a key member of that '08 Olympic squad and currently a minority owner of the Utah Jazz, to talk about the film, standout moments from the Redeem Team's path to gold, and the latest basketball sensation: French teenager Victor Webanyama, who shined in recent games while playing in the U.S. and is sure to be the top selection in next year's NBA Draft.\n\nWade: I was just talking about this with Melo [Carmelo Anthony] last night at a screening. Just getting the bronze medal and watching Argentina celebrate. Just seeing the joy. That was a happiness and a joy that you really don't get to see. These guys grew up together. You realize how much it meant. And so I remember. It's in my brain, watching them celebrate and jump around. It hurts so bad.\n\nThat moment for me will never go away. Even now. We won [in 2008]. But I still remember that moment. It meant more to them. We watched that and were like, OK, I want to feel that.\n\nIt comes across in small moments in the documentary. I think people have to understand too, when you watch the doc, you're looking at one point a 19-year-old LeBron, and at another point, a 22-year-old LeBron. This is a young, young guy. You watch his vocalness on the court, how he talks to his guys, how he talks to his teammates ... people don't do that. People don't really talk on the court. They just play.\n\nHe's a conductor, right? At a young age. He never shut up, which is great. And then off the court. Like he said in the doc, Kobe needs to laugh too. He likes to have fun. He wants to be accepted. So he does a great job in the Olympics of knowing how to use his comedic timing and his jokes. He always took those moments, any time it was quiet, to crack jokes. Do starting lineups in other voices. Whether he was on the floor or on the bench on the bus, he was just always going at that time. I'm sure he's way different now, as he gets older. But when he was young, he just had that motor.\n\nYou're looking at two guys who are polar opposites. They could not be more opposite, in a lot of ways. But the similarity is the greatness that they both have inside. The demand on themselves to be great, which demands the ones around them, if they have it, to be great.\n\nThere's more than one way to do it. It's not just Kob's way, it's not just Bron's way. There's many ways to get to the success that you crave for yourself and for your teammates. I remember being there when they were going to do that interview. You've got to understand, they didn't have a lot of interaction outside of being competitors at that time. And there was a lot of talk back then of who was better, the young LeBron or the older Kobe. None of us had seen the interview. It wasn't like they came to show us. I think a lot of people's first time seeing this is going to be now.\n\nIt was one of those moments where we were all like, man, we all hope it goes as it should. Not that they had any beef. It was what the media was building up. We know the competitor that Kobe is. We know what Bron is trying to accomplish. And a lot of it is you've got to throw that guy off his throne to be called the best in the game. That's what I look at when I see that interview.\n\nBecause of '04. I was a part of it now. And in '06, we lost again, in Worlds in Japan . I took some hard Ls back to the States. It was embarrassing.\n\nIt's one thing to lose in the NBA Finals. It's OK to lose to Dirk [Nowitzki], to Jason Kidd and all those guys. But when you're losing to guys who no one knows, these are faceless players to a lot of people. It has an embarrassing effect. And now in 2007 I was injured, I'm there in Vegas, I'm watching the team [in Olympic qualifying] and I see them win and I'm happy for them. But now I'm starting to feel a little left out.\n\nI worked my butt off to be a part of the team because I wanted to win a gold medal. I wanted to redeem us as a team, but also at that time of my life, I wanted redemption for myself. A lot of people said it was over for me. They said I was going to have the injuries that Anfernee Hardaway had. Or even though he had a great career, T-Mac [Tracy McGrady] got hit with injuries, and they were saying I was going to be that guy. I needed to go out and tell a different story.\n\n[Laughs]. In the words of Coach K, it surprised the f-ck out of me.\n\nI didn't know. I shouldn't have been surprised. I've been around coaches my whole life. When you're in competition, you're not looking for the right word. You're looking for the word is going to put the emphasis on something. Coach K, he was dropping them. And I was just like, \"Oh, I like this guy.\" He was just being himself. I think it was because we didn't know a lot about Coach K. You see the wins, the smile, the bowl cut when he was younger. Then I got to experience the man, and the man is intense. And so it was a little surprising, but it was a welcome surprise, coming from an intense organization like I came from.\n\nThey actually let you get very physical in an overseas play. That's one thing that shocked me when I first got over there. Because you hear this notion that overseas players are soft. You realize once you get over there, they're not soft but very skilled. I got away with a couple of hits. And people got away with a couple of hits on me over the years. It was different play. And Kobe knew it. In that game, because it wasn't a gold medal game, I don't even think he thought about that, or cared. He was trying to send a statement. We are coming for you. He was showing us that that's not my brother. Y'all my brothers.\n\nIt's going to be a little selfish. I never really talk about it a lot. I was coming off injuries, but I was a star in the league. At the time, felt like I was one of the top three players in the league, with LeBron and Kobe. And so one of the moments that was important to me, and it showed a lot about our team, was when Coach K and I talked about me coming off the bench. I still was the third-best player on the team. And arguably, in some moments, I thought I was one.\n\nKobe came to me right after a practice. I wasn't down. I just was like, I've got to figure this out. Coming off the bench, how am I going to do this? Kobe came to me and he said, All right, so when we're in the game together-and he just totally went past me coming off the bench-he was like, yo, when me and you are playing together, I'm going to pick up 94 feet. And when I pick up, I'm going to turn my guy, and I want you to come through the passing lanes. And if you watch any of that, you will see me running through passing lanes for steals. And a lot of it was 'cause Kob let me know.\n\nThink about it. He's the champion. He's the 30-year-old. I'm the younger one. He knew my strength. And he allowed my strength to shine, knowing that I was coming off the bench. So that gave me so much confidence. That's one of my favorite stories that I never really talk about a lot. That's leadership.\n\nI don't know how much I can comment on Victor, because I'm an NBA owner. Obviously we all are fans, and everyone loves the potential of these young guys and everything, but I don't know how much I can comment.\n\nThe whole league has interest in, what did 'Bron call him, an alien ?\n\nWhy wouldn't everyone have interest in him? And obviously the teams that are going to have the best chance [to get him] are going to be the teams that aren't as good as the Golden State Warriors, right? But everyone has interest in something we've never seen.\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com"

      "text": "Dwyane Wade on Netflix's New Redeem Team Doc-and His Favorite Kobe Bryant Memory\n\nO n Aug. 15, 2004, the United States suffered sports humiliation, on the most global of stages. At the Athens Olympics, Puerto Rico trounced the American men's basketball team, 92-73, the preliminary round opener. For the first time, the U.S. men's team lost in Olympic competition while suiting up NBA players; pros like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson first played in the Olympics in 1992, for the Dream Team . A dozen years later, the likes of Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, and Stephon Marbury-and a very young LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , and Carmelo Anthony- were getting blown out.\n\nThe U.S. would lose two more games-to Lithuania and Argentina-during that Olympic tournament, and finish with a bronze. After that embarrassment, USA Basketball reformed its men's national program. Jerry Colangelo took over as managing director, Mike Krzyzewski became coach, and they set out building a true national team. Kobe Bryant, James, Wade, and other stars bought in: their request to reclaim the gold medal during the 2008 Beijing Olympics is the subject of a new documentary, The Redeem Team , now streaming on Netflix.\n\nTIME caught up with Wade, a key member of that '08 Olympic squad and currently a minority owner of the Utah Jazz, to talk about the film, standout moments from the Redeem Team's path to gold, and the latest basketball sensation: French teenager Victor Webanyama, who shined in recent games while playing in the U.S. and is sure to be the top selection in next year's NBA Draft.\n\nWade: I was just talking about this with Melo [Carmelo Anthony] last night at a screening. Just getting the bronze medal and watching Argentina celebrate. Just seeing the joy. That was a happiness and a joy that you really don't get to see. These guys grew up together. You realize how much it meant. And so I remember. It's in my brain, watching them celebrate and jump around. It hurts so bad.\n\nThat moment for me will never go away. Even now. We won [in 2008]. But I still remember that moment. It meant more to them. We watched that and were like, OK, I want to feel that.\n\nIt comes across in small moments in the documentary. I think people have to understand too, when you watch the doc, you're looking at one point a 19-year-old LeBron, and at another point, a 22-year-old LeBron. This is a young, young guy. You watch his vocalness on the court, how he talks to his guys, how he talks to his teammates ... people don't do that. People don't really talk on the court. They just play.\n\nHe's a conductor, right? At a young age. He never shut up, which is great. And then off the court. Like he said in the doc, Kobe needs to laugh too. He likes to have fun. He wants to be accepted. So he does a great job in the Olympics of knowing how to use his comedic timing and his jokes. He always took those moments, any time it was quiet, to crack jokes. Do starting lineups in other voices. Whether he was on the floor or on the bench on the bus, he was just always going at that time. I'm sure he's way different now, as he gets older. But when he was young, he just had that motor.\n\nYou're looking at two guys who are polar opposites. They could not be more opposite, in a lot of ways. But the similarity is the greatness that they both have inside. The demand on themselves to be great, which demands the ones around them, if they have it, to be great.\n\nThere's more than one way to do it. It's not just Kob's way, it's not just Bron's way. There's many ways to get to the success that you crave for yourself and for your teammates. I remember being there when they were going to do that interview. You've got to understand, they didn't have a lot of interaction outside of being competitors at that time. And there was a lot of talk back then of who was better, the young LeBron or the older Kobe. None of us had seen the interview. It wasn't like they came to show us. I think a lot of people's first time seeing this is going to be now.\n\nIt was one of those moments where we were all like, man, we all hope it goes as it should. Not that they had any beef. It was what the media was building up. We know the competitor that Kobe is. We know what Bron is trying to accomplish. And a lot of it is you've got to throw that guy off his throne to be called the best in the game. That's what I look at when I see that interview.\n\nBecause of '04. I was a part of it now.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: What is US Supreme Court ruling on abortion?\n\nAbortion was made legal across the US after a landmark legal ruling in 1973, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\n\nNow the US Supreme Court - the nation's most senior legal body - has overturned that right.\n\nTwenty-six conservative states are either certain or considered likely to introduce new abortion restrictions or bans.\n\nIn 1969, a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey using the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas. The state forbade abortion as unconstitutional, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.\n\nDefending the anti-abortion law was Henry Wade - the district attorney for Dallas County - hence Roe v Wade.\n\nMs McCorvey was pregnant with her third child when she filed the case, and claimed that she had been raped. But the case was rejected and she was forced to give birth.\n\nIn 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court, where her case was heard alongside that of a 20-year-old Georgia woman, Sandra Bensing.\n\nThey argued that abortion laws in Texas and Georgia went against the US Constitution because they infringed a woman's right to privacy.\n\nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\n\nThey judged that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\n\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system allowing:\n\nRoe v Wade also established that in the final trimester, a woman can obtain an abortion despite any legal ban only if doctors certify it is necessary to save her life or health.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks .\n\nIn doing so, it has effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion for millions of US women.\n\nIndividual states are now able to ban the procedure again.\n\nHalf of the states in the US are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.\n\nThirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court's ruling. A number of others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly.\n\nThere are nine judges on the Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nA draft opinion from one of these - Judge Samuel Alito - was leaked in May 2022. It contained the comment that the Roe v Wade judgement is \"egregiously wrong\".\n\nEven before the US Supreme Court's latest ruling, anti-abortion campaigners had been regaining some ground.\n\nIn 1980, the court upheld a law that banned the use of federal funds for abortion except when necessary to save a woman's life.\n\nThen in 1989, it allowed states to prohibit abortions being carried out in state clinics, or by state employees.\n\nThe biggest impact came from the top court's ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992.\n\nIt said states could restrict abortions even in the first trimester for non-medical reasons.\n\nAs a result, many states already have restrictions in place, such as requirements that young pregnant women involve their parents or a judge in their abortion decision.\n\nOther states already have waiting periods between the time a woman first visits an abortion clinic and the actual procedure.\n\nAs a result, many women are having to travel further to get abortions, often across state borders, and they are having to pay more for them.\n\nThe government has said Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported in error, but has resisted returning him to the US.\n\nA judge had blocked the Trump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that El Salvador cannot be compelled to return Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian migrant, to the US.\n\nThe case has pitted one Texas' abortion ban against New York's shield law for abortion providers\n\nThe Biden-era regulations require gun makers to perform background checks on people who purchase the weapons kits.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Statue of NBA star Dwyane Wade sparks fan backlash\n\nA newly unveiled statue of beloved US basketball star Dwyane Wade has sparked online backlash after some said they couldn't see a resemblance to the ex-Miami Heat icon.\n\nThe statue depicts Wade yelling \"this is my house\" after scoring a game-winning three-point shot against the Chicago Bulls in 2009. Wade called the statue \"beautiful\" when it was unveiled in Miami on Sunday.\n\nBut critics said the statue's face looks more like actors Laurence Fishburne or Kelsey Grammer. Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce was among the haters, saying Wade needed a \"redo\" because he's too \"legendary\".\n\nOn Monday, one of the sculptors responsible for creating the bronze artwork defended it, saying that not everybody will have \"a positive reaction\".\n\nOn Monday, Omri Amrani told Front Office Sports , \"I want to be an artist that creates an in-your-face response and you cannot expect all of human society will have a positive reaction.\"\n\nThe iconic moment that the statue depicts was chosen by Wade himself, said Mr Amrani, who also has created statues of NBA legends, including Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.\n\nWade made multiple trips to the art studio to collaborate on the project.\n\nBut online, some said the statue looked more like a zombie from the movie I Am Legend.\n\nWade, however, said he loves the statue.\n\n\"Personally, I'm biased, I think it's one of the best statues that's been created because of what it represents for us and for me,\" he told the Miami-Herald .\n\nThe incident recalls several other widely criticised statues from the past, including the unveiling of a statue of Queen Elizabeth II in the UK last month .\n\nThere also was the statue of football player Cristiano Ronaldo at a Portuguese airport . It was unveiled a second time after an extensive makeover.\n\nAnd the statue of famous US comedian and TV star Lucille Ball, unveiled in New York in 2009 was dubbed \"Scary Lucy\"  by local residents, due to its haunted expression.\n\nThe statue was replaced by another artist's in 2016 after a social media campaign to remove it.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Four ways the end of Roe v Wade has changed America\n\nA year ago, the US Supreme Court delivered a historic ruling that ended the nationwide right to abortion, impacting the lives of millions of women and transforming the political landscape.\n\nOn 24 June, 2022, America's top court overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling which had guaranteed women the right to an abortion up until the point of foetal viability, which is about 24 weeks.\n\nIn its Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, the conservative majority on the court turned over the power to regulate abortion - or ban it outright - to individual states.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement celebrated a landmark victory, while pro-choice activists warned of a looming public health crisis.\n\nHere are four ways the US has changed in the year since:\n\nAfter spending almost half a century fighting to overturn Roe, opponents were prepared to take advantage when the moment finally came. Thirteen states had passed \"trigger bills\" that enabled them to begin the process of banning abortion immediately after the Dobbs decision.\n\nA year on, 14 states, including most of the South, have enacted near-total bans from the moment of conception. Georgia banned abortion after six weeks, which is before most women know they are pregnant.\n\nThat means that about 22 million women of reproductive age live in a state that has banned abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute , representing about a third of the total childbearing population.\n\nAnother five states have introduced bans after 12-20 weeks gestation, while court challenges against stricter abortion limits are still pending in five others. Millions more women will see their access to the procedure reduced.\n\n\"There's this sense that the end of Roe is catapulting us into an abortion-free future,\" Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins told the BBC last January during the annual March for Life protest.\n\nBut what access a woman has to abortion, depends on where she lives - and which party is in power in that place.\n\nWhile many, if not all, Republican-controlled states have restricted access, lots of progressive states run by Democrats, such as California and Colorado, have introduced stronger legal protections.\n\nAlmost a million abortions were carried out in the US in 2020, the last year there is full data for, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The anti-abortion movement wants to get that down to zero eventually, but hopes the state-wide bans and tighter restrictions will dramatically reduce the total.\n\nWe do not know the full impact of the laws introduced so far. However, data provided by WeCount , a research initiative funded by the pro-choice Society of Family Planning, suggests a significant impact already.\n\nAccording to WeCount, there were 24,290 fewer legal abortions overall between July 2022 and March 2023, compared to an average calculated in the months before the Dobbs decision. The project tracked abortions provided by clinics, private medical offices, hospitals, and virtual-only clinics, but did not track self-managed abortions.\n\nUnsurprisingly, states with abortion bans showed the biggest declines. In contrast, legal abortions increased, but to a lesser degree, in neighbouring states where the procedure was protected, notably Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina.\n\nAs illustrated by the WeCount data, many women in states who wanted an abortion chose to travel across state lines. As more states pass bans, the nearest clinic providing abortion services can be hundreds of miles away.\n\nThat led to longer journeys overall, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found.\n\nThe study mapped the average travel time from census tracts to the nearest abortion clinic. Before Dobbs, the average journey to a clinic took between 10.0 to 27.8 minutes. After Dobbs, getting to the nearest clinic almost quadrupled, with upper-end travel times averaging over 100 minutes.\n\nDr Judy Levison, a Houston doctor who has been practising for four decades and is part of a lawsuit challenging Texas's ban , worries that is a barrier for low-income women who make up the majority of those who have abortions.\n\n\"Where were they going to get an abortion? How were they going to afford travelling, getting childcare, risking two days not working and risking their employment perhaps?\" she told the BBC.\n\nSupport for abortion in the US has been steady over the past 30 years, with about 60% of Americans believing abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research. Overall, the think tank found that people's support for abortion goes down as a pregnancy continues.\n\nBut in the year after the Supreme Court decision, public support for abortion has actually gone up. And that's been the case, too, even in places which have instituted bans.\n\nIn 2019, about 31% of people in states that would later institute bans believed that abortion should be easier to access. But in 2023, after those bans were put in place, 46% of the population thought it should be easier, according to surveys conducted by Pew.\n\nHow people view abortion is still largely shaped by their politics - 84% of Democrats believe abortion should be legal in most cases, compared to 40% of Republicans. But when proposed abortion restrictions were directly on the ballot in conservative states, they have failed.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterm elections, ballot measures failed in Kentucky and Montana, presenting a quandary for Republicans. Bans and restrictions are popular with the conservative base, but they risk turning off more moderate voters who believe abortion should remain legal.\n\nWith reporting from Nada Tawfik and Holly Honderich\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: US Supreme Court ends constitutional right to abortion\n\nMillions of women in the US will lose the constitutional right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision.\n\nThe judgement paves the way for individual states to ban the procedure.\n\nHalf are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans. Thirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws to automatically outlaw abortion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden described it as \"a tragic error\" and urged states to enact laws to allow the procedure.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, abortion access is expected to be cut off for about 36 million women of reproductive age, according to research from Planned Parenthood, a healthcare organisation that provides abortions.\n\nDemonstrators from both sides had gathered outside the court, with police keeping them apart.\n\nOne anti-abortion activist told the BBC she was \"elated\" as her side cheered the decision. \"It's not enough just to make this the law of the land. To be pro-life is to make [abortion] unthinkable,\" she said.\n\nAcross the divide, pro-choice supporters decried the decision as \"illegitimate\" and even a form of \"fascism\".\n\nThe BBC's Samantha Granville, reporting from an abortion clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas, said that as the ruling was posted, doors to the patient area were shut and the sound of distant sobbing could be heard before she was asked to leave. The state is one of those subject to a trigger law.\n\nThe landmark 1973 Roe v Wade case saw the Supreme Court rule by a vote of seven to two that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\n\nThe ruling gave American women an absolute right to an abortion in the first three months (trimester) of pregnancy, but allowed for restrictions in the second trimester and for prohibitions in the third.\n\nBut in the decades since, anti-abortion rulings have gradually pared back access in more than a dozen states.\n\nIn its current session, the Supreme Court had been considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, that challenged Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nBy ruling in favour of the state, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nFive justices were firmly in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that, whilst he supported the Mississippi ban, he would not have gone further.\n\nThe three justices who disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - wrote that they had done so \"with sorrow - for this court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection\".\n\nFriday's ruling amounts to a wholesale reversal of the Supreme Court's own legal precedent - an extremely rare move - and is likely to set up political battles that divide the nation.\n\nIn states where opinions on abortion are closely split - such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - the legality of the procedure could be determined on an election-by-election basis. In others, the ruling may set off a new round of legal battles, including over whether individuals can go out of state for abortions or order abortion drugs through mail services.\n\nDenouncing the Supreme Court ruling, President Biden told women in states where it was banned to travel to those where it was not.\n\nDemocratic governors of several states including California, New Mexico and Michigan have already announced plans to enshrine abortion rights within their constitutions.\n\nGovernor of Mississippi Tate Reeves quickly welcomed the ruling, saying his state had \"led the nation to overcome one of the greatest injustices in the history of our country\".\n\n\"This decision will directly result in more hearts beating, more strollers pushed, more report cards given, more little league games played, and more lives well lived. It is a joyous day!\" he wrote.\n\nFormer Vice-President Mike Pence, a long-standing critic of Roe v Wade, urged supporters not to stop until \"the sanctity of life\" was protected by law in every state.\n\nOn the other side of the divide, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said that \"the Republican-controlled Supreme Court\" had achieved that party's \"dark and extreme goal\".\n\n\"American women today have less freedom than their mothers,\" she wrote. \"This cruel ruling is outrageous and heart-wrenching.\"\n\nThe reversal of a long-standing precedent has also raised fears for other rights decided upon by the Supreme Court in the past.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in his opinion, wrote: \"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell\" - referencing three landmark decisions of the past on the right to contraception, the repeal of anti-sodomy laws, and the legalisation of same-sex marriage respectively.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: The world reacts to US abortion ruling\n\nThe US Supreme Court's overturning of the constitutional right to abortion is being felt in countries across the world, where activists on both sides of the debate have been explaining what it means to them.\n\nOur correspondents in Italy, El Salvador, India, Ireland and Canada report on the reverberations being felt where they are.\n\nBy Mark Lowen, BBC News, Rome\n\nIn 1978, five years after Roe v Wade, Italy legalised abortion with Law 194. And while it is not the same lightning rod political issue here, the rise of a new hard-right conservative politics, ever closer to the Catholic church, has brought it back into focus - and the US Supreme Court's decision is reverberating in Italy too.\n\nFrom the political left and centre, there's been a chorus of condemnation and alarm. Emma Bonino, a leftist former foreign minister who helped pass Law 194, said it showed the risk in Italy of moving backwards and of \"losing achievements that had seemed permanent.\"\n\nBut on the right, some feel galvanised.\n\n\"A great victory\", declared Simone Pillon from the far-right League, adding that he hoped Italy and Europe would follow suit.\n\nHowever, his party leader, Matteo Salvini, was notably more nuanced, stating that he believes \"in the value of life... but on pregnancy, the last word belongs to the woman\" - perhaps a recognition that the majority of Italians say they still support the right to abort.\n\nWhile it's unlikely abortion would be restricted here, Law 194 allowed for conscientious objection by doctors - and across the country, around 70% of medics now refuse to perform the procedure. In some regions, it's 90%.\n\nWith the Vatican in its backyard, Italy is often behind the curve on some social issues, such as LGBT rights. There is pride among many that abortion was fought for, and enshrined in law, decades ago. But it is for some a raw nerve - and the US decision will touch that.\n\nBy Emma Vardy, BBC Ireland correspondent\n\nAcross the island of Ireland news of the US Supreme Court ruling has triggered a swift and passionate response. The issue stirs deep emotions here where abortion was only relatively recently decriminalised. Many vocal Irish campaign groups and activists still exist on both sides.\n\n\"The world continues to watch America become unrecognisable,\" wrote Dr Jennifer Cassidy on Twitter, a university lecturer who was in Dublin in 2018 when jubilant crowds celebrated as the Republic of Ireland voted to decriminalise abortion.\n\nMany on the pro-choice side have been reliving memories of that day, now expressing their horror at what they are witnessing in the US.\n\nThe story of Savita Halappanavar, who died of sepsis in Ireland in 2012, because she was not allowed a termination, is now being reshared widely in Ireland, by people warning Americans to prepare themselves for many similar deaths.\n\nA \"shameful decision\" said Grainne Taggart of Amnesty International, who has fought hard for abortion rights in Northern Ireland.\n\nBut campaigners who were devastated by the legalisation of abortion on the island of Ireland have been reinvigorated.\n\n\"Its a bit of a wake-up for us here,\" said Bernie Smyth, one of Northern Ireland's most prominent anti-abortion campaigners. \"There's a lot to be learnt from what is happening in the US.\"\n\n\"My personal hope for the future is that we too will one day reverse the legislation. I think the movement in the US have been very wise. This brings a lot of hope, and the battle goes on.\"\n\nBy Will Grant, BBC News, San Salvador, El Salvador\n\nJust as they felt the tide was beginning to turn on abortion in Latin America, many reproductive rights' campaigners now fear the worst following the Supreme Court ruling on Roe V Wade.\n\n\"This will embolden the most conservative groups in our countries who consistently deny women rights\", says Mariana Moisa, a leading pro-abortion rights' activist in El Salvador where abortion is banned in all cases including where the mother's life is endangered, rape or incest.\n\n\"The denial of the human rights of women and girls being forced to bear children who are the product of abuse\" already disproportionately affects the poorest in society, she says.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion politicians who control El Salvador's parliament have welcomed the move and insist that their position on abortion remains the dominant view in the Americas.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court was solely concerned with the law in US states, Washington continues to exercise a huge influence over Central America. Ms Moisa says the message being sent out by this ruling is stark.\n\n\"It's lamentable. A retrograde step which only goes to illustrate the contempt and lack of concern which exists around the world for women.\"\n\nBy Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Toronto\n\nCanada doesn't often like to butt its nose in its neighbour's - and largest trading partner's - business.\n\nBut when the Supreme Court overruled Roe v Wade, Canada's progressive-leaning prime minister, Justin Trudeau, did not mince words, calling it a \"devastating setback\" and \"horrific\" for women.\n\n\"Quite frankly, it's an attack on everyone's freedoms and rights,\" Mr Trudeau said from the Commonwealth summit in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nAbortion has been de-criminalised in Canada since 1983, but access is not a guaranteed right. In many areas, women have to drive for hours to get abortions.\n\nThere are many anti-abortion Canadians, but the issue has not been politicised to the same degree as it has south of the border.\n\nRightNow, a Canadian anti-abortion organisation, tweeted that it was a \"truly historic day for our friends in the United States\".\n\nBy Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi\n\nGender justice activists in India have described the ruling as \"a huge step back for women's rights\" and say it's guided by \"Victorian morality\".\n\nDr Veena JS, activist and forensic medicine professor who teaches medical ethics to doctors, says the Roe v Wade ruling will impact women's reproductive rights not just in the US but have a cascading effect around the world too.\n\n\"America is generally a model for the world and I fear, at some point, India could take a cue from them and bring in a similar legislation,\" she says. \"And we will be forced to raise children we don't want.\"\n\nThis, Dr Veena says, will affect the physical and mental health of women and children.\n\n\"Research has shown that post-partum psychosis and depression increases in women who are forced against their will to give birth. The quality of life of these 'unwanted' children will also be poor.\"\n\nAbortions have been legal in India since 1971, although with conditions, especially to curb female foeticide in a country with an overwhelming preference for sons.\n\nBut because of a general lack of awareness among women, stigma attached to the topic and doctors' reluctance to perform abortions out of religious or moral beliefs mean a majority of abortions are still held outside of registered medical facilities.\n\nThe case has pitted one Texas' abortion ban against New York's shield law for abortion providers\n\nMaria Margarita Rojas faces criminal charges for allegedly providing abortions in Texas, where there is a near-total abortion ban.\n\nSome states restrict access for women following the overturning of Roe v Wade.\n\nThe case appears to mark the first time a provider has faced criminal charges for mailing the medication.\n\n\"I think he is a horrible president when it comes to abortion,\" says one man who Trump pardoned yesterday.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: Why this is a seismic day in America\n\nThe Supreme Court just lobbed a constitutional hand grenade into the raging culture wars in the US, igniting a fresh battle in this decades-long fight over abortion.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the court found that there was no constitutional right to abortion, turning the decision of whether to allow abortions or not up to the states. Millions of women are now expected to lose access.\n\nWhile this legal ruling will change the law, it will not settle the arguments over abortion. It will inflame them.\n\nJubilant anti-abortion campaigners have achieved something that seemed practically impossible only a few years ago. They believe thousands of babies' lives will now be saved.\n\nPro-choice advocates are left utterly dismayed as they think women's rights have just been set back 50 years. Back to a time when women died as a result of illegal back-street abortions.\n\nRecent polls suggest around two-thirds of Americans did not want to see the constitutional right to abortion removed.\n\nIn such contentious times, even the lofty Supreme Court itself becomes a leading character in the narrative, not just an adjudicator. Before this ruling came out, a man with a gun and knife was arrested outside the home of one of the more conservative justices, saying he was upset by a leak of the draft ruling. Supreme Court justices now have to have security protection. That's how incendiary this issue is.\n\nThis decision was based on their interpretation of constitutional law, but it's also deeply political. When the court overturns a previous ruling it inevitably looks to critics to be more political than constitutional.\n\nThe court has a 6-3 conservative super majority, thanks to the three justices appointed by Donald Trump. He made a specific campaign promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe v Wade - and those appointments will probably be his most lasting legacy.\n\nThe seismic political impact of the Supreme Court's ruling will be felt across all 50 states, but the immediate practical impact of much more restrictive laws is likely to happen in half of them.\n\nOne of those states is Oklahoma, which last month passed the most restrictive abortion legislation in America - a total ban from the point of conception with few exceptions.\n\nWhen I met state representative Wendi Stearman in Tulsa, she told me it is her honour and privilege to have authored the bill.  She says she will be helping 4,000 unborn children every year \"to have a chance at life\".\n\nWhen I asked her if she believed the legislation will stop abortions happening in Oklahoma she said no - but that it will make them more difficult to obtain.\n\nShe argues that in all but a tiny minority of cases women can choose not to become pregnant before conception and that \"most women just use abortion as a form of contraception\".\n\nThat's an argument vehemently refuted by Andrea Gallego,, who runs an abortion clinic in Tulsa. She says the decision to have an abortion is often the hardest decision any woman will ever make.\n\nA few weeks ago her clinic was treating around 40 pregnant patients every day. When I visited, the waiting rooms and treatment facilities were completely empty. Only a few staff remain - answering calls and giving out information about clinics in other states.\n\n\"Patients have been begging for help,\" she says. \"It's devastating. These laws don't prevent abortion. They just add extra burdens to patients.\"\n\nWhat is already happening in Oklahoma will now be replicated in other states.\n\nNow that Roe v Wade is overturned, 26 states could further restrict abortion access, including 13 states that have passed so-called trigger laws, which would introduce bans immediately upon the court's decision. Less than a third of those states would include exceptions for rape of incest, according to the legislation they have already passed, or are trying to pass.\n\nDemocratic-controlled states like California and New York will cast themselves as abortion sanctuaries, welcoming women from places where the procedure has been outlawed. There are 20 states in all where abortion will remain a protected right. About 26.5 million women of childbearing age live in those states.\n\nAs abortion clinics close down in states that have outlawed the practice many more are expected to open near state borders in places where it is still allowed. Those who don't have the time or money to travel may resort to other means - such as ordering abortion-inducing pills online - even if it is illegal.\n\nThere were somewhere between 600,000 and 800,000 abortions in the US in 2019. According to the Center for Disease Control, about one in six pregnancies end in abortion, and over 90% occur in the first trimester. Over half of women who get abortions are already mothers, and for most, it is their first abortion.\n\nThe court's decision could not be more timely, as Americans are set to vote for their representatives in Congress later this year.\n\nFacing a thrashing in November's elections, the Democrats hope the abortion issue will galvanise pro-choice women to come out and vote for them. But they have already failed in their attempt to get Congress to introduce legislation to grant a federal right to abortion, which would have stopped individual states from banning the procedure.\n\nEven if Democrats keep control of the House and Senate, they won't be able to overturn this court ruling.\n\nOn the other side, there are plenty of Republicans who would like to legislate for a federal abortion ban that would outlaw abortion across all states. That may be the coming battle if Republicans take control of Congress after the next election.\n\nFurther fights may be had over how this ruling affects certain types of contraception or IVF treatment. And some have questioned whether similar legal arguments can be used to undermine same-sex marriage.\n\nAmerica today feels like one country that contains two very separate nations, inhabited by two tribes that have completely different values, beliefs and goals. Now, they have just moved farther apart.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Abortion: What does overturn of Roe v Wade mean?\n\nThe US Supreme Court has opened the door for individual states to ban or severely restrict the ability for pregnant women to get abortions.\n\nIn 1973, the court had ruled in Roe v Wade that pregnant women were entitled to an abortion during the first three months of their pregnancy, while allowing for legal restrictions and bans in the second and third trimester.\n\nNow the court has overturned that earlier ruling, effectively making it possible for states to ban abortions earlier than 12 weeks.\n\nAbortion will not automatically become illegal in the US - but individual states will now be allowed to decide if and how to allow abortions.\n\nThirteen states had passed \"trigger laws\" that come into effect upon Roe v Wade being overturned. Others have left old laws on the books that banned abortion prior to 1973 - they could now go back into force.\n\nIn the days that followed the ruling, several bans came into force, but some of those have been temporarily blocked by the courts, setting things up for further legal battles.\n\nOver the past decade, several states have also tried to pass laws making abortion illegal, except in a few circumstances such as if the pregnant woman's life is at risk. Some of those laws were struck down by lower courts, as they appeared to violate Roe v Wade. But now they will likely come back into force.\n\nIn total more than 20 states are making moves to limit access to abortion, according to Guttmacher. Some states intend to ban abortion from the moment of conception, while others are introducing bans at six or more weeks.\n\nAll states allow abortion to save the life of the mother, while some will also allow exceptions to their ban for cases of rape or incest.\n\nMost have said they will not prosecute women for trying to end their pregnancy, reserving criminal penalties for abortion providers and others who try and help women get abortions.\n\nHere's a look at what could happen in those states now that Roe v Wade has been overturned.\n\nSome 40 million women of child-bearing age will live in states where abortion will become more difficult to access, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research organisation that supports abortion rights.\n\nAbout 630,000 abortions were performed in the US in 2019, according to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), although Guttmacher's own research indicates it may be closer to 860,000.\n\nThe CDC says that the vast majority of abortions, 92.8%, are performed during the first trimester. Most people who get abortions are unmarried, although they may be living with a partner at the time. About one in 10 women who get an abortion are teenagers, with most being in their 20s. About 60% of people who get abortions have also given birth before, and nearly 60% had never had an abortion before.\n\nState-specific statistics in the interactive table above are from 2017, the most recent date for which data is available from Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute's 2014 Abortion Patient Survey still provides the most recent national overview on the social and economic background of those having abortions in the US. However, changes in the US economy and access to abortion over the last eight years means the picture could have changed.\n\nUpdate: Language in this story has been amended to more accurately reflect the specifics of the Roe v Wade ruling.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: Thousands march to White House for abortion rights\n\nThousands gathered in the US capital on Saturday, marching through pouring rain and risking arrest to protest over the reversal of abortion rights last month.\n\nThe demonstration came two weeks after the Supreme Court repealed Roe v Wade - the ruling that had guaranteed abortion access nationwide for nearly 50 years.\n\nChanting \"we won't go back\", protesters converged on the White House, with some tying themselves to the gates outside.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people gathered from across the US, organisers said.\n\nLauren Pierce, 33, an attorney from Dallas, was among them, travelling some 1,300 miles (2,100km) to attend the demonstration.\n\n\"There's nothing, to me, more worth fighting for than this cause - our fundamental right to have bodily autonomy,\" she said. \"If that means taking up space and getting arrested then I think it's worth it.\"\n\nMs Pierce's home state of Texas is among the 10 US states where abortion has already been prohibited. At least a dozen other states are expected to follow.\n\nAnti-abortion campaigners, many of whom see abortion as \"murder\", have celebrated the court's decision and the opportunity to outlaw the procedure in large swathes of the country.\n\nMs Pierce said she had begun to hear of Texans who have found themselves suddenly without reproductive care. The average one-way driving distance for a person in Texas seeking an abortion in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is now 250 miles, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group.\n\n\"We're blocked in,\" she said.\n\nMs Pierce, like many others gathered at the White House, expressed frustration with President Joe Biden and his administration for not doing more to protect abortion access. Indeed, during Saturday's event organised by the Women's March, mention of Mr Biden's Democratic party drew nearly as many jeers as did mention of the Republicans.\n\nOn Friday, facing pressure from progressives, Mr Biden signed an executive order directing his health department to protect abortion care, including access to medication abortion and emergency contraception, and safeguards for patient privacy.\n\nBut the president's power is limited. He cannot force through legislation in Congress and he cannot undo the decision of the Supreme Court, now a 6-3 conservative supermajority.\n\n\"We know there are limits to his authority, but we want him to push that authority to its limit,\" said Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of the Women's March.\n\nStill, Ms Carmona said the order was an important first step.\n\n\"We're calling on President Biden to continue to take steps to protect abortion nationally,\" she said. \"And if he can't do anything more from behind his desk he should get out into the streets.\"\n\nBut to many pro-choice advocates, Mr Biden's administration has failed to meet the moment after a historic reversal in women's rights.\n\n\"This is the first time ever a constitutional right has been taken away,\" said Helen Miller, 56, from Virginia. \"We're here for our daughters, our children, our lives.\"\n\nSome 40 million women of reproductive age are expected to lose access to abortion in the coming weeks.\n\nJoanne Morris, 75, took in Saturday's protest from her hot pink wheelchair, holding a cardboard sign. \"This boomer believes in choice and freedom,\" it said.\n\nStanding with her daughter, Lisa, Ms Morris said she had travelled from Pennsylvania for her 16-year-old granddaughter.\n\n\"I want to see her have the same choices that I had,\" she said.\n\nMs Morris, a retired nurse, was 26 when the Supreme Court recognised a federal right to an abortion. She said she didn't believe she would live to see Roe fall. \"It feels like the country is headed in the wrong direction,\" she said.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "US Supreme Court: The woman who helped to end Roe v Wade\n\nMillions of women in the US will lose the legal right to abortion, after the Supreme Court overturned a 50-year-old ruling that legalised it nationwide. Before the court's ruling was made public, BBC News looked at the woman whose case brought about the historic decision.\n\nIn September 2021, Mississippi's chief legal officer sat down for an interview with Pro-Life Weekly, a Catholic television programme featuring anti-abortion activists.\n\nLynn Fitch looked how she almost always does during public appearances: dyed-blonde hair blow-dried straight and neat, tasteful jewellery and a monochrome suit, this time in powder blue.\n\nThe attorney general was there to celebrate. The United States Supreme Court had just announced the date it would hear her state's challenge to Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that has, for the nearly 50 years since, served as a nationwide guarantee to abortion access.\n\nThe case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, centres on a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. Under Ms Fitch's direction, the state asked the Supreme Court to uphold the law and slash the landmark Roe v Wade decision in the process. A ruling is expected this month. A leaked draft suggests it is likely that Mississippi's ban will be upheld, paving the way for other states to also outlaw abortion.\n\nMs Fitch - who declined to be interviewed - had argued that overturning Roe v Wade would be \"game-changing\", \"uplifting\" women by eliminating what she described as a false choice between family and career.\n\n\"Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,\" she said on Pro-Life Weekly. \"You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well.\"\n\nIf she wins the case, and Roe v Wade falls, some 40 million women may lose access to abortion, pro-choice advocates warn. It could also make Ms Fitch, a single working parent of three, a Republican superstar and poster-child for her own argument: modern women don't need abortion to have it all.\n\nAbortion was not always an animating theme of Ms Fitch's political career. When she first took public office, as Mississippi state treasurer in 2011, she pushed for legislation that would guarantee men and women were paid equally.\n\nHer convictions were shaped in many ways by her upbringing, and her experiences as a single mother, says Hayes Dent, a long-time friend and colleague, who ran her first political campaign.\n\nWhen Mr Dent first met Ms Fitch, she had just been named executive director of the Mississippi State Personnel Board, a state agency, by then-governor Haley Barbour. Mr Dent was immediately impressed.\n\n\"Having been around every major political figure in Mississippi for 40 years, I could just tell: she's going to run,\" Mr Dent said. \"And when she pulls that trigger, she's going to be successful.\"\n\nIt wasn't for another couple of years that she did, launching a campaign for state treasurer.\n\nWhen he launched her first political campaign, for state treasurer in 2011, \"she was an underdog,\" said Austin Barbour, a national GOP strategist and the nephew of former Governor Barbour.\n\nMr Dent, who had kept tabs on Ms Fitch, reached out to her in the middle of that 2011 cycle and asked to come on board her campaign.\n\n\"I said 'Look, I think you can win this race,'\" he recalled.\n\nShe accepted. The two would drive the length of the state in a day, making a handful of different stops and placing fundraiser calls in the hours between.\n\n\"Her attitude was 'what is the task at hand,'\" Mr Dent said. \"It'd be like 'Look, we've gotta go to the tobacco spitting festival.' And she'd do great! She wouldn't spit tobacco, but she was great.\"\n\nThe only reason Ms Fitch would turn down a campaign event was her kids, cutting out early to make a school basketball game or parent-teacher conference.\n\nShe was a natural campaigner, but fundraising lagged. Mr Dent drove to northern Mississippi to ask her father for a personal donation.\n\nBill Fitch still lived in Holly Springs, the small, rural town near the state's northern edge where Ms Fitch spent most of her childhood.\n\nHer father had inherited land on the historic Galena Plantation and used the sprawling 8,000-acre property to restore the family farm, turning it into a premier quail hunting destination. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and Mississippi governors Barbour and Phil Bryant, became frequent guests.\n\nVisitors of Fitch Farms could elect to stay in the former home of Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, which Mr Fitch had bought and transported onto the property.\n\nMs Fitch has told local media of \"special\" childhood memories at her father's farm, riding horses and hunting quail.\n\nAs a teenager, she was the \"prototypical popular girl\", Mr Dent said. \"Leader, cheerleader, athletic, the whole nine yards,\" he said.\n\nShe went to the University of Mississippi, joined a sorority and graduated with a degree in business administration and later in law.\n\nWhen Mr Dent drove to her father's farm to make his pitch for a campaign donation, he said it painly: \"I told him if I left there with a big cheque, she was going to win\".\n\nShe won, and then won again four years later, securing a second term as state treasurer.\n\nIn this office, she targeted state debt, expanded access to financial education in the state, and advocated for equal pay laws (Mississippi remains the only state that does not ensure equal pay for equal work between men and women).\n\nAnd she developed her knack for connecting to voters, leaning on both her Holly Springs upbringing and an apparent ease in the public eye.\n\nIn interviews and campaign videos, Ms Fitch looks preternaturally poised. She makes easy eye contact, her speech slow and relaxed, often thanking God and her family for the opportunity to serve her state.\n\n\"Rural roots matter to voters in this state,\" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. \"And she's very likeable, she just is.\"\n\nMs Fitch also helped bolster her conservative credentials with her support for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, leading Mississippi's Women for Trump coalition in 2016. When Mr Trump was in Jackson for a campaign rally, she sat in the front row.\n\nTwo years later, Ms Fitch announced she would make a bid for Mississippi Attorney General - an office that had never been held by a woman.\n\nBut she wasn't the underdog this time, gliding to victory in November 2019 with nearly 60% of the vote on a promise to uphold \"conservative values and principles\".\n\nAs a devoted Republican in a solidly Republican state, where Ms Fitch stood on abortion was taken as given, even if she didn't run on it.\n\nAcross the country, about 60% of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to data from the Pew Research Centre. But among Mississippi Republicans, nearly 70% believe abortion should illegal in all or most cases.\n\n\"You don't run in Mississippi, you don't run in rural conservative states and not want to see Roe v Wade overturned,\" said Mr Barbour, the Republican strategist. \"It's just ingrained\".\n\nThe abortion ban before the Supreme Court was passed by Mississippi's state legislature in 2018, two years before Ms Fitch took office as Attorney General. The law, which bans abortions outright after 15 weeks, was immediately challenged in court on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi's last remaining abortion clinic.\n\nA federal district court struck down the ban, saying it was unconstitutional. In 2019, an appeals court upheld this decision.\n\nBut in June 2020, five months into the job, Attorney General Fitch petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the 15-week ban. The court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, accepted and heard the case in December of last year.\n\nNow, she's known nationally as the lawyer expected to topple Roe v Wade.\n\nAt times, Ms Fitch has said her state is merely making an argument for the rule of law: asking the Supreme Court to turn over abortion policymaking to the states. But more often, she says the case is about women's empowerment.\n\nRoe v Wade, she has said, made women believe they had to pick: family or career, not both.\n\n\"The court in Roe pitted women against our children, and woman against woman,\" she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.\n\nThe choice is misleading and paternalistic, argued Ms Fitch. It's a position seemingly drawn from her own life: a single mother who has ascended to the highest levels of state office, while remaining devoted to her children and grandchildren.\n\n\"Being a single mom has sort of dominated her thought process, and her life experience,\" Mr Dent said. \"I think that's one of the reasons she feels so strongly about this\".\n\nIn a world without Roe v Wade, Ms Fitch said during a television interview last year, \"babies will be saved\" and mothers \"get a chance to really redirect their lives. They have all these new and different opportunities that they didn't have 50 years ago\".\n\nPro-choice activists have accused Ms Fitch of using feminist language to cover over an inherently anti-feminist policy.\n\nHer arguments lean \"heavily into false claims that they are 'empowering women'\", said Dina Montemarano, research director for NARAL Pro-Choice America. This tactic, Ms Montemarano said, is often used by anti-abortion activists to assert control over women's bodies and violate their fundamental freedoms.\n\nIn an opening brief submitted to the Supreme Court, Ms Fitch wrote of \"sweeping policy advancements [which] now promote women's full pursuit of both career and family\".\n\nBut in a counter-argument submitted to the Supreme Court, 154 economists warned that this optimism was \"premature and false\".\n\n\"Mississippi's celebration of parental leave policies is particularly bizarre, as the United States is one of only two countries without a national paid maternity leave policy,\" the economists wrote.\n\nMississippi, specifically, has no state laws mandating paid family leave. It is the poorest state in the nation and has the highest rates of both infant mortality and child poverty.\n\nBut if Roe is indeed thrown out, Ms Fitch will return to Mississippi a conservative hero.\n\n\"I'm 99% sure she will run for attorney general again,\" Mr Dent said. \"And based on how the last three years have gone, it's hard for me to imagine she'll have any Republican opposition this time\".\n\nThere are also early rumblings that she may one day run for governor. She has not yet commented on this speculation.\n\nIf she wins, Ms Fitch would be the first female governor in Mississippi's history.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Roe v Wade: Biden calls for federal law to restore abortion rights\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said a federal law would be the \"fastest way\" to restore abortion rights as he signed an order to safeguard abortion access.\n\nHe called a recent Supreme Court abortion ruling, which ended the nationwide right to the procedure, \"an exercise in raw political power\".\n\nIt paved the way for individual US states to decide if and how to allow abortions.\n\nMr Biden has faced pressure to respond to the ruling with bolder action.\n\nThe presidential order, signed on Friday, is expected to have a limited impact - to mitigate some of the restrictions but not fully restore abortion rights.\n\nMr Biden has maintained that his ability to institute abortion rights is limited without action from the US Congress.\n\n\"The fastest route to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe,\" Mr Biden said, referring to the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nIn his remarks, he emphasised this was an issue for the coming midterm elections and urged people to vote in Democratic majorities as the fastest way to bring Roe V Wade back, and said that US voters had a choice between \"the mainstream or the extreme\".\n\nHe also pointed to a recent news report that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was forced to travel to  a neighbouring state to have an abortion after she was sexually abused.\n\n\"Imagine being a little girl. Just imagine being a little girl, 10 years old. Does anyone believe that?\" he said.\n\nMr Biden's new executive order beefs up protection against potential penalties that women seeking abortion may face if they travel across state lines for the procedure, and protects access to contraception.\n\nIt includes measures to safeguard access to abortion medication.\n\nThe order also takes additional steps to protect patient privacy, including by addressing the transfer and sales of sensitive health-related data, combatting digital surveillance related to reproductive health care services.\n\nA White House official warned that women should be wary of apps that track their menstrual periods after the rollback of federal abortion rights.\n\n\"I think people should be really careful about that,\" Jen Klein, the director of the White House's Gender Policy Council said Friday, when asked whether the administration recommended that women delete such apps.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has published \"practical instructions on how to delete certain apps that are  on your phone\" she added.\n\nMr Biden's executive order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to submit a report within 30 days on those efforts.\n\nHe is also directing the attorney general and White House counsel to convene private volunteer attorneys and public interest organisations to encourage legal representation for those seeking or offering reproductive health services.\n\nSince the Supreme Court abortion ruling nearly two weeks ago, at least nine states have instituted a near-total ban on the procedure, with the only exception being danger to the life of the mother.\n\nOther states are now scrambling to protect abortion access amid legal challenges, while abortion clinics are struggling to navigate patchworks of new laws.\n\nEver since the Supreme Court handed down its decision discarding Roe v Wade, abortion rights activists have been calling on Joe Biden to do more.\n\nThe US president's initial reaction, an expression of sadness at the ruling and a call to vote Democratic in November's midterm elections, was viewed by many as simply inadequate.\n\nWhispers that Mr Biden was not up to the moment, either because of advancing age or political disposition, have grown to the point that they couldn't be ignored by the White House.\n\nPresidential power on abortion is limited, however, particularly given the long-time congressional provisions that prohibit the federal government from spending funds to support the procedure - provisions that Mr Biden himself once backed.\n\nThat leaves the president in a bind.\n\nOpinion polling indicates that the public widely support maintaining the legality of abortion, even in states that have bans already on the books. But any sweeping measures Mr Biden may take will face quick legal challenge, and the support for presidential action - from the American people at large, if not from his restive liberal base - may diminish if the public views the White House as exceeding its powers.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

They only see the wins,\" Wade says. \"I understood that as an athlete and I understand that as a businessman. There's so many days that nobody's patting you on the back.

Now, as he pursues a number of post-retirement ventures , Wade sees up-and-coming stars like Caitlin Clark earning millions and hopes they get off to a better start than he did.\n\n\"It's really amazing that they're having access to this money so young, but you're also kind of fearful not knowing who they have around them that know about money,\" says Wade, who spoke to CNBC Make It while promoting a partnership with Google Workspace .\n\nIt's a sense of protectiveness that comes from experience. Wade, who was drafted by the Miami Heat when he was 21, says that it took him more than half a decade in the NBA \"to even start to understand\" how to manage his millions.\n\n\"I came into the league as someone who had never really handled more than $500 at a time, and [suddenly] I'm making millions of dollars,\" Wade says. Knowing who to take money advice from was difficult when he himself knew \"nothing at all\" about the subject.\n\n\"It's not that I didn't have good people around me,\" he says. \"It's that no one was making the level of money that I was making. To be able to know what to do, you have to be with people who are on the level that you're on. And I didn't do that.\"\n\nThe 42-year-old tells Make It he hopes the latest crop of newly-minted millionaire basketball players make a concerted effort to educate themselves right at the start.\n\n\"You have to find someone that you trust and admire that does well with their money,\" he says. \"You are capable, because of your status and where you are, to be able to reach out to those individuals. Get a call with them. Ask them how and what to do with your money and how to spend your money and how to think about the money that you have.\"\n\nWade says one of the biggest mistakes he made early on in his career was being too proud to ask for help. And even when he did get financial advice, he was so unfamiliar with the financial basics that \"I don't know if I even understood how to listen.\"\n\nHe added that it can be difficult to ask for help and admit that you're uneducated about a certain topic.\n\n\"You don't want people to think less of you because you don't know something like how much money you have or what to do with your money,\" he says.\n\nUltimately, Wade hopes that the leagues employing the stars of tomorrow make a concerted effort to make sure their players are armed with the information necessary to make smart financial decisions for themselves.\n\n\"We talk about wanting athletes to have the opportunity to have generational wealth,\" he says. \"This is where it starts.\"\n\nWant to make extra money outside of your day job?

As a player, Wade valued his physical fitness above all. In retirement, he has focused more on his overall wellness, including his mental health and time spent in solitude .\n\n\"I feel like I'm in better shape now than I was actually as a player. I was very muscular, but I didn't take care of my body in the way that I should've because I didn't have the knowledge,\" he says.\n\n\"I care more about [my daily wellness practices],\" Wade adds. \"I understand their importance.\"\n\nWade and his son, Zaire, 21, who's a professional basketball player in the Basketball Africa League, recently launched a partnership with wellness company Thorne to incorporate more healthy practices into their lives for longevity.\n\nAfter retiring in 2019, Wade no longer had the day-to-day medical advice that was built into his work as an NBA player. As a result, he found himself experiencing aches and pains more often.\n\n\"I had to go out and find my own information. I was looking for the things that could help me perform in all of the ways that I need to perform as someone who still looks at himself as an athlete. But I'm aging,\" says Wade.\n\nNow, Wade likes to start his mornings with meditation. \"We should all have a moment of silence for ourselves,\" he says.\n\nAnd though other former athletes happily give up the gym once they retire, Wade still likes to keep in shape, joking that he's \"a narcissist about how I look.\" The 2006 NBA Finals MVP sticks to a strict training routine.\n\n\"No matter what time it is, I get up every day, I get downstairs and I get to work,\" he says. \"I feel like it's good to get that heart rate up [and] challenge yourself in the gym.\"\n\nAfter his workout, Wade gets in the steam room and uses a cold tub to help his body recover. Then Wade, who says he \"doesn't eat a lot of vegetables,\" takes his daily greens supplements from Thorne.\n\nSince learning what works for him, Wade's routine has evolved from when he was in his 20s.\n\n\"I have my whole line-up in a sense,\" he says of his multi-step morning routine. \"I'm a person who believes in that.

Still, he finds time to honor his commitments inside of his home despite his demanding schedule.\n\nHis biggest piece of advice for parents, that he keeps at the forefront of his mind, is being present for your children when they need you.\n\n\"I just try to show up.

      "text": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, ending 50 years of federal abortion rights\n\nThe Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision on Friday overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion in the U.S. in 1973.\n\nThe court's controversial but expected ruling gives individual states the power to set their own abortion laws without concern of running afoul of Roe, which had permitted abortions during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFollow live coverage of reaction to abortion decision here\n\nAlmost half the states are expected to outlaw or severely restrict abortion as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, which is related to a highly restrictive new Mississippi abortion law. The laws will affect tens of millions of people around the country, who may have to cross state lines to seek reproductive health care.\n\nOther states plan to maintain more liberal rules governing the termination of pregnancies.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights immediately condemned the ruling, while abortion opponents praised a decision they had long hoped for and worked to ensure. Protesters descended on the Supreme Court on Friday to speak out both for and against a decision that will upend decades of precedent in the U.S.\n\nRead the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade here\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, as expected, wrote the majority opinion that tossed out Roe as well as a 1992 Supreme Court decision upholding abortion rights in a case known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nAlito was joined in that judgment by four other conservatives on the high court . Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the Mississippi abortion restrictions but did not approve of overturning Roe altogether.\n\nThe majority also included three justices appointed by former President Donald Trump : Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThe court's three liberal justices filed a dissenting opinion to the ruling , which quickly drew protestors to the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" Alito wrote.\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely - the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Alito wrote.\n\n\"That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" he added.\n\n\"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives,\" Alito wrote.\n\nIn their scathing joint dissent, the court's liberal justices wrote, \"The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law.\"\n\n\"The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman's rights to equality and freedom,\" said the dissent by Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\n\"Today's Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a woman's control of her body and the path of her life,\" it said. \"A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.\"\n\nIn a concurring opinion with the majority ruling, the conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that in light of the rationale for overturning Roe, the Supreme Court should reconsider its rulings in three other past cases which established a right to use birth control, and which said there is a constitutional right for gay people to have sex and marry one another.\n\nFriday's bombshell decision came a day after the Supreme Court in another controversial ruling invalidated a century-old New York law that had made it very difficult for people to obtain a license to carry a gun outside of their homes.\n\nThe case that triggered Roe's demise, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, is related to a Mississippi law that banned nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDobbs was by far the most significant and controversial dispute of the court's term.\n\nIt also posed the most serious threat to abortion rights since Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe.\n\nDobbs deepened partisan divisions in a period of already intense political tribalism.\n\nThe early May leak of a draft of the majority opinion , which completely overturned Roe, sent shockwaves across the country and galvanized activists on both sides of the debate. It also cast a pall over the nation's highest court, which immediately opened an investigation to find the source of the leak.\n\nThe publication of the court's draft opinion, written by Alito, sparked protests from abortion-rights supporters, who were outraged and fearful about how the decision will impact both patients and providers as 22 states gear up to restrict abortions or ban them outright.\n\nThe leaked opinion marked a major victory for conservatives and anti-abortion advocates who had worked for decades to undermine Roe and Casey, which the majority of Americans support keeping in place.\n\nBut Republican lawmakers in Washington, who are hoping to win big in the November midterm elections, initially focused more on the leak itself than on what it revealed. They also decried the protests that formed outside the homes of some conservative justices, accusing activists of trying to intimidate the court.\n\nThe unprecedented leak of Alito's draft opinion blew a hole in the cloak of secrecy normally shrouding the court's internal affairs. It drew harsh scrutiny from the court's critics, many of whom were already concerned about the politicization of the country's most powerful deliberative body, where justices are appointed for life.\n\nRoberts vowed that the work of the court \"will not be affected in any way\" by the leak, which he described as a \"betrayal\" intended to \"undermine the integrity of our operations.\"\n\nThe leak had clearly had an impact, however. Tall fencing was set up around the court building afterward, and Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshals Service to \"help ensure the Justices' safety.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump Georgia election special prosecutor quits, salvaging case after judge's order\n\nSpecial prosecutor Nathan Wade will step down from the sprawling Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants, salvaging the case after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled Friday that either Wade or District Attorney Fani Willis must remove themselves.\n\n\"I hereby offer my resignation, effective immediately,\" Wade wrote in a letter to Willis Friday obtained by NBC News. He added that he was resigning \"to move this case forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWade's announcement followed a decision from McAfee earlier in the day that represented a middle ground, following the bombshell revelation that Willis and Wade were engaged in a romantic relationship for more than a year while the case was being investigated and prosecuted. Accounts of precisely when the relationship began differed significantly.\n\nThe Friday decision and Wade's subsequent announcement came just two days after McAfee dismissed six counts from Willis' case - including three against Trump - ruling that the basis for those charges was insufficiently explained. Those counts had accused Trump and five other defendants of the crime of solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer. McAfee left the door open for the charges to be refiled.\n\nOne of Trump's co-defendants first called to disqualify Willis in January from prosecuting the case against the former president and his co-defendants for allegedly trying to overturn President Joe Biden 's victory in Georgia's 2020 election.\n\nMultiple other defendants, including Trump, joined the bid to dismiss the indictment and remove Willis on conflict-of-interest grounds. The defendants also called to disqualify Wade.\n\n\"While respecting the Court's decision, we believe that the Court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said Friday in response to the initial McAfee ruling.\n\n\"We will use all legal options available as we continue to fight to end this case, which should never have been brought in the first place,\" he said.\n\nOne of those options will be to file a certificate of review, Pete Skandalakis, the head of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, said in a statement to NBC News. The certificate would provide the defense with a means to appeal the decision, he added.\n\nWillis and Wade admitted to the relationship only after it was first alleged in January court filings for defendant Michael Roman. These filings claimed the D.A. and the prosecutor engaged in an \"improper, clandestine personal relationship\" and that they profited off the arrangement at taxpayers' expense.\n\nBut both Willis and Wade insisted their relationship posed neither a personal nor financial conflict, and Willis has decried related claims as \"fantastical theories and rank speculation.\"\n\nIn a volatile hearing in mid-February, Willis tore into Ashleigh Merchant, the defense lawyer who first surfaced the relationship allegations.\n\nOn the witness stand, both Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship did not become romantic until after he joined the election interference case in November 2021.\n\nWillis' 98-page, 41-count indictment initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, pleaded not guilty to the charges. A number of Trump's co-defendants have already struck plea deals in the case.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade will financially hurt the 'most marginalized' women, experts say\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade may cause financial hardship for many women, especially those already facing economic instability, research shows.\n\nThe ruling Friday ends almost 50 years of federal abortion rights. It allows individual states to set their own laws, and nearly half the states are expected to outlaw or severely restrict abortion as a result.\n\n\"It sadly affects the most marginalized women - women of color and people who are economically unable to access abortion,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a Jacksonville, Florida-based certified financial planner, physician and founder of Life Planning Partners.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Here's what you can expect in a typical recession How to save money at the pump, with or without a federal gas tax holiday Proposed changes to retirement system get approval from Senate committee\n\nWhile wealthier women living in states with abortion bans may still travel to other states for the procedure, those with fewer resources may not have that option, said McClanahan, who is also a member of CNBC's Advisor Council .\n\nCaitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who three years ago started modeling the effects of Roe v. Wade being overturned, emphasized that many of the women most severely affected already have children.\n\nMore than 150 other economists and researchers, including Myers, filed an amicus brief with the courts showing the connection between women's access to abortion and economic opportunity.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court's majority opinion briefly addresses how overturning Roe v. Wade may affect women's lives, it concludes the court can't predict the impact, Myers said.\n\n\"That just ignores an enormous body of credible and rigorous scientific research,\" she said, pointing to recent evidence from the Turnaway study , which tracked nearly 1,000 women seeking an abortion at 30 clinics across the U.S. from 2008 to 2010.\n\nThese women's finances were trending similarly \"until that crucial moment\" when some who wanted abortions were turned away, she said. For those who were denied an abortion and gave birth, the result was years of financial hardship, the study found .\n\nAmong those denied an abortion, there was an increase in household poverty for at least four years relative to those who had an abortion. Years later, the women denied an abortion were more likely to lack the money to cover basic living expenses such as food, housing and transportation.\n\nWhat's more, being denied an abortion lowered these women's credit scores, boosted their debt and increased negative financial records, such as bankruptcies and evictions, the study found.\n\nWhile the right to abortion may remain legal in more than half the states, \"the impact would be absolutely enormous\" if it's banned nationwide, Myers said.\n\n\"This is a big setback for women's rights, both from a health and an economic standpoint,\" McClanahan added.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "'I'm outraged:' Women react to Roe v. Wade ruling outside of Supreme Court\n\nWASHINGTON - Politely sidestepping through a crowd of hundreds gathered outside the nation's highest court, a group of teenage girls hoisted their hastily-made posters in the air and joined in the chants.\n\nSome of them admitted that they have never visited the nation's capital before and others shared that they have never been part of a protest.\n\n\"We saw what happened this morning with the overturning of Roe and we just decided to use our time and use our voices,\" explained 16-year-old Kayliegh Ko.\n\nKo, who traveled from North Carolina, came to D.C. for a week-long program designed to give students an opportunity to advocate on policy issues with lawmakers.\n\n\"We were presenting our position on reproductive rights to Congressmen and then we looked at our phones and said, 'Oh my God, the Supreme Court just issued its ruling on Roe.'\"\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling, the nation's highest court tossed out Roe v. Wade , the landmark law that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in the United States in 1973. The decision is expected to lead to nearly half of U.S. states outlawing or severely restricting the medical procedure and will affect tens of millions of people.\n\nFollowing the ruling, supporters and opponents of the decision gathered outside the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I'm f---ing angry, this is not right,\" added 15-year-old Jetia, who traveled from the Birmingham, Alabama region to Washington, D.C. \"This is my first protest and I'm so happy to see that there are so many people out here supporting our rights,\" she added.\n\n\"We don't know what else is on the chopping block,\" added Noelle Gonzales Jackson, 15, from Maryland.\n\n\"We have all been very open with each other about this normally private issue,\" she said, holding a sign she made with her eyeliner en route to the protest.\n\n\"I'm outraged,\" Koyuki Chance, 45, told CNBC outside the Supreme Court. \"This decision cannot stand,\" added the Philadelphia native.\n\n\"In order for women and birthing people to live full lives as human beings they must have self-determination and that cannot happen if abortion is illegal,\" added Chance, a mother to a daughter.\n\nOn the heels of the Supreme Court decision, President Joe Biden pledged to take every step possible to protect abortion rights during an address from the White House .\n\n\"It's a sad day for our country but it doesn't mean the fight is over,\" he said, urging Americans to elect more pro-choice lawmakers in the House and Senate in November's midterm elections. \"We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land. We need to elect officials who will do that,\" Biden said.\n\n\"This is not over,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked if Friday's Supreme Court decision would compel her to vote for pro-abortion rights lawmakers in the midterm elections, Chance said she wasn't worried about November.\n\n\"I'm worried about the women in Arkansas,\" Chance said, referring to one of the states where abortion is no longer accessible and if performed is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The only exception is if the mother's life is in danger from the pregnancy.\n\n\"I'm not worried about November because right now women are being forced into motherhood,\" she added.\n\nGabrielle Harris, 30, from New York was checking out of her hotel room in Washington, D.C., when she saw the news break on television.\n\nThe day before she was at the White House sponsoring a group that advocates for economic opportunities for Black Americans. Harris, a mother to a three-year-old son, explained that access to abortion is not only about bodily autonomy but also about economic security and opportunity.\n\n\"I had a choice when I decided to have him and it was my choice, I had options because having a child and raising a child is a complex decision,' Harris told CNBC.\n\n\"And I took weeks to decide because I had to consider several situations, one of which was my economic situation and family and government support,\" she added.\n\nLooking up at the Supreme Court and holding a sign that says \"Stop the war on women,\" Harris read the words engraved on the West Pediment, above the front entrance of the Supreme Court aloud: \"Equal justice under the law.\"\n\n\"Okay, there's no justice and it's definitely not equal,\" she said. \"This decision has no balance, no consideration of human rights and no equity,\" Harris added.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Ex-Fulton County Prosecutor Nathan Wade Suggests He Had Multiple White House Meetings\n\nFormer Fulton County, Georgia special prosecutor Nathan Wade suggested to House lawmakers that he met with White House officials on several occasions during the county's lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, but did not remember the details.\n\nEarlier this year, Wade resigned from his position after a judge ordered that either he or Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would have to leave the sweeping election-related case against Trump and more than a dozen co-defendants. The judge handed down the order after both Wade and Willis had confirmed the pair were in a relationship.\n\nThe Republican-led House Judiciary Committee interviewed Wade earlier this month in its investigation into Willis's and Wade's relationship, and whether the two financially benefitted from the arrangement.

      "text": "Ex-Fulton County Prosecutor Nathan Wade Suggests He Had Multiple White House Meetings\n\nFormer Fulton County, Georgia special prosecutor Nathan Wade suggested to House lawmakers that he met with White House officials on several occasions during the county's lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, but did not remember the details.\n\nEarlier this year, Wade resigned from his position after a judge ordered that either he or Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would have to leave the sweeping election-related case against Trump and more than a dozen co-defendants. The judge handed down the order after both Wade and Willis had confirmed the pair were in a relationship.\n\nThe Republican-led House Judiciary Committee interviewed Wade earlier this month in its investigation into Willis's and Wade's relationship, and whether the two financially benefitted from the arrangement. In a court hearing earlier this year, both Wade and Willis denied they profited and disputed allegations saying they were in a relationship before Wade was hired on as special prosecutor.\n\nAt one point, according to a transcript released by the committee, Wade was asked about an invoice that read, \"Travel to Athens; conf with White House counsel, May 23rd, 2022.\"\n\nWade said that the semicolon that was placed after \"travel to Athens\" was a separate thought.

      "text": "We knew it was coming and yet it still feels like a shock. Yesterday the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nI spent the day reading through the 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization and trying to tune out the noise on Twitter, though it's hard. I saw on social media that gay marriage and maybe even contraception were next on the chopping block, and I frantically texted a judge I know hoping for clarity and comfort. It's a good weekend to take a deep breath and stay offline. Read the decision for yourself, not through the manic lens of Twitter.\n\nWhat's clear is that this decision heralds a new era in American politics. In the country's 13 states with trigger laws, including Texas and Alabama and Missouri and Tennessee, abortion is already or will very soon be illegal. In six other states, governors and state legislatures are expected to impose new restrictions. And in another 10, new restrictions are on the table. Dramatic change, which will alter the lives of American women and their families, is sweeping more than half the states in the union.\n\nThere are so many questions that remain unanswered.\n\nPolitical ones: Will Democrats attempt to pass a national law, in the mold of Ireland or France, legalizing abortion under, say, 14 weeks? Will the kind of violence we have seen against pro-life centers over the past few weeks spread more widely? How will the majority of Americans who opposed the repeal of Roe come to see the Court in the wake of this decision?\n\nPractical ones: What happens when a woman in San Antonio drives to Albuquerque to terminate a pregnancy and the authorities in Texas demand that New Mexico extradite her?\n\nAnd cultural ones: How did we wind up with a feminist movement that is policing our ability to say the word woman, but has been unable to safeguard second-wave feminism's most important victory?\n\nIn the coming days we'll bring you reporting and analysis on such questions.\n\nOne thing I keep thinking about is a piece that Alana Newhouse, the editor in chief of Tablet, wrote for us last year about the urgency of state power-the dawn of a renewed federalism in the 21st century.\n\n\"For decades, a strong federal government was the preferred soldier for me, and for many people I knew,\" she wrote. No longer. In the era of lockdowns and vaccine passports and, especially, the emergence of social credit systems, federal power no longer looked so benign.\n\n\"In the face of this seemingly omnipresent power, where can one find shelter?\" she asked. Her answer: the states. Don't like the lockdowns in Brooklyn? Move to Miami. Don't like the income tax in Los Angeles? Consider Juneau.\n\n\"In ways the founding fathers did not foresee-or did they?-we seem to be facing something quite unexpected. A new era of the states is upon us,\" Alana wrote.\n\nIn many ways the possibilities of that are promising. Covid and crime and school choice have made that abundantly clear. But what meaning does \"the laboratory of the states\" have to the young woman raped in Missouri or Louisiana and unable to afford to travel to a state where abortion is legal?\n\nWe know that some Common Sense readers feel extremely gratified by Dobbs . We know that others are scared and worried about what other rights might be under threat. One of the things we value most about this community is that we have different views about highly divisive subjects. What we share is a commitment to civility, respect and honest conversation. Even-especially-in deeply emotional moments like this one.\n\nThere are those who claim that the time for nonviolence has passed. That desperate times call for desperate measures. That we are in a war and in a war the normal rules of politics must be suspended. These are the same people who turn a blind eye to-or justify-those threatening the lives of Supreme Court justices with whom they disagree. The same people who, in another time, justified violence against abortion providers.\n\nWe could not disagree more strongly with this view.\n\nWe know that it's chic these days to write off virtues like civility and decency and humility and grace. We believe those things are the only way forward. That the only alternative to violence is persuasion and argument.\n\nWe hope that in some small way Common Sense is able to facilitate that exchange, to provide a forum for good-faith argument, to make it easier for people of varying backgrounds and opinions to forge a greater understanding, not with an eye toward papering over our many differences or the profound moral and medical and political implications of yesterday's ruling, but with the hope that that might make living together more possible.\n\nWe think that spirit was captured in two conversations about abortion that we hosted on Honestly. If you take a walk or a drive this weekend, give them a listen:\n\nWhy You're Right-And Wrong-About Abortion. With Caitlin Flanagan.\n\nThe Yale Law Professor Who Is Anti-Roe, But Pro-Choice. With Akhil Amar.\n\nIf you appreciate our efforts to build a community capable of reasoned arguments and good-faith disagreement, please subscribe today:\n\n\"In ways the founding fathers did not foresee-or did they?-we seem to be facing something quite unexpected. A new era of the states is upon us,\" Alana wrote.\n\nThey foresaw it, alright. (See Federalist #45.)\n\nIn fact, if we're thinking of it, you can bet James Madison foresaw it.\n\nRegardless of your personal opinion on the issues, and what legislation you would support, do you truly believe that there is a constitutional right to contraception or gay marriage? The supreme court ruling on these issues would not outlaw them, and given current polling there would be support for national legislation protecting both of these issues. Wouldn't this be the constitutionally correct and politically prudent approach rather than fabricating constitutional rights out of air and opening the door for others to do the same with rights that you might not support?\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Few decisions could inspire so much anger and sadness in one group of Americans-and so much joy and relief in another-than last week's decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Depending on where you sit, the Court just rolled back women's rights by 50 years, or corrected an egregious instance of judicial overreach.\n\nToday, a deep and honest conversation about the Dobbs decision with two women-both mothers-who represent the pro-choice and pro-life sides of this debate.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason Magazine. Bethany Mandel is the editor of the children's series \"Heroes of Liberty.\"\n\nJoining them is the head of the National Constitution Center, Jeffrey Rosen, who the LA Times called the nation's most influential legal commentator.\n\nBari, I've been thinking about how things might have played out the last 50 tears if Roe had been correctly decided. If SOCUS had rolled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, I presume each state would have enacted their own laws governing this issue. We would already be where we are going, but without all the social media rancor. Would love to see a column on this by you and/or a legal historian.\n\nLove what you are doing!\n\nThank-you for the calm and informative debate.  Unfortunately I don't believe in the next few years the debate will be as calm or informative.  The hysteria on both sides is very disheartening.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "America is in the midst of fracturing. For years now, many have been warning about a coming national divorce. The optimists predict a slow slide apart. Others warn darkly of civil war.\n\nWith Friday's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, it's hard not to imagine that that divide-between states, between liberals and conservatives-will grow. Red states for open carry. Blue states for abortion rights. Law firms that exclude members of the Federalist Society. Others that welcome them.\n\nThis Politico tracker shows what abortion laws are right now, state-by-state. It's striking to see what reality is like for women in New York versus women in South Dakota, where there are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, I think states and institutions will continue to polarize. And it will be ugly, as Americans increasingly self-segregate and burrow deeper and deeper into their echo chambers. Not just online, but also in real life.\n\nBut this division will belie the reality of where most citizens actually fall on this particular issue.\n\nWhile the extremes hog the microphone, polling consistently shows that most Americans fall somewhere in the middle on abortion-open to restrictions, but wanting it to remain legal in the first trimester. (Check out 538: What Americans Really Think About Abortion or WSJ: Upholding Roe v. Wade Is Supported by Most Americans .) The most comprehensive and detailed poll about where we fall on abortion comes from Pew and it's worth your time:\n\nRead: America's Abortion Quandary .\n\nCommon Sense reflects that Pew poll. We are a vanishingly rare phenomenon: a community with writers and readers who hold a vast array of beliefs on this topic and so many others. A community of people who is able to hear, in good faith, those we disagree with.\n\nToday we've gathered some of the things we are reading on this subject that we hope challenge you and inspire you to greater empathy.\n\nWe'd love for you to include in the comments any articles, podcasts, or books that you think elevate this conversation.\n\nNo posts"

I listened with bated breath waiting for you and Caitlin to untangle the issue of birth control - the ease of obtaining, evolution of efficacy, forms, and stigma (moms preemptively put their girls on it before going away to college) and how that plays into the modern abortion debate. I am a mom of 3 girls, now young women, and many of us moms did this just like enrolling them in SAT prep. Is protection a socio-economic thing? What about Planned Parenthood - that is free. Why are there so many single black moms? I have a lot of q's. Wishing for a follow-up piece. (Also, I heard about you through Cannon Michael, Nellie's cousin, and I'm so glad I did).\n\nNo posts"

Legalized abortion access has surged in popularity since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. In 2020, half of Americans said it should be legal in all or most cases; by 2024, two-thirds thought so. In the past two years, 11 states approved referendums enshrining permissive abortion laws into their constitutions. Still, in this year's presidential election, half of the people who say abortion should be \"legal in most cases\" voted for Trump. Four years earlier, Joe Biden won those same voters by 38 points.\n\nNo posts"

Actually, it will legalize discrimination-and they're hoping you won't read the fine print.\n\nThis is really scary. The wording, both the abridged and the full, sounds good. Like I would totally vote for it if I lived in NY and didn't see this article. I would bet it passes. It is horribly misleading and scary :(\n\nThis is so depressing. However, reading that language, it seems to me that it could be weaponized in reverse. Because someone who is a biological female can state that they identify as that, and it is a different gender from someone that is a biological male claim to identify as female gender. It protects all on the basis of their identity. All that has to be done is to claim a differentiated gender on the basis of sex, and that biological sex is not gender.\n\nA copy of this article should be sent in the mail to every residence in the State of New York. It's an eye opener. Good job!\n\nthe policy of racial preference to right past wrongs has been in place since the sixties....although the SC said it's not constituional....It might have kept me out of spot at college....because my working class Jewish parents I learned then as now were from a privleged class of white people so I had to do penance for slavery.   if I complained about this in the seventies then I was \"racist.\"  No one at my hs , no counselor ever suggested I try for the Ivy league and financial assistance....so different from the counselors at the HS s at which I taught who were very involved in helping students find a suitable university.....well I got into a good NY State university....on the basis of my grades. took out loans , got work study on campus and worked from HS grad to univr. graduation each summer as my coevals flew to Luxumbourg on Icelandic airway for their summers.  After college grad I got my chance....finally.\n\nIt's amazing how the world is run by Roe vs. Wade and Affirmative Action.  Nothing else matters.\n\nI was standing in line to vote, and I heard more incorrect information being passed amongst people about Proposition 1. Most people had clearly not read the proposition in its complete form, so they were going on knee jerk half-baked or just plain wrong understanding of what a Trojan horse this really is. Shocking how stupid people can be, and how easily they can be led.\n\nMaybe it's a jobs program for lawyers?\n\nI love the \"you're allowed to be racist, but just the good kind of racist\" wording at the end\n\nIf this passes, the people of New York deserve whatever chaos it creates.\n\nIt seems to me the best way to fight such BS is through laws suits alleging child abuse. You can bring over the best experts from Europe, and point out to the judge you are giving them their best chance ever to bring European law into their court room. How could any progressive judge resist such a deal?\n\nThanks for this article!\n\nComments have been inexplicably turned off for the article entitled: \"Is There Really a Plot to Use Migrants to Turn America Blue?\"\n\nIf you want the real story, see this: https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/quantifying-why-democrats-support-open-borders/\n\nComments turn off after a set # of days for all articles\n\n\"...no state shall make or enforce any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities of a United States citizen...\" -14th Amendment.\n\nThat's what the federal judge will point to as he tosses New York's amendment.\n\nThe question will be, does it do so. That would go to the SCOTUS.\n\nPassage of Prop 1 will hasten the exit of sane people from the state of New York.\n\nThey be gettin their reparations.\n\nIf they are black AND GAY. They won't realize that in their haste to stick it to whitey since affirmative racis - I mean action - was robbed from them\n\nUnfortunately, this will probably pass because most voters won't know what's in the fine print.  And if so, it should be struck down by the Supreme Court as Unconstitutional."

Wade effectively ended federal and state laws that required pregnant women to give birth.\"\n\n\"Required to give birth\" is a very funny way of saying, \"not permitted to murder.\"\n\n\" On January 22, 1973, Roe v. Wade effectively ended federal and state laws that required pregnant women to give birth. \"\n\nI stopped reading here. This is a profound example of misdirection which is distracting from the fact that abortion necessitates the execution of a human and instead pretends it is nothing more than liberation for females. If one does not want to give birth, do not have sex. No one is forcing anyone to give birth, we simply ask that you not murder. No one is seeking to control women, we simply ask that you not murder. No one is seeking to take choices from women, we simply ask that you not rob others of their choices by killing them.\n\nI would have loved to keep reading and discover what this article is about but the issue of executing the unborn is the most important issue of our time and anyone who fails to regard it with the same seriousness and urgency is not worth being listened to on any other topic. It is wrong to kill children.\n\n\"...the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill in the 1970s and 1980s in the name of individual rights and dignity...\"\n\nWhy can't/don't folks recognize this is one of the main causes of the homeless crisis?\n\nGrowing the animal in a bag was part of developing methods to help extremely premature babies survive.   You are being paranoid but I agree some nut will take it all that direction.\n\nA missed opportunity to probethe difference between the type of pain where we should build resilience, and the type we can reduce. Instead, this reads like an intro to a paen to pre-scientific approaches where acceptance was our only option.\n\nI think some people aren't clear about the distinction between effort and suffering. I do think alleviating pain is valuable. It's a complex issue.\n\nBefore she drowned, I was married to the perfect woman, perfect mother, and perfect friend. We had six children and she refused even tylenol, not wanting to take the chance an artificial substance which might enter the baby somehow. But women are as different as anything else, and most feel great pain at birth. In general, however, most forget their pains once their infant starts feeding.\n\n______________________________\n\nBut my greater concern is Ms. Boyle's war on pain. I agree percocets were once handed out like candy but the media creation of a mom with a sprained arm becoming \"hooked on oxy\" and then searching the streets for more drugs. The vast majority of overdose deaths are those hooked on fentanyl or heroin far from prescriptions for percocets. Using that statistic as a basis for making it harder for doctors to prescribe pain killing medicines.\n\nThe lawsuits against Perdue and now pharmacies and pharmacists has these businesses less keen to stock needed drugs. At least half a dozen times I have presented legitimate prescriptions to a pharmacy that i used for years, only to find they no longer carry them. I am going through this once again today. I wore a minimal dose fentanyl patch for several years. It has worked well to keep the roller coaster ride of waves of pain better than any I have yet tried. Now the pharmacy cannot get them anymore. When this happened 18 months ago I went to 9 pharmacies for help until i went to one near my doctor's office. Now what? You are not allowed to have more than 30 days supply, Pharmacies legally cannot fill such scripts until time.\n\nAnother instance of those imaging they know better making life worse for common people. I truly hope Ms. Boyle never suffers chronic debilitating pain as it is hard and becoming harder to find medicines that help take the edge off. Yes, doctors never give enough to make the pain go all the way away. Only enough to make life bearable.\n\nI really don't care if I become addicted to something which makes me feel better. People take medications for their heart, blood pressure, diabetes, etc., so why not for pain. Only those with years-long chronic pain understand. Oh, well.\n\nA lot of BS here.  I hurt my back 25 years ago in the army.  I live in pain pretty much every day.\n\nIf I ever find a way to fix that I'm going to do so right away.\n\nAlso, caring a child is REALLY hard on the body, and for many women will cause permanent problems.   For a lot of women that tradeoff might be worth it.  But for many women it won't be.\n\nPeople need to make up their own minds.\n\nLife will give us plenty of suffering to go through.\n\nBrilliant! Thank you, particularly for those last questions every one of us should analyze and resolve.\n\nPeople are so silly. Anything worth achieving takes experiencing discomfort and yes, even pain. It's how we grow.\n\nTaken to its logical conclusions, this is an argument against civilization.\n\nThe entire civilizational project is devoted to the alleviation of human suffering. It's why we live in buildings and sow crops into the earth.\n\nDo people grow from the trials and tribulations of life? Sometimes. Does hardship make lives better? It can.\n\nBut it is not necessarily so. And while some may rise above their difficulties, others may be left to flounder in unending misery until the die.\n\nReduce suffering wherever possible. Full stop. You'll still find it everywhere, regardless.\n\nWell said\n\nWe would be remiss if we didn't include the standup comedian Brian Regan's classic \"The Emergency Room\" https://youtu.be/d2Vg3iSd5ms , the famous giving childbirth pain at #9.\n\nWhat a timely read. I will be cross posting this  one. I host a monthly zoom call for my paid subscribers called Monthly Moments where we focus on one area of life and work to become better. This month I'm encouraging my readers to get interested in the darkness. To open up and embrace suffering because without the dark, the light cannot be seen in its full glory. Opposites are necessary. Our obsession with avoiding suffering is exactly what's making us miserable as a society. For anyone who like to listen to the discussion here's the link: https://open.substack.com/pub/eviefatz/p/monthly-moments?r=yw1ci&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post\n\nWe grow through our suffering . We r forged through the fire. We learn from our mistakes and must accept the consequences of our actions. I hate suffering but it's necessary for growth.\n\nA good read is A Brave New World. They create fake wombs and women no longer give birth. There is no family . If u feel stressed u get a soma holiday .  Free love for all but they all remain children.\n\nExcellent, thought provoking essay. Although cliched, there is no joy without pain, no sunshine without rain. Resilience is totally undervalued. This essay makes be think about suffering in terms of disease. With the invention of CRISPR, the medical community will be able to edit germline genes. Should they?"

      "text": "One of the things we value most about this community is that we have people with politics all over the map-on unions, on immigration, on the risks and opportunities presented by Big Tech, on whether America should intervene in Ukraine, on surrogacy, on the best way to parent. And on abortion.\n\nAbortion is a topic we've covered extensively, from the ideologically motivated attacks on pro-life organizations, to the political backlash against the reversal of Roe v. Wade in Kansas, to the realities on the ground for women whose states banned abortions essentially overnight. We've devoted three episodes of Honestly to the subject and have worked to bring you the best, most thoughtful content on both sides of the issue.\n\nThis is a debate that tends to bring out the strongest passions because it touches on our most deeply held beliefs-about freedom, about choice, about the role of government, about women's rights, and about life itself.\n\nAbortion is right now in the news because on April 7, a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas suspended FDA approval for mifepristone, the abortion pill, and made it illegal to send in the mail. On April 13, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals partially blocked the Texas ruling, but with strict limitations on how mifepristone may be dispensed. The Supreme Court temporarily suspended this decision, allowing access to the drug until it reviews the arguments. The court has indicated it will hand down a decision by Friday night.\n\nIn light of that news, today we have an essay by the writer Jenny Hontz about her harrowing pregnancy experience and during the birth of her son, and how that informed her views on abortion. If you have a story about how you landed on whichever side of this debate you happen to be on, please email tips@thefp.com . We'd love to hear from you.\n\n-BW\n\nI had no problem getting pregnant at 38. The problem was staying pregnant.\n\nIn the beginning, things seemed normal. Healthy and energized, I was working and teaching yoga through my 27th week (just over six months). Then, suddenly, my abdomen started tightening at regular intervals, and I knew I was going through contractions far too early. I went to the doctor, who diagnosed me with an \" irritable uterus ,\" and prescribed bed rest and pills to prevent the contractions from progressing.\n\nI spent the next month glued to my couch. Any time my contractions started coming faster, I rushed to the hospital for a shot of terbutaline, a drug that, at the time, was widely used for slowing down the birthing process. (It now contains a boxed warning , the FDA's most serious, against this usage.)\n\nOne month into this ordeal, the meds completely stopped working, and my contractions grew more frequent and intense. Doctors admitted me to the hospital and hooked me up to an IV to give me magnesium sulfate to halt preterm labor. At first I felt relieved: a fetal heart monitor was attached to me around the clock, and if any quick action were needed, I knew I was in the right place.\n\nBut spending so much time in one small room with beeping machines, soul-sucking fluorescent lights, and only one window made me feel like the world was closing in on me.\n\nHooked up to various tubes and wires, I was unable to get up and even walk to the bathroom, and I had to lie on my left side because doctors believed other positions were riskier for the baby. My husband visited me frequently and even crawled into my hospital bed to sleep next to me one very difficult night, but because he also had a job, he could spend only brief periods by my side.\n\nDays dragged into weeks. There was no way for me to work, but it was very hard not to Google search (one-handed, on my laptop) all that could go wrong if my baby boy was born too early : sepsis, blindness, cerebral palsy, impaired learning, hearing loss, behavioral and psychological problems, an increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and more.\n\nI knew that each day I kept my son inside me, the better his prospects. But I was losing my mind. I had to beg nurses to wheel me out on a balcony to get one hour of sunlight a day. They initially refused, but I argued that even prisoners get an hour of yard time for outdoor exercise a day.\n\nEight months in, after two months on bedrest and about a month confined to a hospital bed, doctors finally told me I could go home. At this point, continuing to lie in bed presented a greater risk to my health than the risk my son faced being born a month early. But as soon as they removed the IV, my contractions kicked into high gear, clenching tighter and faster. I was moved straight to a delivery room with my husband at my side.\n\nFor the next 39 hours, I tried to push my baby out while excruciating pain stabbed me in the abdomen.\n\nWhen a nurse noticed my baby's heart rate plunging, doctors ordered an emergency C-section to save his life. My body shook uncontrollably as I was rushed into the operating room. Awake the entire time, I could see nothing with a curtain draped across my midsection, but I could hear my doctor bragging that his C-section cuts were so low I'd be able to wear a bikini without my scar showing. Vanity was the furthest thing from my mind.\n\nAnd then suddenly, I heard my baby cry. My husband cut the cord, brought our son out from around the curtain, and held him close to my head. Tears of joy-and relief-streamed down our faces. He was 6 pounds 5 ounces and 18 1/2 inches long, with a full head of dark hair that stood straight up, just like my husband. His name was Maxwell.\n\nBut within moments, nurses whisked Max away, and doctors continued to work on me. I asked if everything was okay, and that's when my surgeon said I'd had a placental abruption . I later learned this happens when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery, leading to shock, heavy bleeding in the mother, and even organ failure. Fortunately, the abruption in my case was only partial, which meant I would survive it. I was lucky. Placental abruptions account for 5 to 8 percent of maternal deaths.\n\nThank God, I wasn't one of them. Maxwell is now 13. He's getting straight As and plays soccer and just learned to solve a Rubik's Cube. But lately I find myself thinking back to Christmas Eve 2009, when I was stuck in the hospital, essentially chained to a bed, and the decade-plus of raising a child that has followed and I think: I was willing to do almost anything to save my son. But I did not want to die.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, I started to wonder: What if I had lived in a state that banned abortion and I had not wanted this baby? What if the risks to my health had been too serious to continue my pregnancy? What if I'd had other children at home who needed me, but the doctors in my state felt the law required them to put my very life at risk to save a dangerous pregnancy?\n\nThat calculus is going to become more and more common across America. On April 12, three Republican-appointed judges ruled that mifepristone, a key abortion pill used in more than half of all abortions in the U.S. and often taken at home, should not be shipped to patients' homes , despite its FDA-approved status since 2000. This has not yet gone into effect, but the same Supreme Court that struck down Roe v. Wade could decide the fate of the drug as early as Friday-and with it, the fate of millions of American women. Many of them will be forced to give birth in states where abortion is no longer legal, and chances are some will face similar trauma to mine-with far more tragic outcomes.\n\nIn Ireland, there was once a blanket ban on abortion, where the life of an unborn fetus was given the same value as the life of its mother. This led to the death, in 2012, of Savita Halappanavar , a 31-year-old Indian-born dentist. Savita was 17 weeks pregnant when a sudden infection caused her to start giving birth. Miscarriage was inevitable and there was zero chance the fetus could survive. And yet, doctors refused to abort her child while a fetal heartbeat could still be detected, and she died from septic shock. Savita's death galvanized the country and spurred Ireland to reverse its strict abortion ban .\n\nSince Roe was overturned, 13 states in the U.S.-including Missouri, Texas, and South Dakota-have full bans on abortion, including in the cases of rape or incest. In Georgia (and soon, likely Florida), abortions are legal only up until six weeks-when many women don't know they're pregnant. Abortion bans in six more states are blocked until courts decide whether to allow them.\n\nThe new abortion laws do not prevent abortion in the case of saving the mother. But already women are saying in the post- Roe world, their lives have been put at risk because doctors fear possible prosecution.\n\nIn March, five Texas women sued the state after they were denied medically necessary abortions even though none of their babies stood a chance of survival. The suit argues that the state's strict laws are scaring doctors and exposing women \"to risks of death, injury and illness, including loss of fertility.\" It is now \"less likely that every family who wants to bring children into the world will be able to do so and survive the experience,\" the suit states.\n\nTexas also allows private citizens to sue providers and anyone who helps a woman seeking an abortion after the six-week mark. Doctors can lose their license to practice, face $100,000 in fines, and even get up to 99 years in prison for offering abortion care in the state. One man, NPR reports, has already brought a claim against the women he says helped his now-ex-wife obtain abortion pills.\n\nForcing women to continue a doomed pregnancy has led to some appalling consequences. In October, 35-year-old Texas mom Lauren Miller, who was pregnant with twins, had to sneak out of state to abort one of her fetuses whose fatal anomaly endangered both her and the life of her healthy twin.\n\nLast fall in Florida, Deborah Dorbert was 24 weeks pregnant when an ultrasound found that her fetus had Potter syndrome , meaning it wasn't producing amniotic fluid. Her baby would be born without kidneys or the ability to breathe-but Dorbert, 33, was still denied an abortion. She had to carry the baby for months, and withdrew from society to avoid meeting others while carrying a very visible pregnancy that was no longer viable.\n\nA 2014 study found that 59 percent of American women who get abortions are already mothers. Furthermore, 75 percent of pregnancies after age 40 are unplanned. The maternal mortality rate for women 40 and over is 7.8 times higher than the rate for women under 25. As more women are forced to continue pregnancies with higher risks of preeclampsia, placenta previa , hypertension, and gestational diabetes, it is inevitable that more mothers will die.\n\nFor years, polls have consistently shown that two-thirds of Americans support Roe v. Wade . Post- Roe research from Pew showed that about 61 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in \"all\" or \"most\" cases. Fewer Americans support legal abortion after the start of the second trimester. But in reality, 91 percent of abortions are performed before 13 weeks, and just 1 percent occur after 21 weeks. Many of those second-trimester abortions happen because doctors find structural fetal anomalies in the fetus, which can be detected only at the 20-week ultrasound. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, almost all women who learned about a fatal fetal anomaly chose to terminate their pregnancy when it was legal.\n\nIn the last year since the reversal of Roe , one thing has become clear. When the issue is put to voters, majorities in even some of the reddest states, like Kansas and Kentucky , uphold a woman's right to choose (though currently, in the latter state, a complete ban still stands). And Republicans placing extreme limits on abortion care are increasingly finding it's a vote loser .\n\nEven so, the restrictions continue. On April 13, Republican governor Ron DeSantis of Florida signed a six-week abortion ban into law, which will take effect if the current 15-week ban is upheld in a legal challenge before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a reason I have only one child. After Max was born healthy, I told my husband that I would never, ever go through another pregnancy. Doctors agreed with that decision, telling me I had a \"sensitive uterus\" and would likely suffer the same ordeal a second time.\n\nFortunately, I never got pregnant again, but if I had, I could not imagine risking my life or enduring another endless-seeming period of hospitalization with my young son at home, unable even to visit me in the prenatal ward with high-risk mothers, per hospital rules. During my prenatal confinement, a nurse told me there was a woman down the hall who had been there since the sixteenth week of her pregnancy, with six months to go before reaching full term.\n\nI chose to endure what I went through. It was worth it because I wanted Max so badly and I love him more than anyone in the world. But I would never, ever wish this on a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. It's inhumane to force a woman or, God forbid, a girl, to go through what I did. Mothers understand what women face when we bear a child. That's why most mothers, like me, are pro-choice.\n\nThis is Jenny Hontz's first piece for The Free Press. She is a journalist and housing and education activist living in California.\n\nListen to Bari discuss the two realities of living in post-Roe America here .\n\nAnd to support more of our work, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nI believe the narcissistic view of self value over that of your own child is a tragic viewpoint. The war on life is still going strong be it at the beginning or end of life. The destruction of Judeo-Christian values be the Progressive Left (Marxist Nihilists) has succeeded and the fight to counter that continues.\n\nYou're right if the mother is crashing, then she is the one the doctor must attend to. However, it is a very unusual for an abortion to need to be performed in that situation, and if that is the case, the doctor simply gets the baby out as quickly as possible. He doesn't take the time to kill the baby first, which is what happens in an abortion.  1.3% is more than a million 24 week abortions since 1973. Non-viable fetuses do not need killing prior to delivery as they are non-viable.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Last week, the Supreme Court handed down, as they usually do as the term comes to an end, a flurry of highly anticipated major decisions. Two of them made a lot of news: one effectively ended affirmative action in American higher education, and another ruled that a Colorado web designer could refuse to create a wedding website for a same-sex couple.\n\nThe mainstream media's prevailing sentiment over the last week has been that these are the sorry consequences of a conservative majority court. This court overturned Roe v. Wade last year in a major setback to women's rights; now they've undone decades of precedent that helped historically disadvantaged students have a chance at the American dream, and they've weakened gay rights.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden was asked at a press conference last week whether or not this is a \"rogue court,\" Biden basically said yes. He muttered, \"This isn't a normal court.\"\n\nIs that true? Is this court \"not normal\"? Or do these decisions actually reflect a legitimate reading of the Constitution?\n\nTo help separate signal from noise and fact from hyperbole, today we have three legal experts from different sides of the political aisle to hash it out. Harry Litman is an attorney who has clerked for two Supreme Court justices, Thurgood Marshall and Anthony Kennedy. He is also a host of the podcast Talking Feds . Jeannie Suk Gersen is a professor at Harvard Law School and writer for The New Yorker . She clerked for David Souter. And Sarah Isgur is a columnist for The Dispatch and an ABC News contributor. She clerked for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and served as the Justice Department spokeswoman during the Trump administration.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

However if the signs said \"the Catholic Church doesn't approve of homosexuality\" or something which is just a fact, how is that compelled speech? I mean I'm imagining a wedding website and it probably says things like \"x and y are getting married\" and \"share in the loveof blahblahblah\". Is that considered compelled speech? Cause it's actually what's happening under US law, these people are being married. I understand it's not what you might want as a Catholic but I just don't see the case there for compelled speech. How is this not just a carte blanche for not taking things that go against my political opinions? Like, i don't do websites for professional women cause I don't think women should be allowed to work.\n\nGreat episode. The ONLY nit I had with it was Jeannie Suk Gersen kept casually referring to Asians as being \"overrepresented\". I get that in the context of the decision, it's a matter of fact, but as an argument, the fact that Asians are overrepresented even with affirmative action headwinds suggests that affirmative action is not broadly needed and I would have to hear Jeannie explain how Asians came to be overrepresented and how that strengthens or weakens the rationale for Affirmative Action.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Fani Willis Scandal Upends Trump Trial\n\nEditorial Team February 20, 2024\n\nWhat's happening: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and colleague Nathan Wade took questions in court last week from lawyers seeking to disqualify them from prosecuting former President Donald Trump. The high-stakes hearings involved shouting , accusations of perjury , and the judge threatening to strike Willis's testimony over frequent interruptions.\n\nCatch up: Trump's legal team alleged last month that Willis hired Wade despite his lack of experience due to their romantic relationship. Lawyers argue she improperly benefitted from expensive vacations paid for by Wade. Willis now acknowledges the relationship and other details have been revealed or corroborated.\n\nWhy it matters: These complications are already benefitting Trump's campaign by delaying his Georgia trial, which Willis wants to start before the November election, and by contributing to the popular sentiment that Trump's enemies are deeply corrupt.\n\nOn shaky ground: The crux of the prosecutors' defense is that Willis paid back Wade for their trips together. Wade admitted in court he only had one travel receipt proving this, saying that Willis paid the rest of the large expenses in cash. The prosecutors also claim their relationship began after she hired Wade, but one close witness testified otherwise.\n\nOther concerns: Willis did not disclose a plane ticket Wade paid for on financial reports, and experts say she was required to do so. She also briefly commented in court that she \"kept some of the cash\" from her first political campaign. Depending on what she meant, this may have been illegal.\n\nWhat's next: It's unclear whether the scandal could result in real consequences for Willis, though some legal analysts think the disqualification case is strong.\n\nUpward News\n\nNeed-to-know reporting and analysis you won't find in the mainstream media.\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\nAccount\n\nUpgrade\n\nAbout us\n\nAbout\n\n© 2025 Upward News.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use"

      "text": "Like millions of other Americans, for many years I have waited and prayed for the end of Roe v. Wade . Roe 's America has been, for my entire lifetime and then some, what St. Pope John Paul II called, in his 1995 encyclical Evangelium vitae , the \"culture of death.\" This has been \"actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency,\" the pontiff wrote, which in turn makes it \"possible to speak in a certain sense of a war of the powerful against the weak.\" Not just a war. A genocide. This culture of death has sent more than 63 million of my countrymen to a pre-birth grave since Roe (and Doe ) gobsmacked America in 1973, just four and a half years before I was born.\n\nMy friend and pro-life crusader Will Goodman puts it best: We are living in the time of \"the American holocaust.\" For nearly 50 years, a Supreme Court decision more barbaric than Dred Scott , more inhuman than Plessy v. Ferguson , has made our nation into a charnel house for children in the womb. More than 60 million dead in Roe 's America as of the Year of Grace 2022. And still the little bodies pile up. Still the left clamors for more killing, and yet more.\n\nYes, by all means, Roe must fall. It has been a wicked scar on our beautiful nation from the beginning. The recent news, however, has left me much more fearful than jubilant. According to leaked documents reported to be an authentic Supreme Court decision draft , a majority of Supreme Court justices plans to overturn Roe via a ruling on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case currently on the docket. The reality of this has sobered me. For a left which has already shown contempt for the Supreme Court, with calls to pack it in order to get more of what the left wants, for instance, it is clear that Roe will not die with a whimper. Roe is apparently on the gallows. And I am afraid of what happens after the trap door is sprung.\n\nBecause division and discord are all around us now. I once thought Roe would expire in an irenic scene of reconciliation. Now I see that we are much more likely to have civil war. How else to prognosticate when even the Supreme Court is attacking the Supreme Court? During oral arguments in December 2021 about Dobbs , Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered , out loud and on the record: \"Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?\"\n\nGood question. The knives are out, and it seems Roe will kick over many pillars of our system of government in its death throes. Roe has so rooted itself in the national psyche that ripping it up will dislodge 50 years of discord onto our battered republic.\n\nI was far too optimistic when, ten years ago, I stood before Planned Parenthoods and prayed for the killing to stop. I thought our holocaust could taper off and our nation could emerge from it looking ahead to a brighter future. The reality is that Roe will not heal us as it ends. It will pit us against one another like never before. The American holocaust is not an aberration; it has become part of our national character, whether we like it or not. Roe has insinuated itself into our national soul. Roe sought to add death to death, to lay waste without quarter. Roe dissolved and demoralized and disfigured as it dismembered our brothers and sisters.\n\nAn analogy might help put our situation into perspective. Imagine if the Nazis' Holocaust had not ended with the German defeat, but continued to this day. Many Germans would of course be working to stop the horrors, but even if those good Germans succeeded, what would be left when the gas chambers had been shut down? What would be the meaning of Germany after decades of cruel and wanton slaughter? What would the Germans have, both those who supported the killing and those who fought to end it, except the fallout from the killing itself? The very meaning of Germany would have been changed, from a country to a killing field. You can't flip a switch and make Auschwitz into not-Auschwitz. Some evils mark a place forever.\n\nUnlike the Nazis' Holocaust, no one from the outside has come to stop our holocaust in red, white, and blue. The meat grinder has cranked on and on. Our entertainers, our comedians, laugh at the killing. The American holocaust is a punchline for many on the left. The rest of us shake our heads and wince, but almost all of us have found some way to live our lives around the engine of death turning and turning at the heart of our nation.\n\nAnd so, now we face a similar situation today to the one I have darkly imagined above. After five decades of malicious murder, the United States is Roe now. And we will never not be, no matter how the carnage is subdued. The poison has spread through the body politic. We need to keep killing, for we cannot imagine doing otherwise. Our nation may not be able to return to a time when holocaust was not the default mode of the central state. We may have forgotten how to be human beings, after having taken, or acquiesced in the taking of, the lives of more than 63 million other human beings.\n\nWe are faced with a time beyond Roe , just as I so long prayed. But I do not think we understand that Roe , as evil as it is, is what joins us to one another now. Evil corrupts everything. It cannot be contained. It replaces good bonds with bad, replaces charity with fear. When Roe falls, and I do pray that it will, despite my fear of what comes next, the United States will disintegrate.\n\nConsider how, already, the apparent end of Roe is shaping up. In the first moments of Roe 's demise, we glimpse what awaits us in the weeks and months ahead. The leak of the Supreme Court decision draft portending Roe 's end was treachery, obviously designed to mobilize the left for the upcoming midterm elections and buy time for the culture of death to codify the American holocaust as federal law. Indeed, Senator Bernie Sanders and other Democrats responded to the leak by calling for the filibuster to be demolished so that Congress could legislate Roe 's federal guarantee of access to abortion.\n\nFrom the outset it is plain. Roe is going to take all of us down with it. The left will pull down the halls of justice so that the central injustice of Roe can yet reign.\n\nConsider that the mechanism of Dobbs , if the majority decides as the leak suggests, will probably be to remand the abortion question to the several states. Many states already have in place laws that will automatically outlaw abortion, with at most rare exceptions, the moment Roe is struck down. Others will enshrine, or already have, the right to abortion in state law. This means that we will be able to choose whether to live in a state that protects women and children, or one that targets them. And we will get to make that choice, most likely, much sooner than we might think. Roe was nationwide, so we were all stuck with one bad situation. Roe , ironically, has been a unifier of a kind, a sort of political principle, as distasteful as it is.\n\nAfter the downfall of Roe , we will not have this twisted unifier any longer. We will all be pro-choice. We will have to make a decision, obscured from us now by the blanket nature of Roe v. Wade , Doe v. Bolton , Planned Parenthood v. Casey , and other culture-of-death rulings, about how we move forward as Americans. We will be able to choose; we will have to do so. \"Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil,\" counsels the Good Book . If we are pro-lifers in a culture-of-death state, we will be drawn by our consciences and our acquaintances to the living half of the continental divide. We will become two nations. We already are and long have been, yes. But that rift will become manifest post- Dobbs , and there will be no bridging it and no turning back.\n\nThere is perhaps one way to avoid the coming national mitosis, however. We can assemble, posthaste, a truth and reconciliation commission to reckon as best we can with this American holocaust. We can have those who have done the killing, and those who have benefited from and applauded it, sit before a tribunal and unburden their souls. We can choose, as a nation, to forgive and to make amends for the 50 years of depraved violence visited on the preborn. This is a choice we can make that could prevent us all, reeling from the trauma of the American holocaust, going our separate ways.\n\nBut I wonder if such an endeavor will suffice. Truth and reconciliation commissions have done good work in Rwanda, to be sure. They have done good work in Chile, in South Africa, in Sierra Leone. But the scale of the killing in these cases is dwarfed by our homegrown slaughter. We had a communist-led truth and reconciliation commission to help us overcome the 1979 Greensboro Massacre, a rampage by the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan. But the Greensboro Massacre tallied only five victims. The American holocaust is more than 12 million times that figure. How long will our post- Roe truth and reconciliation commission go on? Will we set up a memorial to the more than 63 million victims of our half-century of federally approved, federally funded in utero lynching? Can we continue to live in a country so overshadowed by its evil past? Is there time enough, or forgiveness enough, left to our republic to work through and beyond the evil that has been done?\n\nI used to think that the demise of Roe would be morning in America. The dark night of death would be behind us, and we could learn to love one another again and move on. But now I see the end of Roe as the evening, not the dawn. A continental divide is fast approaching. When Roe falls, we will finally, I believe, have to part, the proud culture-of-death Americans on one side, and the remorseful, sorrowing, bereaved, but faintly hopeful choosers-of-life Americans on the other.\n\nJason Morgan is associate professor at Reitaku University in Kashiwa, Japan.\n\nJason Morgan is associate professor at Reitaku University in Kashiwa, Japan.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Roe v. Wade has been overruled.\n\nAfter decades of state-sanctioned slaughter, the Supreme Court Friday in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health declared that the \"Constitution does not confer a right to abortion\" and returned the question of fetal life to the states.\n\nThe decision comes weeks after a draft opinion was leaked by someone within the Court. The verdict was split along the lines foreshadowed in the leak, with Justice Samuel Alito delivering the opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh filed separate concurrences, while Chief Justice Roberts concurred only in judgment.\n\nThe Court held that \"Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided.\" It found that Roe , Casey , and other abortion precedents were unworkable, and had led to the \"distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines.\" The majority called Roe 's viability line \"arbitrary.\"\n\nIn the majority opinion, Justice Alito argued that \" Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" adding that \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\" Rather than \"bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue,\" he said, \" Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\"\n\nAlito and other members of the majority hastened to point out \"[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nJustice Thomas agreed in his concurring opinion that Dobbs itself does not cast doubt on those precedents, since the merits of the Court's 14th Amendment jurisprudence were not directly at issue in the case. However, Thomas added that, \"in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell .\" He called the Court's interpretation of the 14th Amendment to include \"substantive\" due process \"demonstrably erroneous.\"The dissenting Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan claimed that the Court's decision would have the \"certain\" result of \"the curtailment of women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\" They doubted the majority's promise that its decision would not imperil other precedents like Obergefell and Griswold , claiming that either the majority was engaged in \"hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat.\"It is uncertain whether the logic of today's decision will implicate other decisions spawned by judicial activism. What is certain, however, is the national abortion regime that has taken the lives of millions of children has met a long-overdue end.\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "The trumpets have sounded; the applause has died down. Amy Coney Barrett has been nominated by Donald Trump to the Supreme Court. Conservatives, including myself, are gearing up for a fight, one that can't be ducked and whose subtext isn't Barrett herself so much as legal abortion. Yet amid all the gut-checking and muscle-flexing, it's worth stepping back and taking a look at the decades-long quest to repeal Roe v. Wade .\n\nBecause even with a Justice Barrett, the goal is far from guaranteed.\n\nFor perspective, let's travel back to 1987. The Reagan White House was beleaguered. They'd just watched two of their Supreme Court nominations fail, first Robert Bork, who had been slandered by Ted Kennedy and then talked his way to defeat during his confirmation hearings, and then Douglas Ginsburg, withdrawn after he'd admitted to smoking marijuana (saints preserve us!). With an election year looming, the president was eager to put all the judicial jujitsu behind him. And so he tried again, this time nominating Judge Anthony Kennedy, whom he said \"seems to be popular with many senators of varying political persuasions.\"\n\nToday, Kennedy is remembered by conservatives as the biggest Supreme Court disappointment since David Souter, a defender of abortion rights, his legal thinking a cream puff of feel-good liberalism. Yet he wasn't necessarily regarded that way at the time. Kennedy was clearly cautious, lacking the flaming opinions of a Robert Bork. But that didn't stop the president of the American Conservative Union from predicting , \"When the dust settles, people will regard this as a good choice.\" There was also plenty of fire from the opposite direction. According to congressional testimony from Kate Michelman, then the executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League:\n\nMuch like Robert Bork, Kennedy aims his criticisms not at social injustice but at modern civil rights law; in his words, \"judicial power without rational restraints is simply the exercise of raw will, the arrogance of power.\" In practice, this rejection of what he calls \"judicial activism\" has amounted to an abdication of judicial responsibility to protect individual rights. Because for women reproductive freedom is an essential guarantor of all other rights and liberties, the National Abortion Rights Action League finds Anthony Kennedy a deeply disturbing candidate for the United States Supreme Court.\n\nYou would have thought Franco had absconded to Sacramento and had a baby with Joe McCarthy.\n\nAgain, it is possible to discern these things to a point. Bork was always more likely to blow up Roe than Kennedy was, as is Clarence Thomas for that matter. But the crystal ball is still foggy. The problem is that Roe- and its accompanying right-to-privacy decisions like Griswold v. Connecticut and Lawrence v. Texas -were not judicial rulings so much as legislation, the justices inflicting their own preferences on the country, leaning on a gibberish \"penumbra\" as rationale. Conservatives counter that their approach is different. They want originalists and textualists who interpret the law as it reads, not through the prism of their own whims. The liberal approach they consistently and accurately denounce as \"legislating from the bench.\"\n\nBut if your aim is to repeal legislation, then you need to think legislatively. Thus do we find conservatives assessing judges like Amy Coney Barrett based on her \"abortion record,\" which is to say her previous rulings and opinions and comments. But the circumstances of those rulings and opinions and comments differ case by case, inevitably taking into account other facets of the law: various statutes, the Constitution, stare decisis . It isn't all about abortion qua abortion. Justices may have always been political, as Hunter DeRensis writes today , but they've never been intended to be legislative. Their job is fundamentally different, their thinking both more narrow and more complex. And that's the great frustrating paradox facing pro-lifers: they must think legislatively about justices who themselves think judicially, all to throw out a piece of legislation passed by a judiciary.\n\nI sometimes think Donald Trump could stay in office for the next 35 years, replace all three liberal justices and John Roberts, and abortion would still be upheld six to three. That, of course, is probably too cynical. Again, we can discern these things to a point, and Barrett is more likely to strike down Roe than, say, the perpetually shore-hugging Roberts. Still, we should remember Barrett's own words from 2013: \"I think it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn [ Roe ]. ...The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand.\" That isn't some kind of policy statement that should be used against her; it's just a realistic appraisal of how the judiciary works.\n\nLet's fight like hell to get her on the Court. But let's acknowledge, too, the half-court shot nature of it all-and the reason why Roe is such an abomination of law in the first place.\n\nMatt Purple is a senior editor at The American Conservative .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Charles Murray says the new book by veteran science journalist Nicholas Wade is going to have an explosive impact . The book, titled A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race, And Human History , demolishes what Murray calls the \"orthodoxy\" around race and genetics: the idea that evolution has given us no meaningful genetic differences among the races. Murray writes:\n\nSince the sequencing of the human genome in 2003, what is known by geneticists has increasingly diverged from this orthodoxy, even as social scientists and the mainstream press have steadfastly ignored the new research. Nicholas Wade, for more than 20 years a highly regarded science writer at the New York Times, has written a book that pulls back the curtain.\n\nIt is hard to convey how rich this book is. It could be the textbook for a semester's college course on human evolution, systematically surveying as it does the basics of genetics, evolutionary psychology, Homo sapiens's diaspora and the recent discoveries about the evolutionary adaptations that have occurred since then. The book is a delight to read-conversational and lucid. And it will trigger an intellectual explosion the likes of which we haven't seen for a few decades.\n\nThe title gives fair warning: \"A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History.\" At the heart of the book, stated quietly but with command of the technical literature, is a bombshell. It is now known with a high level of scientific confidence that both tenets of the orthodoxy are wrong.\n\nMore:\n\nAs the story is untangled, it will also become obvious how inappropriate it is to talk in terms of the \"inferiority\" or \"superiority\" of groups. Consider, for example, the Big Five personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. What are the ideal points on these continua? They will differ depending on whether you're looking for the paragon of, say, a parent or an entrepreneur. And the Big Five only begin to tap the dozens of ways in which human traits express themselves. Individual human beings are complicated bundles of talents, proclivities, strengths and flaws that interact to produce unexpected and even internally contradictory results. The statistical tendencies (and they will be only tendencies) that differentiate groups of humans will be just as impossible to add up as the qualities of an individual. Vive les différences .\n\nMurray warns that Wade is probably about to be steamrollered by the kill-the-messenger brigades - that Wade's faith in people's ability to calmly accept and reflect on science is misplaced:\n\nBefore they have even opened \"A Troublesome Inheritance,\" some reviewers will be determined not just to refute it but to discredit it utterly-to make people embarrassed to be seen purchasing it or reading it. These chapters will be their primary target because Mr. Wade chose to expose his readers to a broad range of speculative analyses, some of which are brilliant and some of which are weak. If I had been out to trash the book, I would have focused on the weak ones, associated their flaws with the book as a whole and dismissed \"A Troublesome Inheritance\" as sloppy and inaccurate. The orthodoxy's clerisy will take that route, ransacking these chapters for material to accuse Mr. Wade of racism, pseudoscience, reliance on tainted sources, incompetence and evil intent. You can bet on it.\n\nWell, Charles Murray should know. Anyway, read the whole review . I'm not often drawn to science books, and I have a deep unease about anything to do with genetics and race, but Murray's review made me want to read this one.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "The Dobbs decision is the most significant political event in generations, but there are bigger things yet to come.\n\nThough it seems anecdotally that the inverse is more common, I found my way into the world of politics by virtue of being pro-life. It was in middle school that I first learned that the people of an alien culture coexisting beside my own still sacrificed children to demons, and did so in temples that aped healthcare clinics with priests masquerading as medical doctors. My horror was instinctive and demanded some kind of action, and I spent much of my time in the years that followed praying at clinics and marching in protests and advocating for the unborn in what little ways I could.\n\nMy entire worldview formed around this one, simple belief: Murdering babies is bad, and it ought to be illegal. Yet even in pro-life circles, and even in the last decade, that outcome seemed far from guaranteed. Everyone wanted to see Roe overturned, and most held out hope that someday it would be. But it was usually viewed as something off on the horizon-as the end goal of a struggle that may, if we were fortunate, see resolution in our lifetime.\n\nIt happened yesterday. After nearly half a century of wholesale industrial slaughter, a Supreme Court majority-comprising Samuel Alito, the three justices appointed by Donald Trump, John Roberts along for the ride, and Clarence Thomas concurring with a flamethrower-has overturned Roe v. Wade . In the opinion of the Court, Justice Alito writes that \"the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nBut this is not victory. In Dobbs , the Court did not strike down the sacrifice of children; it just struck down the mandatory sacrifice of children. As the last clause there suggests, the Court managed yesterday to affirm nothing more than the claim that \"the Nation's historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people's elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated.\" A brief overview is given of what that looked like before Roe :\n\nUntil the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy.\n\nThis summary has the double effect of reminding how little foundation Roe had in American history and law, and suggesting how much damage-beyond, of course, the 63 million human victims-the Burger Court's decision has inflicted. Virtually the entire legal and moral landscape of pre- Roe America on the question of a child's right to life has been demolished. After 50 years of brutal damage to the conscience and Constitution of a nation effectively possessed, there can be no quick or easy return to the historic American consensus that murdering babies is bad, and ought to be illegal.\n\nRoe is dead. That means the first phase of a cultural and spiritual war has been settled in our favor. But the war will go on, and new campaigns will see the conflict spill over into more than the cultural and spiritual domains.\n\nThe most devoted partisans of legal infant-sacrifice have already made it abundantly clear that they will wage violent jihad in its defense. Pregnancy centers are burning from coast to coast, Justice Brett Kavanaugh nearly met an assassin's bullet, and organized terrorists are warning of more to come. This was predictable, or at least it should have been. Only once before in our history has the country been so divided over the fundamental rights of a human person; that conflict was resolved on a battlefield.\n\nThen, too, the division was one of states against states. We learned at the cost of 600,000 American lives-just 1 percent of those already lost to the war started by Roe- that a Union cannot endure whose members cannot agree on what constitutes a human person deserving the law's protection. Yet that is exactly the situation Dobbs now sends us hurtling towards. Many states will now affirm the most basic right bestowed on all human beings by their creator. Many, such as much-discussed Virginia, will try to broker an impossible compromise between the camps of life and death. Most important of all will be those states that commit themselves fully to Moloch's cause. Notably leading the charge is Massachusetts, whose progressive Republican governor effectively declared the state a haven for abortion in post- Roe America, explicitly setting up one state of the Union in life-or-death conflict against a number of the others. This is not a path to enduring peace. It is political brinkmanship-not to mention murder by proxy.\n\nRobert P. George, a right-liberal professor of philosophy well known for his committed pro-life stance, took to Twitter yesterday to encourage magnanimity halfway to victory, instructing fellow pro-lifers: \"Please read Lincoln's Second Inaugural and be guided by its spirit. Let us not exult over those of our fellow citizens-good people who are sincerely concerned about women's welfare-who see the demise of Roe as a disaster. Malice towards none; charity for all.\"\n\nOutside the window of my office, in full view of my desk, stands a ten-foot-tall statue of David G. Farragut, the Tennessean admiral who fought for the Union in the first civil war. So my mind drifts instead toward the Battle of Mobile Bay:\n\nDamn the torpedoes.

      "text": "Of all the forms of divination condemned by the Church and rejected by our natural faculties of reason, logomancy is the most obviously absurd. Hobbes, the wittiest of English philosophers, tells us that words \"are wise men's counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the money of fools.\"\n\nThis is more or less my attitude toward listening to oral argument before the Supreme Court. Of course I would like to convince myself, on the basis of a seemingly trenchant line of questioning, a rhetorical flourish, or even a stray word from one of the justices, that the kritarchy is about to obviate Roe v. Wade . I also like to imagine, in my more whimsical moments, that one day the Nine will throw aside Griswold and discover in the inchoate intentions of our Founders a common law right to tobacco production and consumption. A man can dream.\n\nAll of which is to say that rather than sift through the entrails of today's arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , much less issue a prediction about the ultimate fate of Roe , I would like to make a few observations about the pro-life movement. There are certain facts that it seems unwilling to face.\n\nThe most significant of these is the reality of what we are up against. A world in which abortion is outlawed is not one that is very much like our own minus the (as many respectable anti-abortion activists would have it) invisible heap of baby corpses somewhere over the horizon. This is one of the many reasons I take issue with arguments like this one , which, among other things, attempts to justify anti-abortion legislation on the grounds that it would not meaningfully reduce the incidence of women in the workplace. Is that true? Can one say so reliably? Suppose it did reduce the number of women thus employed by 10 or 50 or 90 percent. Is there, for any sincere opponent of abortion, some hypothetical female unemployment threshold beyond which it would be unacceptable to find ourselves, even if it meant the proscription of child murder? If not, why make the case? The mind reels.\n\nThis sort of thing is of a piece with another argument I remember seeing years ago, when a bestselling economics textbook reached the Hitlerian conclusion that Roe had led to lower crime rates. A host of seemingly well-intentioned right-wingers rushed to argue that nothing of the kind had happened, that the data had been flubbed or even fudged. What these people did not realize was that by engaging on these terms, they had given away the game. If, carrying the argument they intended to refute to its logical conclusion, legal abortion had reduced crime rates, it follows that overturning it might lead to a corresponding increase. Suppose this were the case, or suppose, if you like, it hurt the environment, increased unemployment or the federal deficit, drove down GDP, or any other item from the social science litany. Then what?\n\nAn opponent of abortion who is not prepared to face any or all of these eventualities, up to and including the complete destruction of American society as we know it has not, I think, actually internalized the reality of abortion: mass slaughter on a scale unimaginable even by the great totalitarian regimes of the last century. On this question there is no room for nuance or soft-pedaling.\n\nWhich is why I insist on saying the quiet part out loud: The end of legalized abortion will be revolutionary. Hence (whispers the quiet voice of despair) the supreme unlikelihood that it will ever come to pass. Gibbon guessed the answer long ago-the Christian revelation was anti-social. The average decent Roman burgher was, by any reasonable measure, a moral monster, a driver of slaves, indifferent in the face of cruelties we can scarcely imagine, who after a good day's work enjoyed the slaughter of human beings in the equivalent of MetLife Stadium. All of his most basic assumptions about the good life, and all the forces and institutions that together made his reasonably comfortable and seemingly blameless existence possible, were destroyed in the Christian hecatomb of values that consumed the classical civilization Gibbon and Nietzsche admired.\n\nSo might it be in our own. I enjoy as much as any pro-lifer in this country the material benefits of living under the neoliberal democratic capitalist order that replaced the earlier post-war bourgeois civilization. But I also recognize such gains for what they are: ill-gotten, embarrassing, a plate of what the Chinese call 豬血粿, \"pig's blood cakes.\" It is impossible to say what might replace the world that legalized abortion made, but it is absurd to dismiss out of hand the possibility that it will be a less comfortable, less enlightened, and I daresay less convenient one-an unfamiliar world from which many things that are true, beautiful, and of good report disappear, perhaps forever.\n\nHow many avowed opponents of abortion are willing to face this? How many would in fact trade the eradication of our way of life for the end of legalized infanticide? Not, one imagines, quite as many as are willing to identify themselves blithely with our cause on the assumption that it is a less radical one than they have been taught to believe.\n\nFrom this conclusion, I think, it logically follows that we should not be optimistic about the chances for an end to abortion. Instead we must have hope , that more exalted virtue whose ultimate object is endless rest in God the Lord .\n\nMatthew Walther is editor of the Lamp magazine and a contributing editor of The American Conservative.\n\nMatthew Walther is editor of The Lamp and a contributing editor of The American Conservative.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.\n\nIn the early days of spring a wild red fox made her home on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. She started attacking passersby (including at least one journalist and one member of Congress) and turned out to be rabid. She died at the federales ' hands on April 5, along with all her children.\n\nOn Monday, May 2, another fox chewed through a fence and found his way onto the grounds of the Smithsonian National Zoo. He killed a northern pintail duck and 25 flamingoes, injuring three more in the bloodiest scene of senseless violence the public attraction has experienced in decades.\n\nThe next day, May 3, I'm standing outside the Supreme Court when a strange-looking older man catches my attention. He's more than a little over six feet tall, totally bald, broad nose and prominent brow. Something unsettling behind his eyes. White alligator-skin cowboy boots and an ill-fitting Roman collar under a black t-shirt that reads , in part: \"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Morals are Worse Than Animals. Proof: The National Zoo.\" He styles himself Reverend Leroy Swailes, though I'd like to know who actually ordained him.\n\nHe's not the only one here with religious motivations. Jamie Manson, M.Div., president of Catholics for Choice, is among the featured speakers as demonstrators gather to protest Justice Samuel Alito's leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health , which would overturn Roe v. Wade and its federal mandate of legalized child murder.\n\nShe \"call[s] on President Biden, who is a pro-choice Catholic\"-here the crowd cheers wildly-to \"leave no stone underturned\" in the attempt to prevent any restriction of abortion. This includes, for some reason, \"publishing the Equal Rights Amendment so we can be in the Constitution.\"\n\nManson has made a career out of publicly flouting the authority of the Church, especially when it comes into conflict with American left-liberalism. Last year, she did a Jack-Chick-in-drag act in the New York Times , ranting about \"insidious papal teachings\" on gender, sex, and life. Yet today she presents herself as some kind of authority on true Catholic morality. She cites some specious polling and celebrates the abominable tragedy that even Catholic women kill their children in abortions, as if to suggest that the ubiquity of sin is some kind of imprimatur.\n\nOthers are more honest about how far they've strayed. One woman (I don't catch her name) explains that she grew up Catholic, \"and then I learned that if women don't have this fundamental right to abortion, they are nothing more than slaves to their reproduction.\" Just like in other post-Christian countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela where abortion restrictions have been overturned, she sees the best way to preserve the infanticide license as enthusiasts demonstrating \"in the streets with a wave of green,\" with the express purpose of disrupting social order unless the Satanic demand is met. People have taken the message to heart: D.C. churches are already preparing for intruders at Mass this Sunday.\n\nThe night before-as the fox tore through the flamingo house-the spiritual war took on a different valence in front of the Supreme Court building. Young men from Catholic University prayed the rosary as pro-abortion demonstrators mobbed around them shouting vile obscenities. I intervened when an older guy placed his hands on one of them. He was tall but oddly built, an S-shaped figure comprising a beergut and a concave chest, craning neck topped by a balding head, face (of course) covered by a mask. He wore a lavender t-shirt that said \"Hug Life\" and seemed to depict two naked cartoon figures in a weird side-by-side embrace. In graphic detail he explained how he wished my \"mother had strangled the life out of [me] the second [I was] born.\" He mumbled some things about rape and murder. His honesty-the unflinching, unabashed evil with which he professed what he was there for-was jarring, but revelatory.\n\nThe exchange broke off when a fight broke out a little to my right. A pro-life man (I talked to him a little afterwards) in professional clothes had been standing on the edge of the crowd when another of the agitators-a scrawny kid with long hair, blacked-out clothes and a black bike helmet and his face hidden behind both a mask and a bandana-came out of nowhere and sucker-punched him. The pro-life guy took one hit back in self-defense; antifa bro crumpled to the ground, then got up and scurried off into the crowd. Here, even the violence is pathetic.\n\nIn daylight everything seems sadder still. The air of drama and immediacy that barely hovered over the proceedings Monday night has entirely disappeared by Tuesday morning. As Manson and others who see an opportunity here-Amy Klobuchar still thinks she might be president-rotate on the microphone, the usual cast of white-collar blue-city protestors filter through.\n\n\"We all know this court decision is some f-ked up racist nonsense, so I'm not going to talk about it,\" somebody starts over the sound system.\n\nOne dude's sign is a flattened-out U-Haul moving box with wire hangers glued to it. In red and black marker he's written out: \" Marbury v. Madison ≠ settled precedent. Judicial review is not in the Constitution either.\"  I doubt he came to that opinion reading The Warren Revolution . \"Reproductive Health=Trans Health\" seems not just counterintuitive but a little bit impossible. \"Keep your rosaries off my ovaries\" misses on a number of points. \"You f-king f-ks\" is vague but versatile, I guess.\n\nThe chants, like the man from the night before, are astonishingly shameless. \"Abortion on demand and without apology\" is a simple staple. \"Free abortion on demand.\" \"Our children need abortion rights.\"\n\nBrad Sherman, a California congressman, takes the stand. An egg-shaped woman in a bright, translucent yellow jumpsuit demands to know through a megaphone of her own: \"Why are men talking? Why - are - men - talking?\"\n\nThe girl in front of me with two late-middle-aged women must be 7 or 8 years old. They've given her a cardboard sign with \"My body, my choice\" in the clear handwriting of a grown adult.\n\nA little to the right of us a small group of pro-life protestors is counter-demonstrating. They have a huge poster showing the body of a murdered child fairly early in gestation: dark eyes sitting in a bulbous head, little arms taking form down by her side. One of the pro-abortion women ventures over to take a look. She almost falls down, and lets rip a screeching hihihihi cackle that is not just insincere but, in some way, inhuman. \"They're trying to say that's a baby,\" she shouts back to her friends in disbelief. \"It's, like, cells.\"\n\nThe chants continue behind it all, responses all quick and well rehearsed. From the microphone an activist calls out: \"This is what democracy looks like.\" The ragtag gaggle echoes back the words: \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nOn this, if nothing else, I fear they may be right.\n\nDeclan Leary was a senior editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "The Supreme Court announced earlier this week that it will review a major abortion case, and the left has already begun to shiver. The ACLU, which can no longer be bothered to defend freedom of speech, warned that a fundamental American right is at stake. Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent the better part of four years trying to impeach an elected president, declared that Roe v. Wade is \"settled.\"\n\nThere is no legal regime on earth, no statute or clause, that is so supreme in the progressive imagination as Roe . The First Amendment is to be curtailed by Twitter mobs shouting \"racism!\" in a crowded theater, the Second Amendment is a dusty artifact from the age of flintlocks and powdered wigs, but a 1973 court ruling is absolutely unassailable. Roe is constitutional law; Roe is common law; Roe was engraved on tablets of stone and handed down by God to Jessica Valenti atop Mount Choice.\n\nStill, progressives are right about this much: this very well could be the end of Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe case in question, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , is being litigated over a statute in Mississippi that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This is clearly not allowed under the half-assed scheme devised by the Court in Roe , which requires that abortions be legal until fetal viability, the point when the fetus can ostensibly survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks in. Such a line has always been arbitrary both because of its inherent judicial God-playing and because viability necessarily shifts earlier as medical technology advances. Mississippi, in crossing that line, was always aiming to land before the Supreme Court. And after their law was struck down by a district court and then by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, they made it.\n\nThe last time the Supreme Court took a hard look at abortion was last summer when it blocked a pro-life law in Louisiana that would have required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. That was a 5-4 decision with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the five. Roberts had previously voted with the minority to uphold an almost identical Texas statute, but that was before Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the Court and gave the so-called conservatives a majority. Faced with the prospect of actually influencing abortion law, Roberts headed for the hills. He cited the precedent of the Texas case-which he opposed-as a reason not to intervene in the Louisiana one.\n\nRoberts was once regarded as a conservative legal golden boy, so much so that George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice before he was even on the Court. Today, he's seen as too addled by political concerns and stare decisis to do what's right. Yet the Court has also changed since he last sold out. Amy Coney Barrett now sits enthroned in all her splendor. That means conservatives can get to five votes without Roberts. Gorsuch, who takes a less restrained approach to precedent than the light-fingered chief justice, has even been low-key quarreling with Roberts in his opinions, a sign of the former tiebreaker's diminished power.\n\nThere is something to like in Roberts' incrementalist view of the bench, even if it occasionally leads to the wrong outcomes. But the fact remains that the only way to roll back compulsory legal abortion will be through an act of Court audacity. And the dirty little secret of conservative judicial politics is this: it's always been about Roe . No volunteer canvasser has ever showed up at a Republican presidential campaign HQ, rubbing his hands together, gushing, \"Think of it! One more justice and we can finally get rid of the Chevron Doctrine!\" That's not how this works. For the door knockers and the envelope lickers, judicial confirmations are code for abortion. And given that pro-choice activists once tried to smear Anthony Kennedy as being too pro-life to sit on the Court, it seems fair to surmise that the left thinks the same way.\n\nThe judicial jostling has always been a culture war, and now it may have finally paid off. Picture that \"But Gorsuch\" meme only the sign is about 200 feet above the water. The Mississippi case is the big one, and it may also be the last one. If the Court doesn't do the deed now-if one of the conservative justices wobbles and saves Roe -then it's difficult to imagine that it willl ever get done. I suppose Justice Stephen Breyer, 82, could end up leaving or passing away under a Republican president (progressives are already screaming for him to retire), which would allow for the appointment of yet another conservative justice. But lightning struck thrice under Donald Trump ( well, twice ); it seems unlikely to strike again. And let's not forget that Clarence Thomas, though 10 years younger than Breyer, is also getting up there in years.\n\nThis strategy eventually runs out of time, not just because the justices age but because Roe does as well. Pro-lifers are well aware of the admonition that if you don't overturn a court decision within 20 years, you never will. And Roe long ago passed that milestone. This dovetails into another set of stakes in the Mississippi case, which have to do with internecine conservative politics. There are some on the right who have despaired of this achingly slow strategy, measured not just in years but in human lives. They've grown suspicious of the Federalist Society, or FedSoc, the legal group that grooms conservative court nominees. They worry FedSoc is too establishment and not focused enough on social issues like abortion.\n\nThis has resulted in challenges to FedSoc's regnant judicial philosophy of originalism, most notably from the legal scholar Josh Hammer who is working on an alternative called \"common good originalism.\" What hasn't been proposed is a practical strategy to overturn Roe that doesn't involve waiting on the current Court. The skeptics thus haven't parted ways with the right-of-center legal movement-not yet-but a misfire in the Mississippi case could cause them to reevaluate. They're already annoyed over what they view as Gorsuch's betrayal in Bostock v. Clayton County , which saw him peer into the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and magically discover that its anti-discrimination protections on the basis of \"sex\" also covered gay people and the transgendered. All this from a textualist, an originalist-hence the skepticism.\n\nYet ironically, it's that same assertiveness in Bostock that makes Gorsuch more likely than Roberts to throw out Roe... even though Roberts agreed with Gorsuch in Bostock... yet didn't agree with him on last year's abortion case. It's like herding cats, this. Jurists are not party-line legislators, and treating them as such long ago grew frustrating. Will it pay off? The Court says that in taking the Mississippi case it intends to answer the question of \"whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortion are unconstitutional.\" It's possible they could simply agree with Mississippi and move the viability line established in Roe back to 15 weeks in accordance with that state's law.\n\nYet remember how brittle that line is. Over at First Things , the law professor Gerard Bradley argues that \"the main arguments offered by Mississippi against 'viability'...work as well against a fifteen-week 'viability' line as they do against one set at twenty-two weeks.\" And from there, Bradley adds, \"The court will struggle, and perhaps mightily, to write an opinion that discards 'viability' without overturning Roe .\"\n\nRoberts might be willing to thread one of those needles. But the other five? If Bradley is right, then it's all or nothing. This is the big one and the stakes are eye-wateringly high.\n\nMatt Purple is a senior editor at The American Conservative .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

Most recently, he liked a clip of an anti-Semitic rant by Nick Fuentes.\n\n\"Let's just be open and honest about the stats: 17 of the top 25 hedge funds are run by Jews; 17 of the top 27 donors in the 2020 presidential election were Jews; seven out of eight Ivy League universities have Jewish presidents; three out of three of the major recording companies and major record labels - run by Jews,\" Fuentes said in his rant.\n\n\"As soon as I saw that clip and saw Stephen A. Smith liked it,\" Whitlock begins, \"I was like, oh, look at Stephen A. Smith. This is a game. He's putting himself in the political news cycle. This is intentional. This is just Stephen A. Smith continuing to try to put himself in the political news cycle.\"\n\nAnd it's working, as after he liked the post, Smith posted on X that he had no idea who Nick Fuentes was.\n\n\"I do not know who this is or what that video is. If it was 'liked,' it was unintentional,\" Smith wrote in his post.\n\n\"This is an intentional mistake,\" Whitlock says, noting that Smith isn't the only one jumping into the political news cycle.\n\n\"Jasmine Crockett,\" Whitlock says. \"Someone asked her a question about Elon Musk , and she had one of the most unprofessional and just undignified responses you could possibly have.\"\n\nWhen Rep.

      "text": "Cellphone data suggests Fani Willis, Nathan Wade may have become romantic much earlier than they claimed under oath\n\nA new report from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution indicates that the romantic relationship between Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and fellow prosecutor Nathan Wade may have begun much earlier than the two claimed in sworn testimony last week, bolstering claims by former President Donald Trump and other defendants that the election interference case against them is irreparably compromised.\n\nWillis hired Wade in November 2021 to help her prosecute the Trump RICO case involving nearly 20 total defendants. Co-defendant Michael Roman and his legal team presented evidence last month that Willis and Wade had been more than just business associates while preparing the case and that they even had taken lavish pleasure trips together on the taxpayers' dime, creating a conflict of interest.\n\nWillis filed a motion on February 2 denying that her \"private\" former relationship with Wade gave her any \"direct or indirect financial benefit\" and therefore that she had \"no personal conflict of interest that justifies her disqualification,\" as Blaze News previously reported.\n\nThen at a hearing to consider the matter last week, Willis and Wade both took the stand to defend their behavior. Both Willis and Wade claimed that they developed a romantic relationship in spring 2022, several months after they had begun working together on the case, and that the relationship ended last summer.\n\nDuring his testimony, Wade claimed that while he did visit Willis at her condo in the Hapeville neighborhood in a non-romantic capacity in 2021, he went there no more than 10 times and never stayed the night .\n\n\"So if phone records were to reflect that you were making phone calls from the same location as the condo before Nov. 1, 2021,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow asked, \"and it was on multiple occasions, the phone records would be wrong?\"\n\n\"If phone records reflected that, yes, sir,\" Wade replied.\n\n\"They'd be wrong?\" Sadow asked again.\n\n\"They'd be wrong,\" Wade repeated.\n\nHowever, a new affidavit submitted by Trump's legal team on Friday suggests otherwise. According to the affidavit, which Geraldo Rivera described as \"an earthquake,\" between January and November 2021, Wade had visited Willis' Hapeville home at least 35 times and had twice come over late at night and left in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThe allegations are based on data collected from Wade's cellphone. The data indicated that on each of these 35 occasions, Wade remained at Willis' residence for \"an extended period of time,\" almost always in the evening. For example, data reportedly showed that Wade arrived in the area of Willis' address at 10:45 p.m. on September 11, 2021, and left the area at 3:28 a.m. the following morning. He then returned to the area of his residence in East Cobb at 4:05 a.m.\n\nIn all, the data collected from Wade's cellphone reportedly demonstrates that he and Willis exchanged over 2,000 phone calls and nearly 10,000 text messages in 2021 before Willis hired Wade for the Trump election case, the Journal-Constitution reported.\n\n\"The focus of this case will continue to shift rapidly away from Trump and his co-defendants and hit squarely on the credibility and possible perjury of the prosecutor,\" Rivera opined on social media.\n\n\"This is exactly why you don't want your emotionally distraught client to take the witness stand under oath to defend their character.\"\n\nHowever, some still say that the cellphone data is not definitive proof of misconduct. Georgia Tech electrical and computer engineering professor Paul Steffes - who \"reviewed a summary of the investigation included in the affidavit,\" the AJC reported - claimed that the data indicates only that Wade was within an area, about nine square miles in size, that includes Willis' condo.\n\nFormer DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James was likewise skeptical that the data contradicted the former couple's respective testimonies. \"The real question is whether there was proof there was a romantic relationship at that time,\" James said, \"and I don't think this proves there was. It just proves a relationship, which they've already acknowledged.\"\n\nJudge Scott McAfee, who will determine whether to disqualify Willis and her office from the RICO case, has yet to decide whether to accept the affidavit into evidence.\n\nJeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Willis, issued the following statement on Friday: \"We are required to respond to the filing via the court and we are preparing a response now.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Nia had phoned their mother following the arrest.\n\nThe DailyMail.com reported that Kinaya cooperated throughout her arrest and did not attempt to use her mother's position to avoid the charge.\n\nAfter Kinaya was already placed in a police cruiser and en route to Fayette County Jail, Willis showed up at the scene of the arrest with her alleged former partner, Wade.\n\nAt one point, officers referred to Willis and Wade as Kinaya's parents, to which Willis corrected them, calling him \"just a friend.\"\n\n\"Why was she stopped?\" Wade asked the officers at the scene.\n\nWillis stated it was \"news to me\" when authorities notified her that Kinaya's license had been revoked.\n\nDuring her exchange with officers, she provided her address by stating, \"Obviously don't put my address down ... y'all can have my address, the rest of the world, no.\"\n\nOne officer responded, \"For obvious reasons,\" suggesting he was aware of Willis' position as DA.\n\nKinaya was later released from jail and ordered to attend the Town of Tyrone Municipal Court for an October arraignment.\n\nLast year, Willis charged former President Donald Trump with 41 criminal counts for allegedly violating Georgia's anti-racketeering law by attempting to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in the state - one of four indictments lodged against Trump.\n\nWillis hired Wade to lead the case, but he later stepped down after their romantic tryst was exposed.\n\nIn a January court filing, Willis was accused of having an \"improper, clandestine relationship\" with Wade. She admitted to the affair but claimed that it started after he was hired and ended in 2023.\n\nThe case against Trump has been pushed back due to Willis' inappropriate workplace romance, but she remains on the case.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Now 15 years old, Zion is legally Zaya Malachi Airamis Wade after a judge granted the legal name and gender change. The judge confirmed the teen's transgender transition and allowed sex markers on documents to match the 15-year-old's preferred gender identity. The ruling was made in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday.\n\nThe court filing from November stated, \"A court order affirming her identity will allow Zaya to live more comfortably and honestly in all aspects of her life - from simple introductions and food orders, to applying for a driver's license and filling out college applications.\"\n\nThe court document said, \"This Petition is about empowering Zaya to live her truth.\"\n\nHowever, the teen's mother has objected to her child's transgender transition throughout the legal process.

      "text": "Squires: The NAACP wants black men to follow Dwyane Wade up 'Broke Buck Mountain'\n\nThe trailer for a new political drama debuted last Saturday at the 54th NAACP Image Awards. The civil rights organization didn't give it a title, but as someone who understands the priorities of the modern left, I know exactly what it should be called: \"Broke Buck Mountain.\"\n\nThe \"black buck\" was an ugly racial stereotype used to describe defiant, physically imposing black men who defied white authorities. He was seen as quick-tempered, violent, and unintelligent. An internet search of the term \"buck breaking\" will return blog posts and YouTube videos describing slave owners whipping and raping male slaves to weaken their rebellious nature.\n\nMuch like the \"Willie Lynch\" letter on controlling slaves, it is hard to detach the twisted logic of \"buck breaking\" from the historical prevalence of the practice. That said, the entire purpose of buck breaking is to make everyone watching the humiliation obey the master's plan. Breaking the will of the biggest, strongest, most influential man makes it easier to control the masses.\n\nThis is why the film \"Brokeback Mountain\" was such a cultural flash point. The plot revolves around the relationship between two cowboys who meet as young men in Wyoming and have a complex sexual relationship that spans two decades. The film wouldn't have had nearly the impact if Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal had instead played two hairdressers who battled homophobia and AIDS in the 1980s. Their traditionally masculine work was a major part of the plot.\n\n\"Broke Buck Mountain\" is the hill Dwyane Wade has been climbing as a LGBTQIA+ ally for the past few years. The NBA legend has talked openly about the journey he's been on to help his son Zaya - born Zion - achieve his dreams. Wade has been described as the type of father every LGBTQIA+ child needs. Zaya was granted a legal name and gender change by a Los Angeles County judge one day before the NAACP Image Awards aired.\n\nThis is the reason Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union-Wade received the NAACP President's Award Saturday night in front of a room full of black entertainers, journalists, and activists. The couple gave a five-minute acceptance speech . Wade talked about his desire to support Zaya in his \"transition,\" and his wife spoke passionately about the threats black trans people face in America.\n\nIt was the perfect speech for an event dedicated to showing the world exactly what kind of image the NAACP is promoting.\n\nThe organization knows that men like Dwyane Wade, a retired NBA champion and surefire Hall of Famer, play a critical role in the left's identity politics transition. Wade's appearance on \"Ellen\" reached a mainstream audience, but his discussion with fellow professional athletes on \"I Am Athlete\" about how Zaya \"educated\" him on trans issues is what will change the hearts and minds of men who want to be less \"toxic\" LGBTQIA+ allies.\n\nThis is exactly what the NAACP is hoping, largely because it sees the LGBT community as a growth market. The black population has hovered at 13% for half a century - partly due to black leaders who vocally support abortion - but 20% of young people in Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2004) identify as LGBT.\n\nThe NAACP understands that \" rainbow \" is the new black. Shifting the organization's focus to issues concerning sex, sexuality, and gender identity allows the group to turn a triple play: align with current Democratic Party priorities, continue to reach and promote the party's black female base, and paint itself as a champion for the oppressed and marginalized, no different from when it was winning desegregation cases in the 1950s.\n\nBut this is a very different NAACP from the one that had the support of many black Christians in the 1960s. The NAACP of Brown vs. Board of Education is dead. The organization that fought for human dignity by standing against the color line is now undermining the imago Dei by working to destroy the sex binary.\n\nIn fact, it is not even the same organization that the Baltimore Sun described as a \"secular organization with a heavy religious overlay\" in a 1996 story about its national convention and new president Kweisi Mfume. One section captured the religious nature of the event this way:\n\nToday's NAACP nominated Lil Nas X for Entertainer of the Year at the Image Awards in 2022. It is unlikely someone like Tony Dungy, a Christian with biblical views of sexuality and the human body, would be honored by the NAACP or any progressive \"pro-black\" institution.\n\nInstead, the NAACP and its peer organizations in the civil rights industry are leading the charge to bring \"backward\" black people - especially men - into the light regarding LGBT issues.\n\nEvery country, culture, and community has to decide what type of beliefs and behaviors it promotes publicly and which ones must be practiced privately. This is a critically important distinction, because punishment (e.g., social, criminal, economic) awaits those who move certain practices from the living room to Main Street without social approval. Every society has a \"closet\"; the only question is what - or who - has to go inside. In the NAACP's mind, men who think they are women should be free to tell our children that they too can change their sex, while people who believe in Genesis - or genetics - are forced to keep their \"hateful\" views to themselves.\n\nI have compassion for Zaya Wade and every other person - young and old - who feels their bodies are at war with their minds. Their distress shouldn't be ignored, but that doesn't mean we should lie to them about reality. No amount of surgery, medication, or linguistic gymnastics can change who they are.\n\nInstead of treating his mental health issues as a private matter, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union are using their son to completely transform society, all with the full support of one of the oldest civil rights organizations in the nation.\n\nThe NAACP's Image Awards were a clear signal of how the organization sees - and plans to lead - the black community in the coming years. The NAACP wants straight black men to follow Dwyane Wade up the mountain to complete the \"transition\" from LGBT antagonists to allies. Anyone who refuses should expect to be compared to Bull Connor or George Wallace.\n\nIt is no surprise that Michael Strahan, NFL Hall of Famer turned television personality, introduced the world to a \"drag kid\" on \"Good Morning America\" in 2018. Likewise, former NFL wide receiver Nate Burleson was the \" CBS Mornings \" co-host who introduced the Wades winning the NAACP Image Award as well as the trans activist who came on to \"educate\" viewers.\n\nThe people looking to subvert the natural order and pervert the minds of our children are betting millions of black men will follow black athletes who have been compromised and humiliated.\n\nThe pressure is on, but we cannot allow ourselves to be broken.\n\nDelano Squires\n\nContributor"

      "text": "Nathan Wade, former lover of Fani Willis, resurfaces after apparently dodging House subpoena\n\nTrump surrogates have served prison time for ignoring subpoenas from Jan. 6 committee.\n\nNathan Wade, the Atlanta-area attorney who once attempted to prosecute former President Donald Trump, may now be in some hot water himself after he apparently avoided the service of a congressional subpoena.\n\nLast Friday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued a subpoena for Wade to participate in a closed-door interview regarding the Fulton County case against Trump spearheaded by Wade's former lover, District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nJordan issued the subpoena because he and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are looking into what Jordan characterized as the 'politically motivated prosecution' of Trump.\n\nThough the subpoena demanded that Wade appear before the committee on Thursday, Wade never responded and then went missing, allegedly because he was \"trying to avoid service,\" a Republican lawyer familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner .\n\nSo Jordan ordered the U.S. Marshals to go find him.\n\n\"Nathan Wade's evasion of service is extremely unusual and will require the Committee to spend US tax dollars to locate him,\" Russell Dye , a spokesman for the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nWade had not responded to any of the emails associated with the subpoena, and his attorney had declined accepting service, the New York Post reported.\n\nSeveral days ago, Roy Barnes, an attorney representing Willis, insisted the committee that Wade's interview would have to be postponed so that a lawyer from Willis' office could accompany him and \"assert any necessary privilege objections.\" Jordan denied that request.\n\n\"The eleventh-hour intervention from District Attorney Willis does not excuse your failure to appear for your transcribed interview,\" Jordan informed Wade.\n\nThe pressure campaign appears to have worked as late Thursday evening, Wade contacted the U.S. Marshals and scheduled an appointment for subpoena service. The Post indicated that he has since been served.\n\nWade's appearance before the committee will be rescheduled on account of the delay, the Post said.\n\nJordan issued the subpoena because he and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are looking into what Jordan characterized as Willis' \"politically motivated prosecution\" of Trump.\n\nTrump and 18 other defendants have been accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. Though pundits insisted the evidence in that case spelled trouble for Trump, the future of the case now remains largely in doubt for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, the former president has challenged the merits of the charges in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling regarding presidential immunity . Three charges against Trump have already been dropped as a result.\n\nFurthermore, Wade found himself accused of financially benefitting from the prosecution of Trump after his extramarital affair with Willis came to light earlier this year. Before he was removed from the case because of the apparent conflict of interest, Wade collected $700,000 for his work on the Trump-racketeering case, even though he has no experience prosecuting such cases.\n\nBoth Wade and Willis testified under oath that their sexual relationship began after Willis hired Wade, though cell phone data and testimony from former associates cast doubt on those assertions.\n\nTheir affair supposedly ended in the summer of 2023. However, the pair apparently remains in close contact since Wade joined Willis when she arrived on the scene of her daughter's arrest for allegedly driving on a suspended license a few weeks ago.\n\nWade and his wife reached a temporary agreement in their divorce case earlier this year.\n\nIn February, Willis received a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee regarding her office's expenditures on the Trump case. Willis denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Any examination of the records of our grant programs will find that they are highly effective and conducted in cooperation with the Department of Justice and in compliance with all Department of Justice requirements,\" she said in a statement.\n\nWade's law office did not respond to a previous request for comment from the Examiner.\n\nFormer Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro were each sentenced to four months in prison for failing to comply with a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena.\n\nNavarro completed his sentence earlier this year. Bannon remains in custody at this time and will be released just days before the 2024 election.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Florida Suspends Abortion Clinic After Hospitalizations\n\nShare This article\n\nPENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) - An abortion clinic that serves women from all over the U.S. South had its license suspended this weekend under an emergency order from Florida health officials after two women who had undergone procedures at the clinic were hospitalized this year.\n\nThe state Agency for Health Care Administration ordered the suspension of the license for American Family Planning of Pensacola, effective starting Saturday.\n\nIn cases cited by the agency, the clinic failed to monitor the patients at all times, didn't provide medical records when patients were transferred for greater care and didn't contact the patients within 24 hours after they left the clinic to assess their recovery, said the order which was issued on Friday.\n\nIt said the problems were operational deficiencies \"endangering the health, safety and welfare\" of the clinic's patients, and the clinic failed to submit timely reports about the incidents to the state agency.\n\nIn one case, clinic workers urged the husband of a patient to take her to a hospital in Mobile, Alabama, rather than a closer hospital in Pensacola that had a transfer agreement with the clinic, delaying her treatment. At the Alabama hospital, the woman needed to be resuscitated and required a transfusion to replace blood loss, according to the emergency order.\n\nIn another case from March, a patient was taken to the emergency room of a Pensacola hospital with bleeding and low blood pressure. She needed emergency surgery and a surgeon performed a hysterectomy. Last year, a third patient required a uterine perforation repair, according to the emergency order.\n\n\"Women receiving abortions must receive the level of care and services mandated by law,\" the emergency order said.\n\nThe clinic is entitled to a hearing about the decision.\n\nA woman who says she works for the clinic's scheduling service answered the phone on Sunday but said nobody was there who could talk about the emergency order.\n\nBecause of its historically less restrictive laws, Florida has long been considered a \"safe haven\" for women from neighboring states wanting to get abortions. On its website, the clinic says it serves women from Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia.\n\nEven though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last month legislation that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks, Florida's abortion law is still likely to be less restrictive than those of neighboring states should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCopyright 2022. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nShare This article\n\nYou are signing up to receive general newsletters from CBN.

      "text": "Brett Kavanaugh Confirmation Hearings Kick Off with Fireworks\n\nShare This article\n\nWASHINGTON - Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is taking center stage on Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee began the confirmation process with opening statements this morning, which will be followed by two days of questioning.\n\nDemocrats don't want Kavanaugh on the high court so they immediately tried to shut down the hearings, demanding more documents about Kavanaugh's previous government service. As one Democrat after another persistently tried to block the proceedings, quarreling and confusion ensued, and Republicans accused them of turning the hearing into a circus.\n\nNumerous hecklers contributed to the raucous scene, shouting repeatedly throughout the first few hours of opening statements.\n\nMany Democrats had refused to meet with Kavanaugh in the lead up to the hearings and had already tried numerous tactics to delay the hearing. But Republicans put the brakes on any effort to push the hearings until after the midterm elections.\n\n\"Let there be no misunderstanding that there would be any kind of delaying tactic that would take us past the first Tuesday in November,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters in July.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nominee has already been a vicious confirmation battle. Specifically, his stance on Roe v. Wade has been a center point of contention. Liberals believe Kavanaugh will try to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling which created a right to abortion. But several key senators have indicated they're satisfied with Kavanaugh when it comes to the abortion issue.\n\n\"He said that he agreed with what Justice (John) Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said that it was settled law,\" said pro-choice Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who met with Kavanaugh last month.\n\nMany Democrats, however, want more than that. Just last month, Democratic lawmakers demanded almost a million pages of documents on the judge from the National Archives. And during this week's confirmation hearings, they plan to use their time to pick apart his stance on abortion and other issues.\n\n\"How much more do they need to know to vote no? And yet they're really pushing hard for everything,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said.\n\nKavanaugh enters the ring with respected credentials: He earned a Yale law degree, clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy and has a vast judicial record with more than 300 opinions.\n\nHis confirmation could influence the court for decades.\n\n\"I think Judge Kavanaugh is satisfying people that he's going to be an independent person, that he's going to leave his personal views out of it - that he's going to look at the law and look at the facts of the case,\" Grassley said.\n\nRepublicans hope to get Kavanaugh seated on the bench by Oct. 1, the start of the next Supreme Court session.\n\nThe GOP has a razor-thin majority in the Senate and will need every vote to push this nominee through.\n\nShare This article\n\nBen Kennedy is an Emmy Award-winning White House correspondent for CBN News in Washington, D.C.

He was ultimately operated on and a cancerous tumor was removed.\n\nAnd while the former Miami Heat star has now declared himself cancer-free, he got emotional while on TODAY with Jenna & Friends .\n\n'No one has ever really experienced me being weak,' Wade said Tuesday on the show, via People . 'I've always been the strong one, the most confident one, the world champion that has lifted the trophies over his head. That's the image, but this was a moment where I knew I was going to be uncertain and a little weak.'\n\nWade, whose father and grandfather have both been diagnosed with prostate cancer , said he felt a 'pain that I had never felt before' after emerging from surgery.\n\nHe also opened up about the unnerving process of meeting with doctors before he knew he had cancer.\n\nDwyane Wade got emotional after speaking about his previous cancer diagnosis on TODAY with Jenna & Friends\n\nWade, seen with his wife Gabrielle Union, had a portion of his kidney removed after doctors found a cancerous tumor\n\nWade is a three-time NBA champion and Olympic gold medalist after a glittering NBA career\n\n'I got a call from my doctor and in the midst of that call, you could just hear her uncertainty,' he said. 'They thought they saw something on my kidney. They were like, 'Well, we don't know if it's cancerous, but there's something on there.''\n\nWade said a different doctor's visit also left him 'scared' when he told the basketball star he didn't want what was on his kidney  - which was not yet determined to be cancer - to spread.\n\nIt was later determined after the surgery that he had had Stage 1 cancer.\n\nWade, who has been married to his wife Gabrielle Union for 11 years, added that he was 'most afraid of being that vulnerable' in front of her.\n\n'It sounds crazy because those [his wife and their children] are supposed to be the ones you want to be there in those moments of weakness, but you don't want them to see you in that space.'\n\nWade shares son Xavier, 11, with his ex, Basketball Wives alum Aja Metoyer. He was on a break with Union when the relationship with Aja began and their child was born in 2013.\n\nHe ultimately got back together with Union and they married in 2014.

But I didn't think nothing of it. And so once I finally went in, I was like, \"OK, I just want to know everything\"'.\n\nTo find the source of his pain, Wade's physician asked him to undergo an MRI of his kidney, stomach and prostate.\n\nThe scan showed a large mass on his kidney that doctors decided to immediately remove surgically - revealing the star athlete had kidney cancer.\n\nNBA legend Dwyane Wade has revealed how a routine check up for stomach pain led him to discover his kidney cancer diagnosis\n\nWade told TODAY: '[The doctor] expressed to me that it was very early, but they thought they saw something on my kidneys. I didn't go in for my kidneys. I went in to check what was going on my stomach and my prostate'.\n\nThe doctor suggested he undergo further scans speak to a specialist.\n\nHis second MRI scan also showed a 1.1 inch sized mass on one of his kidneys - prompting doctors to consider surgery to remove the lesion to prevent it from spreading.\n\nAfter the surgery, his physician told him his cancer was Stage 1.\n\nThe five year survival rate for Stage 1 kidney cancer is 93 percent.\n\nThe father-of-four recalled how panicked he felt after hearing he may have cancer and recalled battling with the decision to have a life-altering procedure.\n\nHe said: 'Immediately they try to say, 'Well, we don't know if it's cancerous, but it's something on there, and you're a young man, and we just want to make sure that, you obviously are able to live this healthy lifestyle'.\n\n'So now I'm processing the possibility of surgery on my kidneys. I've had it on my knees, I've had it on my shoulder, but it's something that feels a little realer when it's inside your body.\n\n'[My doctor said] in the next five or 10 years, if this is cancer, [it can] not only spread through your kidneys, but it [can] also spread through your lungs and eventually to your brain. That's when I knew that was, like, really serious.'\n\nKidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, is most commonly diagnosed in people 55 and 74 and men are more prone than women to develop the condition.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates about 81,610 were diagnosed with kidney cancer last year and 14,390 people died.\n\nThe 43-year-old former Miami Heat player shared that he had 40 percent of his kidney removed in December 2023 after finding a Stage 1 cancerous tumor\n\nTo understand the source of his pain, Wade's physician asked him to undergo an MRI scan over his kidney, stomach and prostate\n\nRisk factors for the cancer include smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease or family history.\n\nSymptoms may include blood in the urine, a lump in the abdomen or back pain, fever, weight loss and fatigue.\n\nThe most common form of kidney cancer treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nInvasive kidney surgery can involve removing part or all of a kidney and may also involve removing lymph nodes as well as other infected tissues.\n\nIn Wade's case, doctors performed a partial nephrectomy, removing about 40 percent of his kidney to ensure all the cancer was gone.\n\nA partial nephrectomy involves the removal of part of the kidney where the tumor is, while sparing the remainder from damage or removal.\n\nExperts conduct this procedure on those whose tumor is either less than 2.7 inches or if the patient only has one kidney.\n\nThe procedure can be performed using open surgery or minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy or robotics.\n\nWade pictured here with wife Gabrielle Union at the the Out100 Event 2024 at NeueHouse Hollywood on December 11, 2024\n\nDespite being in excruciating pain, Wade felt relieved and grateful for undergoing the procedure before the cancer could spread\n\nWhile a common procedure, some of the risks associated with partial nephrectomy include blood clots, infection, damage to the remaining kidney tissue and in some cases, kidney failure.\n\nIt typically takes several weeks to a few months for the kidney to fully heal and during this time, patients tend to experience some pain, swelling, and bruising in the area around the incision.\n\nDespite being in excruciating pain, Wade felt relieved and grateful for undergoing the procedure before the cancer could spread.\n\n'Thank God that we caught it early. This wasn't something that was able to grow.

      "text": "Dwyane Wade sculptor speaks out after statue was ripped by NBA fans and reveals how Heat legend really felt\n\nBy LEOCCIANO CALLAO\n\nPublished: 18:33 EDT, 28 October 2024 | Updated: 18:47 EDT, 3 December 2024\n\n45\n\nView comments\n\nAfter his Dwyane Wade statue was flamed by social media users, sculptor Omri Armany broke his silence about the criticism of his latest creation.\n\nOn Sunday, the eight-foot bust of the Miami Heat legend was unveiled outside Kaseya Center. However, many fans torched the sculpture for being off-base - claiming it looked nothing like the three-time champion it was meant to honor.\n\nSpeaking to Front Office Sports on Monday, Armany shared his reaction to the criticism and revealed Wade's meticulous involvement in the statue's creation.\n\n'I want to be an artist that creates an in-your-face response and you cannot expect all of human society will have a positive reaction,' Amrany told the outlet.\n\n'Some people will come with a goofy response or angry response. That's not because of what the art is itself, but rather how it makes them feel. So, if this is my part of being a psychologist, fine.'\n\nSculptor Omri Amany spoke up after his Dwyane Wade statue in Miami was heavily criticized\n\nFans torched the sculpture for not lookin like the three-time champion it was meant to honor\n\nMuch of the criticism was centered on the depiction of Wade's face. The statue drew comparisons to the infamous botched Cristiano Ronaldo statue unveiled in 2017. Armany's firm, Studio Rotblatt Armany, was not involved in the Ronaldo statue, which was revised thereafter.\n\nArmany worked with artist Oscar Leon on the sculpture and said many twisted Wade's remarks during the ceremony upon the statue's unveiling. He also revealed that the Hall of Famer visited their studio in his native Chicago several times during the building process.\n\n'He knew exactly what he wanted,' Amrany said. 'He was very happy with the piece. He was joking when he turned around and said, 'Who is this guy?' It was like, 'How did I get here where somebody made a sculpture for me?'\n\n'Some people took it like he didn't recognize his own sculpture, which is completely the opposite. It was just an expression. Sometimes people take the expression literally instead of trying to understand the depth of it.'\n\nWhile fans misinterpreted his initial comments, Wade called the statue 'beautiful' during Sunday's ceremony.\n\nWade posses next to his statue after Sunday's unveiling ceremony outside Kaseya Center\n\nWade called the bust 'beautiful' and was meticulously involved in the creative process\n\n'Personally, I'm biased, I think it's one of the best statues that's been created because of what it represents for us and for me,' Wade told the Miami Herald.\n\nWade's sculpture is the first to be erected outside Kaseya Center, the home of the Heat. Armany also shared the direct line between his most recent product and his most notable statue - the Michael Joran sculpture known as 'The Sprit' outside United Center in Chicago.\n\n'I was looking at this one as continuing a tradition,' Omri Amrany said. 'Dwyane was about 11 years old when his father took him to see the sculpture of Michael Jordan in Chicago after we unveiled it.\n\n'Now, Dwyane is part of the next generation who is getting the tribute,' He added. 'I would like to see another 11-year-old kid with his father inspired by this statue and, 20 or 30 years from now, will have his own statue unveiled.'\n\nWade played 13 of his 16 NBA seasons in Miami, making pitstops in Cleveland and Chicago\n\nThe basketball Hall of Famer won NBA championships with the Heat in 2006, 2012 and 2013\n\nThe Wade statue depicts his iconic 'this is my house' gesture after a double-overtime victory over the Bulls in the 2008-2009 regular season. The sculptor shared the challenges presented by Wade's celebration, compared to other works that portrayed action shots.\n\n'That's what makes things a little bit harder because, at the end of the day, you're still looking at hundreds of hundreds of pounds of bronze that has to be standing safely for many years to come,' Amrany said.\n\nAside from his Wade and Jordan statues, Armany was responsible for several sculptures outside Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. His creative hand brushed over the statues of Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, and the Kings' 50th Anniversary. A second Kobe Bryant statue, depicting the late Lakers Legend sitting courtside with his late daughter Gigi, was unveiled in August.\n\nStudio Rotblatt Armany has about 15 artists on their payroll and several projects on deck.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

'I wanted to feel this. Life goes by so fast and it's very rare that we get to feel things, because we're always off to the next thing. ... I wanted to feel this, man. I wanted to look at it.'\n\nHowever, NBA fans claimed there was one problem with the statue: It looked nothing like the icon.\n\nDwyane Wade became the first Miami Heat player with a statue outside the team's arena\n\nThe Heat unveiled the statue Sunday, sparking viral reactions from NBA fans online\n\nAs photos of the statue went viral on social media, fans were quick to mock the unveiling, swiftly turning it into new meme fodder.\n\n'Miami Heat did Dwyane Wade dirty,' one fan claimed on X, formerly known as Twitter , while another agreed, posting: 'Dwayne Wade's statue is some NASTY WORK.'\n\n'Shame on whoever greenlit this-it doesn't even look like Dwyane Wade. Y'all could've done better. This looks like a statue straight off Temu,' a third wrote, referencing the Chinese online shopping site.\n\nAnother echoed the bewilderment, saying: 'Honestly though, how'd that D Wade statue get cleared? When Dwayne Wade said \"who is that guy\" part of him had to be thinking, that's really the best y'all could do.'\n\n'The dwayne wade statue looks like hes riding a invisible motorcycle,' one joked, while another quipped, 'Damn, the Heat did Wade dirty. Gave him the Cristiano Ronaldo treatment,' referencing the viral statue of the Portuguese soccer star.\n\n'This statue is so bad it's making me forget what Dwayne Wade actually looks like. The longer I look, the harder it is for me to picture his real face,' one social media user shared.\n\n'Dwayne Wade trying to figure out who this statue is,' another joked alongside a photo of the former point guard looking up at the statue .\n\nFans on social media were quick to roast the statue of the former NBA point guard\n\nAn in-game celebration will follow Monday when Miami plays host to Detroit on the 21st anniversary of Wade's debut game with the franchise.\n\nWade, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, is one of six former Heat players to have their number retired by the team - along with Haslem, Chris Bosh, Tim Hardaway, Shaquille O'Neal and Alonzo Mourning.\n\n'As the greatest player ever in Miami Heat history, yes, it's his day, it's his family's day,' Riley said.\n\nThe statue is accompanied by a wall listing Wade's career accomplishments and has been placed outside the front doors of the team's arena. Wade is now a part-owner of the Utah Jazz in addition to having many other business interests.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), requires that prosecutors confer with government officials before interviewing current or former federal employees,\" Evans said.\n\nCLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION\n\nWade said he did not know or recall information dozens of times throughout the course of the interview.\n\nWade was brought into the Fulton County investigation by Willis as a special prosecutor but stepped away after it was revealed he and Willis began a romantic relationship , which has since ended.\n\nJordan has been seeking a committee sit-down with Wade for months over accusations that both he and Willis profited off of the probe during their relationship - something both circles have vehemently denied.\n\nBoth Willis and Wade have maintained that their relationship had nothing to do with the case and have accused Republicans of trying to unjustly interfere in the Fulton County probe.\n\nTrump was indicted by a grand jury in Fulton County DA Fani Willis' probe.

Wade subsequently resigned from the case.\n\nThe former special prosecutor was grilled by investigators for over four hours on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

She was accused by Trump and co-defendants of having an \"improper\" affair with Wade.\n\nOn March 15, Wade resigned after a Georgia judge gave Willis an ultimatum of either Willis or Wade quitting the case to move forward.\n\nJocelyn Wade, from whom Nathan Wade filed for divorce, alleged in Friday's court filing that due to her soon-to-be ex-husband's \"consistent failure to provide accurate or timely discovery or responses in this matter, [she] sought updated financial documentation from Fulton County regarding Plaintiff's employment as a Special Assistant District Attorney.\"\n\nNATHAN WADE SPEAKS OUT ON 'WORKPLACE ROMANCE' WITH FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS: 'AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE'\n\nEx-special prosecutor Nathan Wade sits in court during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v.

When repeatedly pressed about whether any records existed for her withdrawals of the funds, she said she was accustomed and taught by her father to keep six months of regular expenses on hand in cash.\n\nWade took the stand earlier in the hearing. Craig Gillen, attorney for Trump co-defendant David Shafer who also asked the court to disqualify Willis, questioned Wade earlier about Willis' repayments to him for vacations that had been made in cash.\n\nWade admitted that he did not have deposit slips or receipts to support his claims.\n\n\"You don't have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash, do you?\" Gillen asked. \"No, sir,\" Wade said.\n\n\"Not a single solitary one,\" Gillen pressed. \"Not a one.\"\n\nWillis, in her testimony, called Wade a \"southern gentleman.\" Willis said her relationship with Wade ended roughly last summer but that the two remain \"very good friends\" and are \"probably closer than ever because of these attacks.\"\n\nBoth Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former \"good friend\" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office. Yeartie said she had \"no doubt\" the Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.\n\nYeartie testified to observing Willis and Wade \"hugging\" and \"kissing\" and showing \"affection\" prior to November 2021, and that she had no doubt that the two were in a \"romantic\" relationship starting in 2019, to when she and Willis last spoke in 2022.\n\nWillis dismissed Yeartie's testimony and said she no longer considers Yeartie to be a friend.\n\nBrianna Herlihy is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "How Inspiring: Harris Says She Thought About Roe v Wade Being Overturned 'As the Daughter of a Woman'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is not known for her great and moving oratory skills.\n\nWe are frequently treated to cringe-worthy responses that are nonsensical, or seem as though she is desperately trying to string together a sentence that sounds profound without considering if it actually means anything.\n\nBut during an exclusive interview with CNN, her propensity for spewing out words that mean nothing was once again on full display.\n\n\"When you think about it, in terms of what that means in terms of democratic principles in terms of the ideals upon which we were founded about liberty, about freedom. You know, I thought about it as, you know, a parent, we have two children who are in their twenties - a son and a daughter. I thought about as a godparent of teenagers. I thought of it as an aunt of pre-school children,\" Harris said.\n\nShe was doing reasonably OK until CNN's Dana Bash interjected to add that Harris is a woman.\n\nAt that point, Harris then decided to run with that idea which apparently seemed like a profound concept, and as usual, it ended poorly.\n\n\"And a woman myself,\" the vice president repeated. \"And the daughter of a woman, and a granddaughter of a woman.\"\n\nUnless Harris is insisting that men can give birth and that either she or her mother might have been birthed by a man, that sentence is utterly useless.\n\nKamala Harris says that when Roe was overturned, she thought of it as \"a woman myself, and the daughter of a woman, and a granddaughter of a woman.\" pic.twitter.com/c9aH5TctFc - Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 27, 2022\n\nKamala Harris says that when Roe was overturned, she thought of it as \"a woman myself, and the daughter of a woman, and a granddaughter of a woman.\" pic.twitter.com/c9aH5TctFc\n\nWhile it is 2022, Harris was inaugurated and celebrated as the first woman vice president so her gender identity does not seem to be in question. And Bash's decision to point out that Harris is a woman seems odd.\n\nIndeed, the look on Harris' face immediately after her little tangent appears to show she knew that it wasn't good.\n\nIt's unclear why Bash interjected to add the part about Harris being a woman herself. The vice president seemed to be going along just fine until she felt the need to interrupt.\n\nAt that point, Harris seized on the idea and went off the rails for a few seconds.\n\nThe interview comes after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , as IJR reported .\n\nShockingly, Harris seems entirely unprepared to respond to the decision despite essentially having more than a month to prepare.\n\nInstead, we have gotten this response and a picture of her watching TV on a plane.\n\nIJR, Senior Writer\r\nHe's written for Independent Journal Review since 2019.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "SCOTUS Judge: US on Par With 'People's Republic of China and North Korea' Over Roe v. Wade\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 02: The U.S. Supreme Court is seen on September 02, 2021 in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court voted 5-4 not to stop a Texas law that prohibits most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nLast week the Supreme Court heard the oral arguments for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case that could become the new precedent for American abortion laws.\n\nDuring the arguments , Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that the U.S.'s current abortion laws, set by the seminal Roe v. Wade decision, puts our nation in the same category as countries like North Korea and China.\n\n\"When you get to the viability standard, we share that standard with the People's Republic of China and North Korea,\" Roberts said.\n\nAccording to the precedent set in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, fetal viability begins around 24 weeks of pregnancy, so abortions are allowed up to that point.\n\nThis Mississippi case really comes down to an argument over defining fetal viability. The Mississippi law currently being debated prohibits abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nSetting fetal viability at 15 weeks would actually put the U.S. more in line with European and other western countries, rather than with the oppressive regimes of North Korea and China.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute found in 2018 that \"47 out of 50 European countries analyzed in this report either do not allow elective abortion or limit elective abortion to 15 weeks or earlier, whereas 0 out of 50 states in the U.S. limit elective abortion to 15 weeks.\"\n\nMost European countries begin limiting abortions after 12 weeks.\n\n\"The majority of European countries that allow elective abortion limit it to 12 weeks. This finding demonstrates that Mississippi's law limiting elective abortion to 15 weeks is neither extreme nor outside the norm in comparison to European practice,\" the study found.\n\nThe only three European countries that allow abortions after 15 weeks are Iceland (22 weeks), Netherlands (24 weeks), and Sweden (18 weeks).\n\n\"The Mississippi late-term abortion restriction at 15 weeks is not extreme by any measure when compared with European law,\" the institute said.\n\nRoberts recognized this during the oral arguments.\n\n\"I'd like to focus on the 15-week ban because that's not a dramatic departure from viability. It is the standard that the vast majority of other countries have,\" the chief justice said.\n\nJulie Rikelman, who argued for Jackson Women's Health Organization, then explained that European countries allow access to abortion right up to viability.\n\n\"So, for example, Canada, Great Britain and most of Europe allows access to abortion right up until viability, and it also doesn't have the same barriers in place,\" Rikelman said.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that European countries' window before viability is shorter than America's.\n\nSo redefining the timeline for viability was more at the heart of the issue, rather than just the right to abortion. That is what Roberts began to highlight with his questions.\n\nRoberts continued to question the arguments behind the \"right\" to abortion. He questioned whether freedom of choice really had anything to do with the question of fetal viability, which seems to be more what Dobbs. v Jackson was focused on.\n\n\"If you think that the issue is one of choice, that women should have a choice to terminate their pregnancy, that supposes that there is a point at which they've had the fair choice, opportunity to choice, and why would 15 weeks be an inappropriate line?\" Roberts asked. \"Because viability, it seems to me, doesn't have anything to do with choice. But, if it really is an issue about choice, why is 15 weeks not enough time?\"\n\nSo the argument over abortion laws right now really comes down to what it's always been: When does a human become a human? And what is a human?\n\nThe lives of millions of unborn babies is relying on court officials to define human life.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Woman Faces Potentially Life-Threatening Complications After Abortionist Leaves Behind Half Of Dead Baby, Lawsuit Says\n\nA woman filed a lawsuit Friday against an Illinois abortion clinic after enduring severe and dangerous complications from an allegedly botched late-term abortion that her lawyers claim left half of the deceased baby in her womb.\n\nThe woman, referred to as Jane Doe in the legal complaint , is suing Dr. Keith Reisinger-Kindle and Equity Clinic after suffering severe complications from a 22-week abortion performed at the clinic, the lawsuit alleges. The state of Illinois, where the clinic is located, prides itself on being \"an island for reproductive justice\" and has drastically expanded abortion access while offering limited safety regulations .\n\nRichard Craig, an attorney for the plaintiff, confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation that if left untreated, the complications Doe suffered from the abortion could have been life-threatening.\n\nDuring the abortion, which occurred on April 2, 2023, no medication was administered to end the life of the unborn baby before the suction procedure began, the lawsuit stated.\n\n\"Someone who's performing this has an option of dismembering this baby part by part, while it is alive, or administering to digoxin, which would stop the fetal heart and then the baby's demise would occur before the dismemberment,\" Craig told the DCNF. \"There was no administration of pain relief or anything like that. And a child at age 22 [weeks of pregnancy], it's just a scientific fact, those children feel pain.\"\n\nThe following day, Doe called the clinic twice to report heavy cramping and pressure that made it \"hard to breathe,\" for which she was advised to take over-the-counter painkillers and laxatives, according to the lawsuit. The patient contacted the clinic again the next day, April 4, with the same symptoms and was later admitted to a hospital in Indiana.\n\nThe hospital discovered the woman had \"half of a deceased pre-born human being\" remaining in her uterus as well as \"pieces of the fetal skull that were adherent to the patient's intestine,\" which required surgery to remove, the lawsuit said. The patient's uterus was also perforated.\n\nReisinger-Kindle allegedly refused to answer questions or provide information regarding the original abortion to hospital staff when contacted on April 5, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Reisinger-Kindle and the Equity Clinic of medical negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nThe patient also accused Reisinger-Kindle of intentional infliction of emotional distress due to a phone call the two shared on April 5 during which Doe asked if her baby was a boy or girl, and the doctor responded by saying he would \"check again\" despite knowing the fetal remains were already discarded, the suit alleges, saying Reisinger-Kindle's response was \"outrageous, exceeded all bounds of human decency, and is intolerable in a civilized society.\"\n\n\"She does regret it, and I think that that regret set in the moment she wanted to learn whether she would have had a boy or a girl,\" Craig informed the DCNF.\n\nAn expert testimony provided for the lawsuit by a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist with experience performing late-term abortions added that due to Reisinger-Kindle's alleged errors, the patient may suffer complications with any future pregnancy and delivery.\n\n\"It has been terrible emotionally for [the patient], and I think that part of that emotional injury starts from the way that [Reisinger-Kindle] treated her even after he learned that he had performed so poorly,\" Craig told the DCNF. \"It's unlikely that she'll ever be able to deliver, except for by cesarean section, if she's ever even able to deliver at all. That part of her life may be over. And there's that emotional injury too, but I think that the callous nature in which he treated her afterwards - he never had her back ever, and she knows that now and and that hurts.\"\n\nEquity Clinic's website claims that the clinic offers late-term abortions up to 24-weeks of pregnancy and same-day appointments; it also hosts a swath of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training in \" anti-bias and anti-oppression/anti-racism \" for staff.\n\n\"'Late term abortion' is not a medical term but a commonly used political term to shame people who terminate pregnancies in the 2nd and 3rd trimester,\" the clinic's website reads. \"At Equity Clinic, we understand that there can be a lot of judgment put on our patients, and because of this we prefer to avoid using language like 'late term abortion' and use the specific trimester the pregnancy is in (ie. first, second, or third), or the name of the specific procedure (like 'Dilation and Evacuation') when referring to abortion procedures.\"\n\nAbortion in Illinois is legal up until fetal viability, around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDemocrat Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed an abortion shield law in 2023 protecting medical professionals from legal trouble for providing abortions and expanding the ability to perform the procedure to advanced practice registered nurses and physicians assistants.\n\n\"Here in Illinois, we hold certain ideals: abortion is health care. A medical decision should be made between a patient and their doctor - no one else,\" Pritzker said in the announcement. \"Last summer, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, I made a promise that Illinois would remain a beacon of hope and an island for reproductive justice for all who seek it. This bill fulfills that promise.\"\n\nIllinois also has few regulations around abortion, with no specific laws governing the standards of clinics or minimum distance they can be away from a hospital in case of complications, according to KFF.\n\n\"It is a very unregulated area of medicine, and it's the lack of regulation that would allow for something like this to occur,\" Craig said. \"There's very little in the way of oversight in this field, and I think that it's a field that likes it that way.\"\n\nReisinger-Kindle and Equity Clinic did not respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "JD Vance Tells Catholics That Trump Administration Has Already Taken Ax To Biden's Anti-Christian Policies\n\nVice President J.D. Vance assured Catholics during Friday's National Prayer Breakfast that President Donald Trump's administration has already erased the previous administration's anti-Christian policies.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration prosecuted pro-life Christians and targeted traditional Catholics under the suspicion that they were extremists and were susceptible to having a \"white supremacist ideology.\" During the breakfast, Vance said that Trump, though he is not himself a Catholic, has taken multiple actions to protect Catholic and Christian Americans from being targeted by federal officials.\n\n\"I feel very confident in saying that between protecting the rights of pro-life protesters, between ensuring that we have an opportunity to protect the rights of the unborn in the first place and most importantly, protecting the religious liberty of all people, but in particular Catholics,\" Vance said. \"I think we can say that President Trump, though not a Catholic himself, has been an incredibly good president for Catholics in the United States of America.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nThe vice president criticized the Biden administration for prosecuting pro-life activists who prayed and protested outside of abortion clinics. Under the Biden administration, at least 15 FBI agents raided the home of Catholic pro-life activist Mark Houck in Oct. 2022 and arrested him for allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act over an altercation between himself and Planned Parenthood abortion clinic escort, Bruce Love.\n\nHouck, who faced up to 11 years in prison and pleaded not guilty to the charges, stated he was defending his 12-year-old son from verbal harassment and pushed away Love in the process, according to the Catholics News Agency. A jury found Houck not guilty of all the charges in January 2023.\n\nIn a separate case, the FBI retracted a leaked memo from the Richmond field office in 2023 that considered infiltrating groups of Roman Catholics who prefer Latin mass due to their supposed potential of committing \"violence.\" The document accused traditional Catholics, who attend the pre-1970 Latin Mass, as being susceptible to \"anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ and white supremacist ideology.\"\n\nVance further said that the Trump administration is taking steps to prevent late-term abortions. Despite Biden identifying himself as a \"devout Catholic,\" both himself and officials in his administration repeatedly refused to say at what point in a pregnancy an abortion should no longer be permitted.\n\n\"On every single one of those issues, in 30 short days, Donald J. Trump has gone in the exact opposite direction and I am thankful for that and I'm sure every single person in this room is thankful for that as well,\" Vance said.\n\nThe vice president further said that Trump's efforts to bring world peace by ending wars will bring more religious freedom to Christians on a global scale. The president said he is currently involved in negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about ending the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBiden came under scrutiny by Catholic priests and clergy for his support for abortion and could face excommunication in the church for joining a historically black Freemason lodge just one day before he left the presidency. Father Robert E. Morey denied communion to Biden at Saint Anthony Catholic Church in South Carolina in 2019 over his stance on abortion.\n\nThe former president supported changing the filibuster in order to codify Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned in June 2022 to return abortion laws to the states.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Really Hard To Accept': Hillary Clinton Rips Dems For Being Asleep At Wheel In Years Leading Up To Dobbs Decision\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Democrats for being \"complacent\" about abortion prior to Roe v. Wade being overturned in an interview for an upcoming book.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 after upholding a Mississippi law in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that banned most abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. During the interview, Clinton assigned blame widely, but excluded herself from criticism, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"We didn't take it seriously, and we didn't understand the threat,\" Clinton said during the interview. \"Most Democrats, most Americans, did not realize we are in an existential struggle for the future of this country.\"\n\nClinton lost the 2016 election to Republican nominee Donald Trump, who eventually nominated Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, all of whom voted with the majority in the Dobbs decision. Clinton accused Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett, along with Chief Justice John Roberts, of lying during their Senate confirmation hearings.\n\n\"It is really hard to believe that people are going to lie to you under oath, that even so-called conservative justices would upend precedents to arrive at ridiculous decisions on gun rights and campaign finance and abortion,\" she said. \"It's really hard to accept that.\"\n\n\"They flat-out lied,\" she added. \"And Democrats did nothing in the Senate.\"\n\nClinton also criticized Democrats for not doing more to counter the Federalist Society in the interview.\n\n\"I just think that most of us who support the rights of women and privacy and the right to make these difficult decisions yourself, you know, we just couldn't believe what was happening. And as a result, they slowly, surely and very effectively got what they wanted,\" she said. \"Our side was complacent and kind of taking it for granted and thinking it would never go away.\"\n\nClinton also claimed that American democracy was at risk should Trump win the 2024 election. Trump leads Biden by 1.1% in the RealClearPolitics average of general election polls for a head-to-head matchup as of Saturday, with the lead growing to 2.4% when Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent candidates Cornel West and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included.\n\n\"This election is existential. I mean, if we don't make the right decision in this election in our country, we may never have another actual election. I will put that out there because I believe it,\" Clinton claimed. \"And if we no longer have another actual election, we will be governed by a small minority of right-wing forces that are well organized and well funded and are getting exactly what they want in terms of turning the clock back on women.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The draft, obtained by Politico, was written by Justice Samuel Alito, and has been circulated inside the conservative-dominated court, the news outlet reported. Politico stressed that the document it obtained is a draft and opinions could change. The court is expected to issue a decision by June. The draft opinion calls the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision \"egregiously wrong from the start.\" (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe majority of Americans believe Roe v. Wade should be upheld by the Supreme Court, according to a poll.\n\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was published just one day after Politico released a report showing the Supreme Court is expected to overturn the decision.\n\nFifty-seven percent of Americans say there should be a ban on abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nFifty-eight percent believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nAccording to the poll, 54% say the decision should be upheld while 28% believe it should be overturned.\n\nSeven in 10 think the decision to have an abortion should be left between the woman and her doctor.\n\nTwenty-four percent of Americans believe abortion should be regulated by law.\n\nThe poll was conducted between April 24 to 28 and surveyed 1,004 adults.\n\nBREAKING: A majority of Americans support upholding Roe v.

      "text": "Nathan Wade: Fani Willis Planned Trump Prosecution Before Taking Office, Formed 'Search Committee'\n\nOAN Staff Brooke Mallory 2:09 PM - Monday, October 21, 2024\n\nAccording to a transcript made public on Monday, Nathan Wade told Congress in a closed-door deposition that before taking office in January 2021, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was already planning to bring charges against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the transcript of the deposition, which was conducted by the House Judiciary Committee last week, Wade stated that Willis started reaching out to form a search committee related to Trump's case before she took office on January 1, 2021, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\n\"And was there outreach to you to be part of the search committee prior to January 1, 2021?\" a committee lawyer asked Nathan Wade in the deposition.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Wade said in response, noting that the efforts began \"sometime after the [2020] election, but prior to her taking office.\"\n\nThe district attorney's early, ongoing motivation in targeting Trump and certain challenges related to the 2020 election were highlighted by Wade's statements. He explained that Willis contacted him prior to the day she took office in order to organize him and others to prosecute the former president for allegedly \"trying to rig the election.\"\n\nWade further explained in his testimony that the search committee's members were looking for someone who had no obvious or public \"axe to grind\" against Trump when they started their investigation. Eventually, they asked Wade to take on the position of lead prosecutor in the Trump case.\n\n\"So, January 1st, I was a part of the search committee for that newly elected district attorney, and we were tasked with trying to identify someone who would serve as lead counsel on the election interference investigation,\" Wade stated, according to the transcript. \"Eventually, I guess the committee turned their guns on me and started trying to convince me to accept the role.\"\n\nHowever, following the discovery of a secret romantic relationship between Wade and Willis by the former president and some of his co-defendants, Wade withdrew from the Trump case this year after a judge's ultimatum forced the two to decide who steps down.\n\nWade resigned from the Trump case after the defendants argued that the relationship between the two exemplified a clear conflict of interest in the case, and a court partially agreed. Trump then took his case to the Georgia Court of Appeals in an attempt to have Willis removed from the case.\n\nAs part of the investigation into their apparent conflict of interest, Wade and Willis were forced to answer questions about their affair earlier this year. Although evidence shown during the investigation indicated they had a close personal relationship before then, both claimed their connection only started in early 2022, after a grand jury investigation investigating Trump was already well underway.\n\nWade was also questioned by the House Judiciary Committee over his meetings with attorneys in President Joe Biden's White House, and with members of the now-dissolved Jan. 6 Committee.\n\nWade has not disclosed any information regarding the meetings, including who attended or their purpose, despite the fact that they came to light via court documents this year. He also claimed repeatedly during his deposition that he was unable to remember the specifics or any real details, as his lawyer nodded.\n\n\"I do not recall,\" Wade said when asked about a meeting with White House counsel back in 2022. \"You know, during the course of this investigation, we interviewed probably hundreds of people, tons of conversations.\"\n\nAlthough there are technically no illegalities involved with local prosecutors requesting evidence from Congress or speaking with White House attorneys, the mystery surrounding Wade's conversations with the federal government has sparked speculation that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's allies were politically motivated to work with Wade in order to bring charges against Trump.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: Nathan Wade admitted to multiple White House meetings during Trump Georgia probe in an interview by House Judiciary Committee staff pic.twitter.com/0Jra0AKLV9\n\nHis deposition is a component of the year-long inquiry into Willis's prosecution of Trump by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), who is leading the efforts.\n\nJordan, a supporter of Trump, has maintained that Willis's investigation exposes unprofessional political overtones, at the very least. He has persisted in casting doubt on Willis's use of federal grant funds, pointing out that her office provided Wade with financial support for over two years, during which she had a relationship with him.\n\nNevertheless, Willis has still denied on numerous occasions that he misused grant funds or that she had political objectives.\n\nToday we released the transcript of Nathan Wade's deposition before the House Judiciary Committee.

Amid the discovery, one of Trump's co-defendants, Michael Roman, filed a motion seeking the disqualification of Willis and her team on the interference case due to her \"improper\" relationship with Wade.\n\nAt first, Willis and Wade remained silent about the charges and did not confirm or deny the reported relationship. Jocelyn Wade served Willis with a notice of deposition on January 8 th . In response, Willis charged Joycelyn with meddling in the Trump legal matter.\n\nThe Wades settled their divorce out-of-court before Willis was set to testify.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court then oversaw several days of testimony regarding Roman's initial motion and motions of other defendants, including Trump.\n\nNathan and Willis defended their innocence, claiming that neither their relationship nor their participation in the Georgia election meddling case brought them any financial gain.\n\nJudge McAfee decided after these proceedings that in order for the case to move forward, Willis or Nathan had to recuse themselves. In his decision, McAfee stated that Wade's unconvincing justification for the false interrogatories he submitted in his impending divorce suggested a willingness on his part to improperly conceal his relationship with Willis.\n\nHe also noted that there was still a \"odor of mendacity\" surrounding the case. Nathan then resigned from his position just hours after the ruling was finalized.\n\nJoycelyn's urgent need for medical procedures, such as an ultrasound, colonoscopy, and endoscopy, is highlighted in the most recent filing. Despite a court order requiring him to pay the healthcare provider directly, Nathan allegedly told his ex-wife to pay the bills herself and that he would reimburse her later.\n\nNathan is also accused of discounting financial support for their children when he allegedly informed their daughter, who is currently in college, that he would not cover her rent or living expenses any longer. The filing stated that he only told his daughter on the day that her rent was due and reneged on his commitment to pay for her MCAT expenses.\n\nEven though Nathan had promised to cover their son's expenses to obtain a visa, he also informed their son he will need to seek financial support from his mother.\n\nJoycelyn claims that since she is now raising all of their children, Nathan's sudden termination of support has left her in severe financial hardship, with a monthly income of less than $1,000.\n\nFurthermore, it has been reported that Nathan owes Joycelyn's financial advisor at least $15,000, and his failure to pay the outstanding balance has exacerbated the financial strain.\n\nStay informed!

The motion filed by Michael Roman, the former Trump campaign staffer who brought the topic to the court, alleged that the romance began while Wade was still married to Joycelyn Wade.\n\nThe two have since filed for divorce.\n\nIt is important to note that the paperwork was filled the day after Willis appointed Wade to oversee Fulton County's probe into Donald Trump and his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 Georgia election results.\n\nLawyers for Willis did not deny the personal relationship, however, they stated that the efforts to disqualify their client from the high-profile case has \"no merit\" and \"should be summarily denied without an evidentiary hearing.\"\n\n\"While the allegations raised in the various motions are salacious and garnered the media attention they were designed to obtain, none provide this Court with any basis upon which to order the relief they seek,\" the filing from Willis' attorneys said.\n\nThe lawyer went on to say that their client never benefited financially from Wade and the almost $650,000 she paid him as part of the prosecution team for the case was not related to their relationship.\n\n\"To be absolutely clear, the personal relationship between Special Prosecutor Wade and District Attorney Willis has never involved direct or indirect financial benefit to District Attorney Willis,\" the filing read.\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys for Wade denied any conflict of interest. He insisted that their relationship began in 2022 and not in 2021 like Roman was suggesting.\n\n\"In 2022, District Attorney Willis and I developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship,\" Wade said in court documents. \"I have no financial interest in the outcome of the 2020 election interference case or in the conviction of any defendant.\"\n\nThe 45 th president was quick to weigh in on his social media platform Truth Social when the news broke.\n\n\"Fani Willis, the D.A. of Fulton County, just admitted to having a sexual relationship with the Prosecutor she, in consultation with the White House and DOJ, appointed to 'GET PRESIDENT DONALD J.

THAT MEANS THAT THIS SCAM IS TOTALLY DISCREDITED & OVER!\" he continued.\n\nCurrently, Willis is still leading the case to prosecute Trump in Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nTrump is facing 13 charges in Georgia. Willis charged the 45 th president with violating the Georgia RICO Act, solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiring to impersonate a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery in the first degree, and conspiring to file false documents.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.\n\nStay informed!

In early January, he accused Willis and special prosecutor Nathan Wade of having a secretive relationship beyond their professional work.\n\nThe prosecution wasted no time and asked Wade a range of private details regarding his \"personal relationship\" with Willis.\n\nDuring the stunning testimony, it was revealed that the intimate relationship between the duo began in 2022.\n\n\"Let's be clear: 2022 was the start of any intimate sexual relationship with the district attorney,\" Wade said.\n\nHowever, that date contradicts the testimony from an ex-friend of Willis who stated earlier that day that the affair began back in 2019, three years earlier than he claimed. Her ex-friend, Robin Yeartie, told the court that she believed that there was \"no doubt\" they were in a romantic relationship prior to his hiring.\n\nIn Yeartie's testimony, she stated that Willis had informed her about seeing Wade during a 2019 court session.\n\n\"Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade began their romantic relationship soon after,\" she said under questioning.\n\n\"Did you observe them do things that are common among people having a romantic relationship,\" another lawyer asked.\n\n\"Hugging, kissing, just affection,\" said Yeartie.\n\nWade testified that the last time he was intimate with the district attorney was in the summer of 2023.\n\nAs being the special prosecutor in the county's case against the 45 th president, Wade and Willis \"personally benefited\" from the relationship as he was paid $654,000 by the county for his role in assisting her office to prosecute Trump.\n\nWade took many personal vacation trips with Willis while working for her. Some of their vacations included trips to Aruba, Tennessee, and Napa Valley in California. Wade would typically book the trips for the pair.\n\nHe claimed that Willis always paid for her part of the trip after it was booked. She would \"only reimburse him in cash.\"\n\n\"For safety reasons, she would limit her transactions,\" Wade said. \"I used my business card for everything,\" he said of his transactions.\n\nJUST IN: Trump prosecutor Nathan Wade says he paid for trips with DA Fani Willis on his business card which she then reimbursed him in cash.

      "text": "Life Wins: Supreme Court Strikes Down Roe v. Wade\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade decision Friday, ending constitutional protection for abortion.\n\nThe historic decision returns regulation of the procedure to the states, many of which have amended their laws in recent months in anticipation of the decision. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the majority opinion for five justices over dissents from the liberal trio. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion declining to overturn Roe but advancing new restrictions on abortion.\n\n\"Abortion presents a profound moral question,\" the decision reads. \"The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nFriday's result is the end of one of the most extraordinary cases in the Court's history. The ruling appears to closely track a draft majority opinion that leaked from the Court in May, an unprecedented and once-unthinkable breach of Court customs. The ensuing weeks saw a rise in threats against members of the Court and the attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, thought to hold the swing vote in the case.\n\nYet for all the drama of recent months, overturning Roe may not prove to be a tumultuous political event. With inflation soaring and a recession looming, abortion is not registering as a top concern for voters. Legislative action is not expected from Congress, where Democratic majorities in both houses are too slim for drastic measures. And while President Joe Biden is expected to counter the ruling via executive action, the options available to him are modest, such as relaxing regulations governing abortion pills.\n\nThe president acknowledged that his options are limited in a statement Friday calling on voters to elect pro-abortion lawmakers this fall. The president also urged demonstrators to exercise restraint when protesting in the coming days.\n\n\"I call on all people ... to keep all protests peaceful. No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable. Threats and intimidation are not speech,\" Biden said.\n\nLeft-wing groups behind demonstrations at the homes of justices vowed to foment a \"night of rage\" following Friday's decision. Those threats track a Homeland Security Department warning about targeted violence against justices, clergy, and healthcare providers following the leak of a draft majority opinion in Friday's case. A gunman was arrested near Kavanaugh's home on June 8.\n\nThere have been almost 50 instances of violence, vandalism, or intimidation at pro-life clinics and houses of worship, according to a June 16 report from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. Some illegal acts have targeted the Court itself. The radical progressive group #ShutdownDC blocked the Court's vehicle entrances for several hours on Monday June 13, hoping to keep personnel from the building and \"expand the current political crisis.\"\n\nThe decision immediately affects the legal status of abortion across the country. Thirteen states have \"trigger bans\" in place, which will take effect in a matter of days or weeks. The largest of those 13 states is Texas, where legal abortions declined by as much as 50 percent following enactment of a fetal heartbeat law in 2021. Another 13 states have pre- Roe bans on abortion that were never taken off the books, or restrictions on the procedure following a certain gestational age.\n\nA majority of the states-26 in total-urged the justices to overturn Roe in amicus briefs filed in Friday's case.\n\nThe Constitution protects certain rights not mentioned in the text, provided they are deeply rooted in the tradition of the nation. But there is no such tradition respecting abortion, the majority said Tuesday. Alito's opinion includes a thorough survey of English, Founding-era, and 19th century laws and found that \"prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973,\" the year Roe was decided. That history demonstrates abortion is not among the \"unenumerated\" rights the Constitution protects, the opinion states.\n\nLeft-wing critics of the leaked majority opinion warned it will imperil other personal autonomy landmarks, such as the right to contraception and same-sex marriage. Alito distinguished Friday's ruling from those decisions. Abortion is different, he said, because it involves a defenseless third party.\n\n\"None of the other decisions ... involved the critical moral question posed by abortion,\" he wrote. \"They are therefore inapposite.\"\n\nFriday's decision is a testament to the fortitude of the Court's conservative majority. The opinion contains only a few minor changes compared to the draft that leaked in May. Targeted demonstrations and grave security threats did not affect the outcome or the substance of the ruling.\n\nAs states pass new laws governing access to abortion, lawfare among pro-life and pro-abortion states will eventually reach the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, likely to be a decisive player in those disputes, staked a pair of important positions in a separate opinion. He said a state cannot stop its citizens from traveling to another state to terminate a pregnancy. And he warned that the states cannot punish physicians for abortions performed before Friday's ruling.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan wrote a joint dissent that pointedly needled former president Donald Trump's three appointees. They said the law should not change with the composition of the Court. And they lamented, quoting a prior dissent, \"that so few have so quickly changed so much.\"\n\n\"No one should be confident that this majority is done with its work,\" they wrote.\n\nThe case is No. 19-1392 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Center .\n\nUpdate 1:45 p.m.: This piece has been updated with additional information.\n\nPublished under: Abortion , Amy Coney Barrett , Feature , Mitch McConnell , Roe v.

      "text": "Georgia Court To Consider Trump's Request That Fani Willis Be Disqualified\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted Donald Trump's request that the court review a previous ruling that had allowed Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting election interference charges against the former president.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants had attempted to have Willis disqualified from the case, alleging that her affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest and that Willis had improperly benefited from the relationship.\n\nWillis claimed that their romantic relationship did not begin until after she had appointed Wade to the case in 2021, despite testimony from witnesses that it began in 2019.\n\nFulton County Superior Court judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willis would be allowed to stay on the case, but that Wade would have to be removed, due to the \"appearance of impropriety.\" Wade resigned hours later, allowing the case to proceed.\n\nTrump attorney Steve Sadow said in a statement that the former president \"looks forward\" to arguing why Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe appeal is likely to delay the case, increasing the possibility it will not be brought to trial before the November presidential election.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Corruption , Donald Trump , Election Integrity , Ethics , Fani Willis , Georgia\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Snitches Get Stitches: From Young Thug to Fani Willis, Star Witnesses Clam Up in Bombshell Georgia Cases\n\nOn Tuesday, Nathan Wade's former divorce lawyer, Terrence Bradley, took the stand to testify on the special prosecutor's relationship with Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis.\n\nThe star witness was expected to divulge incriminating information on the origins of Bradley and Willis's relationship. Instead, he clammed up periodically.\n\nBradley's performance mirrored that of another Georgia star witness, Trontavious Stephens, who testified last month in a racketeering case against Atlanta rapper Young Thug. Stephens testified that he could not recall key conversations related to the case-and also said he did not know the meaning of the word \"snitch.\"\n\nPublished under: Donald Trump , Georgia\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Fani Willis Admits Affair With Prosecutor in Trump Case\n\nFulton County district attorney Fani Willis (D.) admitted to having a personal relationship with a special prosecutor she appointed to an election subversion case against former president Donald Trump, according to admissions Willis made in a Friday court filing reported by the Washington Post .\n\nWillis's prosecution of Trump has come under fire amid allegations that she had an affair with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor, thus prejudicing her case. The district attorney's filing included an affidavit from Wade, in which he said that the two developed a personal relationship in 2022, though the filing stressed that it began after his 2021 appointment.\n\nWhile she admitted to the relationship, allegations of which first came to light in Wade's divorce proceedings, she denied allegations of prosecutorial impropriety, calling them \"meritless\" and \"salacious\" in the filing.\n\nAshleigh Merchant-an attorney for one of Trump's codefendants, Mike Roman- alleged that Wade took Willis on lavish vacations after the former's appointment and that the two have a conflict of interest, which is grounds for the dismissal of the case. The judge overseeing the case scheduled a hearing on the allegations for Feb. 15, at which Willis and Wade have been subpoenaed to appear, though it is likely they will fight them.\n\nFriday's filing is the first time that either of the two has addressed the allegations of a romantic relationship and impropriety surrounding it, though Willis did allude to them at a mid-January speech at a historic Atlanta black church, implying that racism played a role in their being targeted.\n\nWillis's admission came days after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she fired a whistleblower who notified her of the misuse of federal grant money in her office. That news has resulted in multiple probes into Willis's alleged actions as well as a congressional subpoena .\n\nPublished under: 2020 Election , Donald Trump , Fani Willis , Georgia\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
