(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump .\n\nThe decision leaves Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary . This is the scenario Trump's foes in the GOP have long sought, raising the stakes for this week's contest as the party's last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.\n\nBut as some Trump critics cheered, DeSantis nodded toward Trump's primary dominance - and attacked Haley - in an exit video he posted on social media.\n\n\"It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,\" DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone.\n\nHe continued: \"I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.\"\n\nGet insider access to the campaign trail, Washington and more with Ground Game, featuring exclusive reporting on politics and the 2024 race from the AP's Meg Kinnard. Sign up here .\n\nHaley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as DeSantis announced his decision.\n\n\"He ran a great race, he's been a good governor, and we wish him well,\" she told a room packed with supporters and media. \"Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.\"\n\nDeSantis' decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa , marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Trump's supremacy in the Republican Party. After months of contentious exchanges, Trump struck a more conciliatory tone late Sunday during a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, calling DeSantis a \"really terrific person.\"\n\n\"I also look forward to working with Ron\" to win the general election, Trump said.\n\nDeSantis entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $130 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.\n\nSuch advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses - which he had vowed to win - by 30 percentage points to Trump.\n\nDeSantis' allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.\n\nThe Florida governor notified top donors and supporters of his decision through a series of phone conversations and text messages between senior campaign officials to top donors and supporters on Sunday afternoon, according to two people who received such communications. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversations.\n\nDeSantis had returned to Florida by then after a roller-coaster weekend that included stops in South Carolina ahead of an event in New Hampshire Sunday evening that was ultimately canceled. The campaign also canceled a series of national television appearances earlier in the day, blaming the cancelation on a miscommunication with DeSantis' super PAC.\n\nDeSantis was physically worn after spending weeks on the campaign with little, if any, time off, even as he stormed across frigid Iowa and New Hampshire, often without a winter coat.\n\nHe ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Trump given his popularity in the party despite the deeply personal feud between them.\n\n\"While I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,\" said DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida's governor, which ends in January 2027.\n\nThe endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for DeSantis, whom Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.\n\nFor Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staffers, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy. Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality, and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.\n\nDeSantis' team joined Trump in attacking Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape. Some doubt Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head matchup between Trump, would benefit from DeSantis' decision.\n\n\"She will not be the nominee,\" key DeSantis supporter Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told AP. \"She will not be the president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump had already shifted his focus to Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after DeSantis' announcement, the former president's campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Haley to win New Hampshire.\n\n\"Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire - there are only two options,\" wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\n\"Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,\" they wrote. \"Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARRASSED in her home state of South Carolina,\" which votes on Feb. 24.\n\n\"Now, for some important advice,\" they continued. \"Choose wisely.\"\n\nTrump himself addressed DeSantis' departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.\n\n\"We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race - Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,\" Trump said to cheers, before a \"Trump!\" chant broke out in the room of volunteers.\n\nAsked if he would be using the nickname \"Ron DeSanctimonious\": \"I said that name is officially retired,\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nAt roughly the same time not far away, DeSantis' dejected supporters gathered privately in the Manchester restaurant where he had been scheduled to speak.\n\nRep. James Spillane, of Deerfield, said he had initially backed Trump, switched to DeSantis and will now vote for Trump.\n\n\"I had a suspicion this morning, and I had talked to some friends of mine saying the way I was hearing things shake out, I thought this was going to happen, and I was right,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, DeSantis is not going to be able to make it forward. However, in the future, hopefully we can have a viable way forward in 2028.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro in Washington; Jill Colvin and Michelle L.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis approaches the end of his second term in office, he's talking up one potential heir to succeed him in 2026: his wife, Casey DeSantis . And he's taking a shot at President Donald Trump 's pick to be the next governor.\n\nQuestioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy and argued that the state's first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin.\n\n\"She's somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,\" DeSantis said of his wife. \"Anything we've accomplished, she'd be able to take to the next level.\"\n\nThe comments came days after the president threw his support behind U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds , a Florida Republican who has been a prominent surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and cable news.\n\n\"We've achieved victories in Florida,\" DeSantis said Monday. \"A guy like Byron, he just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left over these last years.\"\n\nDeSantis' comments create a potential faceoff between the Republican governor and the president who soundly defeated him last year for the Republican presidential nomination. DeSantis, who is term-limited, may run for president again in 2028 and has worked to rebuild his relationship with Trump.\n\nThe aspirations of the state's first lady have long been the subject of Tallahassee parlor talk. That chatter has grown louder in recent weeks as tensions have bubbled between the governor and Trump's allies in the Florida Legislature.\n\n\"Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement,\" Trump wrote Thursday on social media. \"RUN, BYRON, RUN!\"\n\nIn a statement shared by a spokesperson on Tuesday, Donalds said \"I am honored to have President Trump's complete and total endorsement.\"\n\nHe addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference last week after Trump's post and told the audience to \"stay tuned\" about his future plans.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz , another staunch Trump ally, criticized DeSantis' comments in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Man it hurts me to see this,\" Gaetz said. \"Governor DeSantis, don't you remember when you, (Donalds) and I were working collaboratively to get you elected in 2018? We literally were your debate prep team.\"\n\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Ron DeSantis the opportunity to elevate an ally to the powerful position ahead of the 2026 governor's race.\n\nAnnouncing the appointment Friday, FIU Board of Trustees Chair Roger Tovar said he was contacted directly by DeSantis' office about tapping Nuñez and later had multiple conversations with her.\n\n\"I can think of no better advocate for FIU than a two-time alumni from South Florida who has the experience of having served in the Florida Legislature and her time as lieutenant governor,\" Tovar said.\n\nIt's the latest shakeup among the state's top officeholders, as Florida Republicans score jobs in President Donald Trump's administration and beyond - and another chance for DeSantis to cement his influence long after his time in the governor's mansion runs out.\n\nWith the appointment to replace Nuñez, DeSantis could give an edge to a chosen successor, at a time when multiple Trump allies are rumored to be eyeing a run for governor.\n\nUnder DeSantis' influence, the boards tasked with hiring presidents for the state's public colleges and universities are increasingly choosing Republican politicians allied with his conservative agenda - a pattern that has alarmed many students and professors .\n\nSelecting DeSantis' second-in-command for a presidential post - which generally comes with a multi-year contract for a six-figure salary and a plush on-campus residence - is just the latest and clearest example of the governor's impact on higher education.\n\nNuñez is slated to take over the interim job leading the public university in her hometown of Miami on Feb. 17 and is expected to win the permanent position, following a formal search process.\n\nWith more than 56,000 students, FIU is one of the country's largest universities, serving a significant population of Hispanic, first-generation and low-income students.\n\nNuñez will succeed President Kenneth Jessell, who has spent his career as a finance professor and university administrator, and who is stepping down early ahead of his contract ending in November.\n\n___\n\nKate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) - Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are charged with human trafficking in Romania, have returned to the U.S. after authorities lifted travel restrictions on the siblings , who have millions of online followers.\n\nAfter the pair arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made it clear the influencer brothers are not welcome in his state and that his administration is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the pair - sparking pushback from supporters of the Tates.\n\nHere is what to know.\n\nAndrew Tate , 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X. He and his brother Tristan Tate, 36, are vocal supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAndrew Tate is a hugely successful social media figure , attracting millions of followers, many of them young men and schoolchildren who were drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle the influencer projects online.\n\nHe previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech and his misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for getting sexually assaulted.\n\nThe Tates, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were arrested in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny the allegations.\n\nThe Tates' departure came after Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said this month that a Trump administration official expressed interest in the brothers' case at the recent Munich Security Conference.\n\nJust weeks ago, Andrew Tate posted on X: \"The Tates will be free, Trump is the president. The good old days are back. And they will be better than ever. Hold on.\"\n\nThe Tates arrived in the U.S. Thursday, landing in Fort Lauderdale around midday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the airport, Andrew Tate repeated his insistence that the siblings had done nothing wrong.\n\n\"We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty. And I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood. There's a lot of opinions about us, things that go around about us on the internet,\" he said.\n\nThe brothers are expected to return to Romania, where they still face criminal charges. An attorney for the siblings there did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday on when they are due back in the country.\n\nThe brothers' return to the U.S. - after a Trump official expressed interest in their case - has sparked disagreement among conservative commentators and officials.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis made clear he doesn't want the brothers to remain in his state.\n\n\"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct,\" DeSantis said.\n\nFlorida's attorney general is examining whether the state may have any jurisdiction over the brothers' alleged crimes, and if so, how to \"hold them accountable.\" In court documents, the Tates have said they are not and have never been Florida residents.\n\nOther Republicans in the Sunshine State - which has become a stronghold of Trump's MAGA movement - are rolling out the welcome mat.\n\nIn a post on X, the Tampa Bay Young Republicans club formally invited Andrew Tate to speak to their group.\n\n\"As free speech absolutists, the Tate's haven't been formally convicted of any crimes and are welcome to speak to our group,\" the post reads. \"We're old enough to remember when a (asterisk)\"Convicted Felon.\"(asterisk) won the Presidency.\"\n\nThe Tates still face criminal charges in Romania and will have to return at least from time to time for proceedings in that case, which is expected to take years to resolve.\n\nOnce the legal saga in Romania ends, the United Kingdom has an extradition request - that was approved last year by a Romanian court - for separate charges the Tates face there related to allegations of sexual aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, a defamation lawsuit the brothers filed in Palm Beach Circuit Court in 2023 continues to proceed. The pair filed the case against a woman who accused them of imprisoning her in Romania. A judge has denied a motion by the woman, identified as Jane Doe, to pause the case until the Romanian matter is concluded.\n\nNow that they are back in the U.S., the Tates have filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order against the woman, but no ruling has been issued as of Friday afternoon. The siblings want the woman barred from coming within 500 feet (152 meters) of them and that she be prevented from \"contacting, threatening, stalking, harming or harassing\" either Tate brother.\n\n___ Associated Press writers Curt Anderson in Tampa and Stephen McGrath in Sighisoara, Romania, contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a news conference Sept. 16, 2024, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - With an open presidential primary coming in 2028, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is launching an offensive to win back supporters of the Republican leader whom he dared to challenge in the last election. And he's doing so by latching onto President Donald Trump's most prominent issue - immigration.\n\nThe problem for DeSantis is his own state's Republicans think they know Trump better.\n\nDeSantis last week ordered lawmakers into a special legislative session to pass a raft of border-related proposals he floated, including criminal charges for officers if they didn't enforce immigration measures and restrictions on people who send money to families outside the U.S.\n\nWithin minutes of the session convening, legislators tossed out the governor's proposals and called their own special session. They ignored many of his requests and presented their own bill that cedes much of DeSantis' power on immigration enforcement to the state's agriculture commissioner. Lawmakers titled it the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP, Act.\n\nThe battle has exposed the term-limited governor's struggles to regain the power he lost in his first White House run as he prepares for a potential second try.\n\nHaving led Florida's transformation from a perennial swing state to one that votes solidly Republican, DeSantis is betting on his feel for his state's voters, who delivered a second term by a huge 19-point margin. But he has struggled to capture the unstoppable aura he had before he went against Trump - and his relative lack of relationships with lawmakers hasn't helped.\n\n▶ Follow today's live updates on the Trump administration\n\n\"This is a relationship business,\" Republican political consultant Jamie Miller said. \"And he is not good at the relationship side.\"\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBack in 2023, when DeSantis braved the frigid Iowa winter to run for president - and brought some loyal legislators to campaign for him - he sold himself to voters as a brash, bold executive, a more effective version of Trump. And he could point to the results, thanks to the Florida legislature.\n\nFor six years, DeSantis kept lawmakers in line with his veto pen. But as DeSantis' chances faded on his way to a blowout loss in the Iowa caucuses , the presidential sheen wore off.\n\nIn a sign DeSantis was not proving a threat to Trump, the Republican Party of Florida voted in September 2023 not to require participants in the state's 2024 presidential primary to pledge to support the eventual nominee, which ensured Trump would not have to pledge support to DeSantis when the two were locked in a bitter campaign.\n\nDeSantis would never gain the national traction his campaign had set out to demonstrate, and would be out of the race within a week of the leadoff Iowa caucuses. Despite a year of Trump's taunts, they reached a public rapprochement last May, when DeSantis agreed to convene his top donors to raise money for Trump.\n\n\"Ron, I love that you're back,\" Trump said during a conference call to the donors as they gathered at a Fort Lauderdale hotel, raising $3 million in a day for Trump's campaign.\n\nBy December, DeSantis had worked his way into the discussion for Trump's defense secretary when Pete Hegseth encountered public resistance. Hegseth was ultimately confirmed.\n\nDeSantis has never been comfortable with the backslapping and favor-trading side of politics, which some of his most influential supporters say may rub some lawmakers the wrong way. Even among his admirers, DeSantis is known for having little patience for greasing the wheels of government - shaking hands and making phone calls. Trump, meanwhile, is well-known for his personal touch, often calling lawmakers for their input and inviting current and would-be allies to his Mar-a-Lago estate or his other properties.\n\nAnd now the governor's attitude is costing him, some capitol watchers say.\n\nLast month, when DeSantis announced he was calling lawmakers into special session, House Speaker Daniel Perez told The Associated Press the legislature was \"blindsided.\"\n\n\"I called him immediately,\" Perez said. \"He didn't answer. He didn't call me back.\"\n\nState Sen. Randy Fine is a former ally of the governor who later endorsed Trump in the 2024 primary. The president returned the favor after his victory by endorsing Fine in a Republican primary for the U.S. House seat previously held by Mike Waltz, who was picked to be national security adviser. Last week, Fine won the contest with more than 80% of the vote and is on track to win the seat in April, despite not living in the district he hopes to represent.\n\nFine compared his reward to the treatment of lawmakers who were loyal to DeSantis - and are now being attacked as \"Republicans in name only.\"\n\n\"I was loyal. I'm going to Congress. They were loyal. They get called RINOs who want amnesty,\" Fine said. \"There are female members of the Legislature who went to Iowa a year ago and walked through the snow to help him and got frostbite. And now a year later they're RINOs who want amnesty? I think it's hard to describe the sense of betrayal.\"\n\nBoth sides of the argument over Florida's immigration battle say they are best capturing Trump's desires.\n\nThe governor said the legislature's measure is a \"betrayal\" of conservative voters and naming it after the president is a \"misnomer.\"\n\n\"President Trump has been very strong coming out of the gate on immigration enforcement. He wants to solve this problem once and for all. The bill they did is more window dressing,\" DeSantis said in a video he posted on X. Transferring his power to the agriculture commissioner, he said, would be like putting the \"fox in charge of the hen house,\" implying farmers want to continue to hire immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nBut legislators say they have Trump's blessing. The bill sponsor, the Florida House speaker and the state senator expected to be sent to Congress visited the White House on Monday to celebrate NHL's defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers .\n\n\"The whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\" said Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, a bill sponsor and Trump ally. He said Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president and immigration hard-liner, gave lawmakers \"technical guidance\" and they made changes to the bill \"to make sure we're doing everything that the president's team wants.\"\n\nDeSantis has picked up some support along the way. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a key Trump ally who might run to replace the term-limited DeSantis next year, said his own relationship with the governor \"got frayed\" when Donalds backed Trump two years ago. But last week, Donalds said in a podcast the governor was \"correct\" that he needed to have enforcement powers over immigration.\n\nKevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, chimed in on social media to highlight DeSantis' proposals. The think tank Roberts leads drafted Project 2025 , the blueprint for a hard-right turn in American government and society that has inspired a number of Trump actions.\n\n\"Now is not the time for watered-down proposals,\" Roberts posted on X, giving DeSantis a \"bravo.\"\n\nNeither the president nor the White House has publicly expressed an opinion. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nFor now, DeSantis appears to be winning the war on social media and conservative airwaves, said Miller, the political consultant.\n\n\"But we all know that that microphone can be taken away with one tweet,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Ron DeSantis speaks at a press conference at Florida International University's Wall of Wind, Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025, in Miami. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis on Monday named his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier as Florida's attorney general, handing the state's top law enforcement role to a trusted aide who has helped orchestrate and defend some of his most divisive initiatives .\n\nUthmeier was sworn in Monday during a ceremony in Tallahassee. The 37-year-old becomes one of the youngest state attorneys general and the latest person to benefit from the political shuffle sparked by President Donald Trump 's drafting of Sunshine State Republicans for his new administration. Uthmeier is poised to spearhead Florida's legal battles to bolster Trump's sweeping conservative agenda, at a time when the state's leaders are eager to pass new laws and challenge legal precedent to demonstrate their allegiance to the president.\n\nUthmeier succeeds former Attorney General Ashley Moody , whom the governor tapped to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Marco Rubio , Trump's pick to be U.S. secretary of state.\n\nDeSantis said Uthmeier was a \"bulldog in our administration\" who will not shy away from a difficult fight. The Republican governor praised Uthmeier's work in his administration, including fighting federal mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic and combating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in higher education.\n\n\"All throughout our administration, James was always digging in and fighting for what was right even when it wasn't easy,\" DeSantis said during the ceremony.\n\nUthmeier in his remarks promised to \"endeavor every day to do what is right and to levy justice where it is due.\"\n\n\"We will champion an America-first agenda, and we will fight back against the cartels, the gangs, and the traffickers that have wreaked havoc on our country for far too long,\" Uthmeier said. \"We will not stand idly by as the left tries to infiltrate our institutions and use the court system to indoctrinate our kids. We will fight the activists that try to weaken our duly enacted laws that try to challenge our constitutional order and that try to harm the unborn.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Yale Federalist Society earlier this month, DeSantis suggested Uthmeier could pursue state charges against Dr. Anthony Fauci. Before leaving office, President Joe Biden pardoned Fauci - the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - to guard against potential \"revenge\" by the new Trump administration for his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe started at the governor's office as deputy general counsel in 2019 and was promoted to general counsel the following year.\n\nIn 2021, Uthmeier became chief of staff, but took a leave of absence in 2023 to manage DeSantis' unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. DeSantis bowed out after losing to Trump in the Iowa caucuses by 30 percentage points and Uthmeier returned to his chief of staff role.\n\nUthmeier grew up in the beach resort town of Destin, Florida, and attended the University of Florida, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and political science, and a master's degree in international business.\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Law School in 2014, he spent years in Washington, where he interned as a law clerk in Rubio's office. He worked as an associate at Jones Day, a major law firm, before joining the Trump administration in 2017, where he served as a senior adviser to then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nFor the past six years, Uthmeier has helped orchestrate and defend some of the governor's most controversial and legally questionable initiatives, including a state-funded effort to fly about 50 migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Uthmeier also chaired two political committees - Keep Florida Clean and the Florida Freedom Fund - that raised more than $1 million to oppose measures on the 2024 ballot that would have expanded abortion rights and legalized recreational marijuana .\n\nA majority of Florida voters backed the proposals, but the initiatives failed to clear the 60% threshold needed to pass after DeSantis' office used state money and his considerable influence to oppose them.\n\nThe state's Attorney General's Office has a record of defending the conservative agendas of DeSantis and Trump. Moody spent months arguing to keep the abortion rights and recreational marijuana proposals off the 2024 ballot in Florida and was one of the Republican attorneys generals who joined a lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to overturn Biden's election victory in the 2020.\n\n___\n\nPayne reported from Tallahassee, Florida.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis: You Have to Meet Me to Like Me\n\nMedia Reporter\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has seen woe after woe in his campaign for the Republican nomination, forcing him to cut staff and actually engage with traditional media outlets.\n\nBut the governor seemingly donned a pair of rose-colored lenses in an interview on Fox News' MediaBuzz on Sunday, downplaying problems and pointing to his trips to early primary states. It's there, he told host Howard Kurtz, where he's found his voting audience-once they meet him in person.\n\n\"We were just in Iowa on Friday at the Family Leaders Summit. That was effectively the kickoff to Iowa caucus season,\" DeSantis said. \"So Iowans are starting to pay more attention to it. We were able to talk to thousands of people over a two-day period, and the number one thing I hear from people is this. They're like, 'Yeah, you know, I knew you did good things in Florida, but I hadn't seen you yet, and now that I've seen you, I'm for you.'\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeSantis' claim comes despite an avalanche of media reports about his personal awkwardness and questions about whether he has the charisma to succeed on the trail.\n\nDeSantis framed the barrage of negative press stories as the workings of a \"corporate press\" that does not want to see him \"dismantle the administrative state.\" He insisted the Republican debates would be another vector for highlighting his personality to voters.\n\n\"There's a lot of Republican voters out there, they like what we've done in Florida. They know I'm a good governor,\" DeSantis said. \"But they haven't seen a lot about me up close and personal, so that gives us a great opportunity to be able to share our vision.\"\n\nEven with six months before a single vote is cast in the race, DeSantis' time to make that case to voters is short.\n\nThe candidate has largely limited sit-down interviews to conservative media outlets, such as Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network. His finances have been strapped, and he burned through nearly $8 million in the first six weeks of his candidacy, according to an NBC News analysis . DeSantis raised $20 million in the second quarter, millions ahead of Donald Trump, but $14 million of that was from donors who maxed out their donations and $3 million must be set aside for a general election campaign.\n\nThere have been signs of a strategy shift. DeSantis fired about 10 event planning staffers on Thursday, according to Politico , though he still boasts the largest campaign staff in the Republican field. CNN also announced that Jake Tapper would interview DeSantis on Tuesday, the governor's first extended interview on the network since 2017.\n\nDeSantis refused to address these issues head-on during his MediaBuzz interview, instead noting just how well he does-once voters meet him.\n\n\"The more I'm out there, the more support we get in these early states, and it is a state-by-state primary,\" he said. \"So I think it would be political malpractice to be running for president fixated on national rather than Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. So that's what we've done. You can make up ground, and we are making up ground in all those states. That is not really going to be reflected in the national poll because they're such small states that you're not going to end up doing that.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Never Caught Fire. Now It's Catching Up to Him.\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nMANCHESTER, New Hampshire- Less than two months before Republican voters begin casting their primary ballots, it's clear Ron DeSantis ' presidential campaign is broken-and he's not fixing it either.\n\nDuring a campaign stop at a stodgy New Hampshire banquet hall last week, DeSantis continued to display the range of tics and verbal crutches that have defined his campaign as an exercise in cringe.\n\nDespite pleas from his supporters and outside observers to stop mentioning his home state so frequently , for instance, the governor of Florida mentioned Florida some 40 times in just under an hour of speaking time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe repeated the same anecdote he usually relays to New Hampshire crowds about how his two daughters didn't want to come on his last trip up north, which he took as a prime opportunity to take his 5-year old son, Mason, to see Fenway Park in Boston. The Florida governor also insisted he supported the Boston Red Sox \"for all seven years\" of his time at Harvard and Yale.\n\nAnd just like he has during his entire campaign, DeSantis could only attempt indirect, glancing blows at the person he needs to beat to win the GOP presidential nomination- Donald Trump .\n\n\"You can go out there half-cocked and shoot your mouth and do all this,\" DeSantis said, ostensibly referring to Trump, \"but if you're not actually delivering and winning elections... we have a record of doing that in Florida.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, usually an easily excitable presence, did not sound especially enthused to be introducing his Florida counterpart at the event.\n\nIn rushed remarks , Sununu claimed DeSantis is \"making a huge surge\" and \"putting the foot leather down, if you will.\" (If the polls are any indication, DeSantis may need more foot leather: He's sunk into the single digits in New Hampshire, trading places with former unknown Vivek Ramaswamy .)\n\nPerhaps fittingly, a campaign stop that encapsulated DeSantis' fundamental flaws as a candidate kicked off a week that encapsulated the fundamental flaws of his campaign operation and strategy.\n\nDuring DeSantis' New Hampshire swing, NBC News reported that the governor's official campaign and its most essential ally-the Never Back Down super PAC-have been beset with bitter infighting. The warfare got so bad that a new super PAC with different leaders is being spun off, reportedly with DeSantis' blessing.\n\nThat PAC, according to Republicans familiar with the move, is more closely aligned with DeSantis campaign manager James Uthmeier, who came in to replace the governor's first campaign manager in August.\n\nOn top of that, Never Back Down-the source of most of DeSantis' TV ads, and the highest spender among any other campaign or PAC this cycle-has gone dark on the airwaves in New Hampshire and is not expected to air any until the first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23. If DeSantis performs above expectations in the Jan. 15 Iowa caucus, his cash-strapped campaign would have to bankroll New Hampshire ads, according to Republicans briefed on the DeSantis team's plans.\n\nWhile DeSantis' struggles are hardly new, the most urgent problem for the Florida governor is the lack of progress he's made in addressing them as the primary campaign hurtles into its home stretch with former President Donald Trump still very much in command.\n\nStill, DeSantis' team sees their path to victory running through Iowa, where they would look to capitalize on the momentum of a strong caucus showing and turn their steady descent toward irrelevance into a winning streak that would, finally, put Trump on his heels.\n\nIncreasingly, however, it seems that if any candidate is to play that role, it will be Nikki Haley , who is beginning to consolidate the non-Trump primary vote and, crucially, donor support. On Tuesday, Haley secured the endorsement of the billionaire Koch brothers' political network-unlocking a vast pool of financial and organizing resources to power her through the most critical phase of the primary.\n\nNow, the Florida governor is increasingly confronting an idea he often references on the trail: \"managed decline.\" But in this context, it's DeSantis' political future, not U.S. superpower status, requiring the management.\n\n\"It feels like there was a little bit of a reboot there late in summer,\" Jim Merrill, a longtime GOP presidential campaign strategist based in New Hampshire told The Daily Beast, \"but it ended up being more of the same.\"\n\nIn response to The Daily Beast, the DeSantis campaign pointed out they've gone up with TV ads earlier than initially planned in Iowa , and included a response from campaign spokesperson Andrew Romeo following the news Haley won the endorsement of the Koch network.\n\n\"Congratulations to Donald Trump on securing the Koch endorsement,\" Romeo tweeted shortly after the news broke. \"Like clockwork, the pro-open borders, pro-jail break bill establishment is lining up behind a moderate who has no mathematical pathway of defeating the former president. Every dollar spent on Nikki Haley's candidacy should be reported as an in-kind to the Trump campaign.\"\n\nNever Back Down PAC did not return a request for comment.\n\nFor the duration of the primary, DeSantis' message has long been some version of \"Trump-light,\" as University of New Hampshire pollster Andrew Smith put it, \"but the Trump supporters basically just said, why should we get Trump-light when we can have full-strength Trump?\"\n\nMost amused by that state of affairs is, unsurprisingly, Trumpworld. After the former president spent the early months of his campaign pummeling DeSantis with attacks, he and his team have largely lost interest in attacking him since the late summer.\n\n\"I find no amusement in it anymore. It's sad, I honestly feel kinda bad for some of these folks,\" a source close to the Trump campaign told The Daily Beast. \"What will be really entertaining is when [after the 2024 election] all of the Never Back Down people and DeSantis will have to sit at Harvard talking about where everything went wrong. This is gonna be even more entertaining, and there might be fists thrown.\"\n\nThe balkanized culture of the DeSantis operation-siloed among the campaign and supporting PACs-has also been a consistent drag on his candidacy, Republicans say.\n\n\"The biggest thing I've heard is, it's a bad culture, there's no information flow,\" a GOP consultant told The Daily Beast, requesting anonymity to recount conversations with ex-DeSantis staffers. \"There are senior-level people over there who just don't don't know what's going on.\"\n\nAn early DeSantis supporter and presidential campaign veteran in New Hampshire let out a sigh when asked about the campaign culture, which they described as marked by constant squabbles over minor details.\n\n\"The DeSantis team?\" they asked. \"Everything's a fucking problem.\"\n\nIn a more encouraging sign for DeSantis, Republicans who interact with him are coming away with positive impressions-just behind closed doors.\n\nOne locally influential and undecided Republican said the candidate they saw at a private event was a far cry from the brand label version of DeSantis sold by the PAC and the campaign.\n\n\"I think he's better with a smaller number of people,\" the longtime New Hampshire primary operator said, evoking a description of DeSantis eerily reminiscent of the one pushed by allies of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: If only you could see the candidate behind closed doors.\n\nWhile DeSantis usually makes a passing reference to the importance of having a two-term GOP president in private, the event attendee said the Florida governor detailed a more technocratic vision for how he would govern, looking at both short and long-term impacts.\n\n\"He seemed like a new person, to me,\" the Republican said, adding they were impressed with how DeSantis handled pressure on a question over abortion in private.\n\nWith just weeks left for DeSantis to change the dynamic of his campaign, the governor and his team are trying something new-and risky. On Thursday, he is scheduled to debate California Gov. Gavin Newsom on primetime television.\n\nWhile DeSantis hasn't gotten the opportunity to debate Trump, there's hope that a one-on-one match against his California counterpart and archenemy might show a side of him that has so far gone unnoticed.\n\nAt his Manchester event last week, DeSantis put up a confident front when asked about the debate, accusing the California governor of running \"a shadow campaign\" for 2024 in the event President Joe Biden doesn't end up on the ballot.\n\nBut privately, early DeSantis backers in New Hampshire are more than a little worried about the downside of debating Newsom.\n\n\"If Ron DeSantis doesn't find a personality and a way to find a way to articulate thoughts that are not canned answers,\" a New Hampshire primary veteran and DeSantis supporter told The Daily Beast, \"he could get his ass kicked, and it'll hurt him. If you're gonna go after Newsom, you better not miss.\"\n\nAs much as the Newsom debate offers DeSantis an unconventional chance to shake things up, there's a limit to how much a one-off event can shift his image among GOP voters.\n\n\"You don't often get a second chance to make a first impression,\" Merrill said.\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

Ron DeSantis on his restrictive six-week ban.\n\nTrump spoke to Kristen Welker for her debut as moderator of Meet the Press, where she asked him if he would sign a 15-week abortion ban if it came to his desk. The former president has previously been noncommittal on the issue, a trend that was apparent yet again during the exchange, though he maintained he didn't believe abortions should be allowed later into a pregnancy-and falsely claimed that Democrats want to be able \"kill the baby after birth.\"\n\n\"I would sit down with both sides and I'd negotiate something, and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years. I'm not going to say I would or I wouldn't,\" Trump said. \"I mean, 'DeSanctus' is willing to sign a five-week and six-week ban.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWelker pressed Trump on his opinion on the Florida governor's policy, which was signed in April. It gave Trump the opening to hit his presidential primary opponent for being overly limiting.\n\n\"I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake,\" Trump said. \"But we'll come up with a number, but at the same time, Democrats won't be able to go out at six months, seven months, eight months and allow an abortion.\"\n\nAbortions at the latest stages of a pregnancy are incredibly rare. The most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in 2020, showed that less than 1 percent of abortions occurred at 21 weeks or later.\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "A Ron DeSantis Presidency Would Be All Authoritarian Culture War Nonsense\n\nI do not consider myself a big Ronald Reagan fan, but I'm willing to give credit where credit is due.\n\nPresident Reagan was a policy guy. (That I disagree with the wisdom and effectiveness of many of his policies is beside the point.) He had big ideas on how to fight communism and grow the economy. He was a traditional conservative: shrink the government and keep it out of Americans' lives. He understood that politics is the art of compromise. He worked across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation on taxes, immigration, and social security.\n\nAnd while it is often left out of Reagan lore , he even raised taxes in later years after his massive 1981 tax cuts led to mounting deficits-an example of Reagan being practical even though it contradicted his tax-cutting image. As a former actor (and perhaps as a former Democrat), Reagan had to work hard to show voters he was a serious public policy thinker and not just a theatrical performer.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTimes have changed. Enter Ron DeSantis: the Florida governor and presidential contender who has reduced governance to performance art.\n\nHe's the newest star of the Republican silver screen, and his recent, fictional portrayal of an actual statesman is worth critiquing at a time when our politics have blurred the line between showmanship and substance. DeSantis has mastered the Art of the Trump. He represents the newest model of the reality TV politician-full of political stunts but devoid of serious policy.\n\nDeSantis has risen to national prominence as governor of what he calls the \"free state of Florida.\" But that freedom is a mirage, and it conceals the failures lurking beneath the surface while the rights of Floridians are taken away.\n\nFor starters, DeSantis' national profile grew tremendously during the COVID pandemic, but in fact he cast himself in two different roles in that production: he initially closed down businesses and schools, and he established highway and airport checkpoints to monitor travelers entering Florida. Later, he went to the opposite extreme: lifting those same restrictions and interfering with municipalities as they addressed the pandemic.\n\nChanging one's approach to COVID based on the emerging data is certainly defensible, but DeSantis' policy was mostly political gamesmanship and inflammatory rhetoric, from convening a statewide grand jury to \"investigate\" vaccines, to hiring as surgeon general a controversial doctor who has spread debunked medical theories about vaccines. DeSantis even called for Dr. Anthony Fauci to be thrown into the Potomac .\n\nAs part of his act, DeSantis boasts about Florida's economic success and the state's budget surplus but ignores the inconvenient truth that federal stimulus dollars-which he criticizes-helped fund it.\n\nHis supporters portray him as a fighter-someone who doesn't back down from a tough challenge. But in reality, DeSantis is afraid of tough questions , rarely granting interviews to most media outlets other than far-right journalists who lob softballs, and he often refuses to answer reporters at all during press conferences.\n\nDeSantis' favorite theatrical routine is fanning the flames of the culture war: passing a six-week abortion ban, anti-\"woke\" legislation (whatever that means), and the so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law; attacking Disney, the Special Olympics, and social media companies; suspending a twice-elected prosecutor; and transporting Texas migrants to Massachusetts while claiming with a straight face that it was somehow done to protect Floridians.\n\nMany of the controversial laws he has championed have been held unconstitutional; others are still being challenged in court. A federal judge threw out his \"Stop WOKE Act,\" calling it \" positively dystopian .\"\n\nAnother federal judge found he violated both state and federal law in suspending me from my elected position as Tampa's local prosecutor for political reasons and publicity.\n\nNone of that appears to matter to DeSantis, who rattles off these so-called accomplishments during stump speeches, in spite of the fact that they have been found to violate the fundamental freedoms of the citizens whose rights he has sworn to uphold.\n\nDeSantis' willingness to violate people's constitutional rights to grab a headline (or a primetime interview on Fox News) is scary, but the real danger is that he has reduced serious political discourse to the public policy equivalent of the class clown.\n\nDeSantis is a Harvard and Yale graduate-a guy smart enough to know better, but acting the fool. Governance involves complex issues of public policy. It requires identifying problems, developing and implementing solutions, making difficult choices, explaining those choices to your constituents, and being truthful about your successes as well as your failures. DeSantis has built his political career by largely doing the opposite.\n\nAs a member of Congress for six years-during a period when his Republican Party held a majority in the House-the only legislation that DeSantis authored which became law was a one-sentence amendment to a 2018 appropriation bill that prohibited the Defense Department from buying heavy water from Iran. That may have been a sensible tweak, but it is not exactly \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" in its ambition.\n\nAs governor, his legislative victories are mostly culture war issues that have energized his base, but have had minimal impact on the kitchen table issues that concern most Floridians, as well as most Americans.\n\nThe microscope of a presidential campaign will pull back the curtain on who DeSantis is and what he has (and has not) done. I am not sure that the specter of a DeSantis presidency has President Reagan turning over in his grave, but the Gipper would certainly agree that these are serious times for serious leaders-not for pretenders just playing them on TV.\n\nAndrew Warren was elected State Attorney of Hillsborough County, Florida in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. In August 2022, Warren was unlawfully suspended by Gov. Ron DeSantis for speaking out against laws criminalizing abortion and discriminating against transgender Americans-a federal court found that the suspension violated the U.S. and Florida Constitutions but said it lacked the jurisdiction to reinstate him. Warren's legal fight against DeSantis is ongoing.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

He doesn't like prolonged eye contact.\n\nThese are but a few of the tips-offered by a longtime Democratic operative-for the seven Republican presidential hopefuls who will find themselves on a debate stage Wednesday night with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFor two elections in a row, Joshua Karp steeped himself in DeSantis debate prep as an adviser to Andrew Gillum and Charlie Crist, the Democrats who ran and lost against DeSantis in 2018 and 2022, respectively.\n\nMore than perhaps any Republican on the debate stage in Milwaukee, Karp has an intimate knowledge of DeSantis' strengths and weaknesses as a debater.\n\nThe Democratic operative told The Daily Beast he's spent countless hours \"watching film\" on DeSantis, as if he were a college football scout fixated on a blue chip recruit.\n\nBut what surprised Karp the most after extensively preparing two very different Democratic candidates for debates against DeSantis was the lack of polish from the Republican, who otherwise came across smoothly on TV in the right setting.\n\n\"Basically from the jump, it was clear he hadn't prepared at all,\" Karp said.\n\nIt seems unlikely the same will be the case for DeSantis ahead of the first GOP presidential debate, which is crucial for his 2024 aspirations. The event is the Florida governor's best chance yet to kickstart his stalling campaign , currently on its third reboot in not quite as many months.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's decision to skip the debate also gives DeSantis-who will be standing in center stage-the opportunity to manifest a vision of the GOP he is trying to forge into reality, said Karp.\n\n\"A win for DeSantis is coming out of the debate looking like the frontrunner on a stage that doesn't have Donald Trump,\" Karp said. \"Like, give the Republican Party a picture of a party that doesn't have Donald Trump in it.\"\n\nBut the governor's 2024 bid has been dogged by scrutiny and punditry spotlighting his awkwardness on the campaign trail and his apparent discomfort in unscripted interviews and interactions.\n\nFor the other GOP presidential hopefuls on stage, DeSantis-and his diminished yet still substantial share of the primary electorate-is ripe for the taking. Even the governor's allies have admitted he will likely bear the brunt of the attacks flying across the stage on Wednesday night.\n\nFor candidates willing to go the extra mile and set a trap for DeSantis based on his past behavior, the spoils of a campaign-defining moment at the expense of the field's clear number two could be all theirs.\n\n\"Ron DeSantis has never learned how to take a punch,\" Karp said. \"He can't counterpunch with more force. The big test of this debate is whether he is able to control those bad instincts that he's got.\"\n\nThe DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nKarp had a front row seat to the early DeSantis debate moments his GOP rivals may be closely reviewing now. Yes, his candidates ultimately lost to DeSantis both times, Gillum by just 0.4 percent of the vote in 2018, and Crist by more than 19 points in a 2022 blowout.\n\nBut Karp remains adamant those signs of DeSantis' future struggles were obvious all along in his gubernatorial debates.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring example was DeSantis' deer-in-the-headlights moment against Crist in 2022. In their only debate, the governor was caught completely off guard by his Democratic opponent, whom Karp described as \"not naturally a good or poor debater, but a hard worker.\"\n\nHaving watched his film, Crist knew where and how to strike: at DeSantis' obvious presidential ambitions.\n\n\"Why don't you look in the eyes of the people of the state of Florida and say to them, if you're re-elected, you will serve a full four-year term as governor?\" Crist asked, while keeping his gaze focused on DeSantis, who stayed frozen. \"Yes or no?\"\n\nStaring ahead intently, DeSantis remained silent for a very long 10 seconds. His eyes began to twitch before he glanced at the moderator and referenced the rule that he did not have to answer questions from his opponent.\n\nWhen the awkwardness subsided, DeSantis eventually got back to his more polished attack line on Crist, which neatly doubled as a jab at President Joe Biden. \"The only worn-out old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture,\" he said, \"is Charlie Crist.\"\n\nThe semi-viral moment marked perhaps the high point of any optimism behind Crist, a former Republican governor who always faced long odds to topple DeSantis.\n\nBut things were different in 2018, when DeSantis was a relatively unknown quantity who was locked in a toss-up race against Gillum, then the popular mayor of Tallahassee. (He has since been indicted on corruption charges; they were dropped in May after a mistrial.)\n\nThen, Karp looked at DeSantis' resume as a Navy JAG officer with a pair of Ivy League degrees-not to mention his competitive streak, which eventually led him to four varsity letters at Yale-as indicators he would put up a strong fight.\n\nInstead, they got the DeSantis the rest of the GOP has become more acquainted with since launching his 2024 campaign in late May .\n\nKarp predicted DeSantis would come at Gillum hard on culture war issues such as defunding the police, a contentious issue at the time. But DeSantis kept picking fights with the moderators and appeared not to know the rules of the debate format.\n\n\"What we didn't predict was how whiny, argumentative, and ineffective he would be at that,\" he said.\n\nThen DeSantis laid a trap for himself and gave Gillum his viral moment.\n\nAfter cutting off the moderator's question about appearing at four events hosted by a white supremacist who used racial slurs to refer to former President Barack Obama and called him a \"Muslim,\" DeSantis' voice cracked as he avoided condemning the rhetoric. \"How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement somebody makes?\" he asked.\n\nGillum had a knockout blow ready to go.\n\n\"My grandmother used to say a hit dog will holler,\" Gillum said. \"And it hollered through this room... Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\n\"Everyone credits Andrew Gillum with amazing delivery of those lines,\" Karp said. \"Andrew Gillum is an amazing debater, but it's DeSantis who set himself up for that.\"\n\nIn the GOP primary, for a skilled debater like former Gov. Chris Christie, DeSantis may prove to be an ideal target the second he gets flustered, Karp said.\n\n\"I think the biggest threat to Ron DeSantis on the debate stage is Ron DeSantis, but right over his shoulder is Chris Christie,\" he argued.\n\nChristie comes into the debate with some of the hottest anticipation around his performance, leaving a high bar after exiting the 2016 race with an evisceration of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who inadvertently kept repeating a line about Obama.\n\nThen there's the brewing feud between DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who, as The Daily Beast reported last week, has decided to mostly skip conventional debate prep, save for a few foreign policy briefings and a three-hour topless tennis session .\n\nRamaswamy has slowly climbed in the polls and is close to surpassing DeSantis nationally. The pro-DeSantis PAC Never Back Down took notice: In a lengthy debate memo reported by The New York Times , the PAC telegraphed to DeSantis a strategy of taking \"a sledgehammer\" to Ramaswamy.\n\nFor the non-Christie candidates, Karp said the best way to get under DeSantis' skin is to keep it simple.\n\n\"It depends on the chemistry in the room, but one of the things that Charlie did that was particularly effective was he made eye contact with the camera and the viewers back home, and when Desantis was attacking him, he looked at DeSantis,\" the Democrat said.\n\nStill, there's a silver lining for DeSantis, even in the eyes of a hardened opponent who's watched him like a hawk.\n\n\"The bar for Ron DeSantis is in the basement right now. Everyone knows this is not a format in which he excels,\" Karp said. \"So it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of commentators view him as doing well in the debate just because expectations are so low.\"\n\nBut the brutal 2024 GOP presidential primary is hardly a breezy 2022 Florida re-election campaign, where a bad viral moment was a mere speed bump for DeSantis on the way to a landslide victory. With the world watching the stage in Milwaukee, even a minor misstep could cement the governor's reputation.\n\n\"What his opponents need to do is trigger the same responses that Andrew Gillum and Charlie Crist were able to,\" Karp said. \"The whiny, off-putting, bratty demeanor that comes off whenever he's challenged.\"\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The GOP Campaign Trail Is Already Getting DeSantis-Proofed\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nAt any given fundraiser or VIP room where he's present, Ron DeSantis is usually easy to find-in the corner, keeping to himself.\n\nDespite having a job that entails exchanging small talk and pleasantries on a daily basis, the Florida governor tends to brush off those obligations and struggles with basic social skills, according to a source close to DeSantis, several of his former staffers, and other GOP operatives who have worked with him and his team.\n\nAs DeSantis gears up for a potential White House run in 2024, his aloof public persona is being thought of by his rivals- namely, former President Donald Trump -as his Achilles heel in the retail politics-heavy early primary states.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd even though he hasn't announced a bid yet, DeSantis' apparent desire to test the waters of a presidential campaign-while barely dipping a toe into the aspects he recoils from-is already being put to the test.\n\nDuring his donor retreat in Palm Beach in late February, an attendee stood up and called him \"DeSatan,\" according to Republicans familiar with the outburst.\n\nAt his recent book tour stop in Davenport, Iowa, a volunteer English teacher and seasoned caucus enthusiast posed for a photo alongside the governor with the term \"fascist\" carved out within her design of a paper snowflake.\n\nThe governor's aversion to pressing the flesh, and his concern over the risk of unexpected interactions with the public, is already so well-known that early primary state players are working to DeSantis-proof their events in order to attract the flinty would-be candidate and his tight-knit team.\n\nThe problem is, hosts often have no idea what the DeSantis team wants.\n\n\"Easily the least responsive campaign I've ever dealt with,\" one veteran event host in an early primary state told The Daily Beast, requesting anonymity to avoid alienating the Florida governor.\n\n\"We invite, invite, invite, ping, ping, ping. We don't hear anything,\" this prominent event host said.\n\n\"He's been tighter in his requests than other candidates,\" a top New Hampshire Republican told The Daily Beast, adding that only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich came to mind as a bigger \"nightmare\" to deal with.\n\nDuring his Iowa swing, DeSantis' apparent use of bike racks to create space between himself and a crowd didn't go unnoticed elsewhere. \"If they want 50 bike racks, we'll give them 50 bike racks,\" a New Hampshire GOP lawmaker quipped to The Daily Beast. A representative for DeSantis did not return a request for comment for this story.\n\nWhile DeSantis is winning over supporters in the conservative movement for his hard-right brand of politics-and has impressed with his electoral success in once-purple Florida-his untested skills under the bright lights of a presidential campaign have led operatives and pundits to wonder if he is just the second coming of Jeb Bush or Scott Walker.\n\nMonths into his own campaign, meanwhile, Trump has started to dabble in retail politics -mostly in the form of unannounced visits to local eateries likely to have a friendly crowd scouted in advance by the campaign, according to the Washington Post -in an effort to paint DeSantis as stiff and cold.\n\nIf DeSantis continues on his current course, Trump's job may not prove very difficult.\n\nGone are the days of covert fundraisers, such as a little known DeSantis soiree in San Francisco last October, which was hosted by David Sacks , an Elon Musk and Peter Thiel acolyte who recently helped spread panic amid the run on Silicon Valley Bank .\n\nIn the critical early primary states of New Hampshire and Iowa, a panoply of elected and unelected power brokers-not to mention thousands of seasoned voters-are accustomed to interacting with presidential candidates up close.\n\nIn their view, that scrutiny helps the rest of the country determine which candidates are legit and which aren't, though many political observers in both parties believe that the early primary's emphasis on retail politics is overblown.\n\nBut the veteran primary event host compared DeSantis' insular approach to the way former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ran her campaign in 2016-not exactly a blueprint that the governor would like to follow.\n\nA GOP strategist, who has no horse in the 2024 race, even compared DeSantis' early approach to that of his potential general election opponent, arguing the governor has embraced a \"Tallahassee basement strategy, mirroring that of Biden in 2020, where he hides from press and real voters.\"\n\nDeSantis' tendency to restrict media outlets also worries hosts of primary campaign stops who have long been friendly to presidential hopefuls of both parties, leading to concerns that the Florida governor may be setting new precedents for future candidates.\n\nThree former DeSantis staffers described him as simply \"quiet\" no matter the occasion-someone who keeps to himself. That's made the shift to the national scene harder than anticipated, one source explained, particularly in the governor's hesitation when it comes to \"delegating\" and his insistence on maintaining a \"very small\" orbit.\n\nFor all the focus on his personality, DeSantis has defenders who don't try to spin it. Former Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL), still an influential donor in the state, told Politico that \"Ron is a little reserved and dry compared to George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is what he is. So what he needs to do is organize his campaign to minimize that characteristic.\"\n\nOr, as comedian Bill Maher put it in a sitdown with CNN in making the devil's advocate case for DeSantis, a good personality isn't \"a prerequisite, it's great if you have one.\"\n\nSeveral former staffers for the governor told The Daily Beast almost everything he does is scripted, which, coupled with an aversion to small talk, general pleasantries, and any unplanned interactions with the public, make him difficult to manage ahead of events.\n\n\"It's very prescribed,\" one former DeSantis staffer told The Daily Beast, while adding there are limited \"off-the-cuff\" interactions while on the trail with DeSantis.\n\nFor his upcoming trip to the Granite State on April 14, DeSantis is expected to keep a minimal media presence at the state GOP's annual Amos Tuck Dinner in Manchester, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nDeSantis may hold a separate press conference or another kind of media availability, but will not take any questions following his remarks at the fundraiser, the source added. Some New Hampshire Republicans have begun to worry that DeSantis' efforts at avoiding any pointed questions from the press or public could become its own sideshow.\n\nThe chatter over DeSantis' public engagement has also surfaced past unflattering stories about his social skills-particularly, his propensity to devour food during meetings.\n\n\"He would sit in meetings and eat in front of people,\" a former DeSantis staffer told The Daily Beast, \"always like a starving animal who has never eaten before... getting shit everywhere.\"\n\nEnshrined in DeSantis lore is an episode from four years ago: During a private plane trip from Tallahassee to Washington, D.C., in March of 2019, DeSantis enjoyed a chocolate pudding dessert-by eating it with three of his fingers, according to two sources familiar with the incident.\n\nA representative for DeSantis' political team did not return a request for comment on it.\n\nThe scrutiny of his social skills, his past interactions, and his openness to unscripted interactions has been inevitable, a seasoned primary operative pointed out.\n\n\"He's obviously gotta be ready to take what comes at this point,\" the senior New Hampshire Republican said, \"because that's how it always is.\"\n\nStill, if he does run, DeSantis would instantly become the most credible potential Republican presidential contender after Trump himself-a status that would afford him real deference on the campaign trail, even if his demands get even more cumbersome.\n\nOne manager of a restaurant that's been a frequent campaign stop in an early primary state told The Daily Beast that they would agree to any DeSantis demands to restrict access.\n\n\"If they came here, they would get the private dining room and it would be their rules and do what you like,\" they said. \"We're not like the diner where you shake hands and make your way through.\"\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Tries to Reboot His Campaign After Botched Launch\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWelcome to Trail Mix, a fun but nutritious snack for your election news diet. See something interesting on the trail? Email me at jake.lahut@thedailybeast.com.\n\nThis week, we look at Ron DeSantis' first seven days officially in the race and preview a pair of long awaited 2024 campaign entrants.\n\n'Are you blind?'\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter suffering the self-inflicted wounds of a chaotically glitchy Twitter campaign launch , Ron DeSantis finally hit the trail as an official presidential candidate this week.\n\nTo get back on track, the Florida governor needed a big rebound, one to silence the doubters who questioned his team's readiness for prime time and to sway Republicans who'd been turned off by his botched start.\n\nWhile there have been bright spots for DeSantis-like an impressive post-launch fundraising haul-his maiden campaign voyage didn't exactly shake up the narrative that the 2024 primary is Donald Trump's to lose.\n\nIn his travels around Iowa and New Hampshire, DeSantis' biggest viral moment came when he snapped at a reporter who questioned him over not taking voter questions. He gently turned up the volume on his Trump rhetoric, but some voters are already growing weary of his attacks, with one telling CBS News he's \" not a huge fan of the shade .\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the social media battle lines where DeSantis' very online campaign lives, a top aide to the governor, Christina Pushaw, may have blown the cover of influential conservatives who attended a DeSantis retreat-all in hopes of dunking on an alleged leaker. Before that, Pushaw had drawn attention for arguing with a 16-year old Trump supporter on Twitter.\n\nAmid it all, DeSantis has not gained much in primary polls-though he hasn't cratered, either.\n\nOver in Trumpworld, there remains a sense of almost uncomfortable sustained bemusement at how their top rival has handled the crucial early days of his campaign.\n\n\"I don't know how this is possible, but Ron DeSantis' official campaign is going worse than his shadow campaign,\" a Trump-aligned GOP strategist told The Daily Beast.\n\nTo assess the performance, The Daily Beast checked back in with a top strategist from Trump's 2016 campaign, who predicted last week that DeSantis needed a 10-point bump in the polls within 72 hours of his campaign launch or \"he's toast.\"\n\nThe strategist, who is sitting out the 2024 cycle, actually gave DeSantis higher marks, mostly for finally sharpening his attacks toward the former president.\n\n\"I honestly think he's hitting Trump hard,\" the strategist, citing a brief moment in a voter handshake line in New Hampshire where DeSantis took a swipe at Trump for not delivering enough over four years in office.\n\nThe Florida governor will need more such reviews if he is to gain serious traction as a threat to Trump in an increasingly crowded GOP primary field.\n\nIt's far from guaranteed. A moment from the trail earlier on Thursday morning showed DeSantis' lingering shakiness in more intimate settings, when he snapped at an Associated Press reporter for asking why voters were not given the chance to ask questions at the end of his remarks.\n\n\"Stop coming up to me, talking to me,\" DeSantis said after releasing himself from a smiling pose with a voter. \"People are coming up to me, talking to me. What are you talking about? Are you blind? Are you blind? People are coming up to me, talking to me whatever they want to talk to me about.\"\n\nThe video captured by NBC News reporter Jonathan Allen did not offer the most flattering picture for DeSantis, who had a separate Q&A session along with mini-press conferences after his events earlier in the week in Iowa.\n\n\"I saw a pic of him with Casey [DeSantis] on stage, but no video,\" the Trump 2016 strategist said, when asked whether the DeSantis campaign produced any good visuals after a campaign launch that was defined by the absence of any journalists. \"Which is why they need to let press in. Dumb for them not to.\"\n\nThe DeSantis campaign told The Daily Beast they would not be accepting any more RSVPs for their events on Thursday.\n\nThe campaign's troubles didn't end on the trail. Amid a contentious primary war to win over conservative influencers and right-wing media figures, the DeSantis press team inadvertently outed Fox News fixtures Clay Travis and Buck Sexton as attendees of the exclusive post-launch donor event that DeSantis held in Miami last week.\n\nDays later, Pushaw posted a front-facing photo of the crowd in an attempt to show how the campaign found the alleged leaker of audio from the retreat-which instantly put MAGA sleuths on the scent for any public figures who may not have wanted to advertise their presence at the DeSantis event.\n\nThis is the leaker, by the way. As you can see, not a member of our team. Team DeSantis does not leak. But larger events with many outside attendees sometimes run the risk of infiltration. Good thing that whatever we say reflects well on our team and leader. pic.twitter.com/Seg7m7PR5K\n\nTravis, who also appears for Fox Sports' gambling coverage , claimed he was just there to kick the tires on DeSantis as someone who \"regularly [attends] candidate events all over the country to hear from candidates in person.\" Later, he alluded to backlash he received from Trump supporters calling into his radio show , and deflected criticism by encouraging more listeners to call in.\n\nWhat hasn't been previously reported, according to a short video clip obtained by The Daily Beast, is that Travis actually spoke to attendees at the soiree at the Four Seasons in Miami, though the substance of his remarks remains unclear.\n\nRepresentatives for Travis and Sexton did not return a request for comment.\n\nThere were signs in DeSantis' first official spin as a candidate that his team is attempting to course-correct after months of scrutiny over his resistance to retail politics and engagement with the press.\n\nIn the campaign kickoff road tour, DeSantis was usually accompanied by his wife. Pitching questions to her husband and creating a softer contrast by talking about their three young children, the Florida first lady has long been expected by GOP campaign operatives to be an integral part of the campaign.\n\nAt one of the stops in New Hampshire on Thursday, she joked magic eraser can successfully remove crayon drawings from 18th century upholstery in the Florida governor's mansion.\n\nWhile DeSantis took questions from voters in Iowa, the New Hampshire visit was more of a mixed bag, with the governor avoiding a voter question portion entirely in Laconia and taking a handful of shouted questions later in the day.\n\n\"The real question is: Can Ron sell the voters?\" the Trump 2016 strategist said, crediting the DeSantis communications team for being disciplined in their attacks on Trump's record over the weekend.\n\nIn watching Trump on the trail, he appeared \"rattled,\" the former top adviser speculated.\n\nTheir hunch? The classified documents case led by Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\"I think they're shitting their pants over Jack Smith,\" the former Trump adviser theorized. \"I think Jack's gonna fry his ass. God, he's straight out of Tom Clancy.\"\n\nThe Trump-aligned strategist also pointed to second place as being up for grabs among the rest of the field, something the former president will be watching closely.\n\n\"Because of Ron DeSantis' failures, the race for second place is wide open,\" the MAGA loyalist predicted.\n\nCome on in, the water's warm\n\nTwo key entrants in the Never Trump lane of the 2024 GOP primary are set to enter the race as soon as next week, adding a new edge to a field of challengers that have so far taken\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who declared himself \"the Trump alternative\" in an interview with The Daily Beast during a pre-campaign swing through New Hampshire in April, is expected to make it official at a town hall event in that state on Tuesday, according to Axios .\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, will follow suit next Wednesday with an online video rollout and then a CNN town hall in Iowa later that night, according to ABC News .\n\nThe two entries, which have been long expected, seem to round out the GOP primary field-for now-at nine contenders.\n\nThat these two men are the field's de facto Trump critics is deeply ironic-and could undercut their chances to gain traction. Christie, a vocal Trump critic during the 2016 campaign, became something of a Trump supplicant during his presidency before breaking with him again. Pence, of course, was the man's No. 2, and has continued to defend his former boss in some respects even as he excoriates him over Jan. 6.\n\n\"I think maybe one of them could have a shot at it if they didn't have the baggage with Trump,\" a longtime New Hampshire Republican operative told The Daily Beast. \"But aside from Christie's potential to be a human torpedo on the debate stage, any success they might find early on will come at the expense of your Nikki Haleys, your Tim Scotts, and maybe even DeSantis.\"\n\nPolling Station\n\nOn that point, Scott's entrance already appears to have taken away prospective supporters from Pence and Haley. Nevertheless, the long view of the early contest shows the same thing, best visualized by FiveThirtyEight's tracker : stasis.\n\nTrump is still polling at just shy of 34 points ahead of DeSantis on average, a much bigger mountain for the Florida governor to climb than the roughly 15-point gap he was facing in March.\n\nFrom Harry Crane's Desk\n\nOutside spending is heating up, with a pro-Tim Scott PAC-TIM PAC, one of the more subtly-named out there-plunking down a $7.25 million ad buy through Labor Day in Iowa and New Hampshire, along with spots on national broadcasts and $1.25 million in online digital, according to Fox News .\n\nThe main ad's title, \"Believe,\" has an upbeat message more fitting for an episode of \"Ted Lasso\" than in the highly charged and often apocalyptically negative GOP primary field.\n\nCampaign Lit\n\nYou say DeSantis, I say DeSantis. Axios' Alex Thomspon and Sophia Cai took a stab at explaining why DeSantis appears to pronounce his name with distinctly different vowels and consonants-not just now, but in the past few weeks, and at various points in his decade-long political career.\n\nStoneception. The Daily Beast's Zachary Petrizzo obtained new footage from an upcoming documentary by Danish filmmakers showing Roger Stone bragging how easily he can manipulate Donald Trump.\n\n'A self-help guru who won't get help.' Trail Mix's own Jake Lahut scooped a staff shakeup at Marianne Willaimson's longshot campaign to primary President Biden, with the team losing 10 aides since launch just two months ago amid stories of the spiritual icon's abysmal treatment of staff.\n\nHow Target ended up over the target.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis' Bizarre Tribute to Hillary Clinton\n\nWhen you're 37 percentage points behind the frontrunner, what else can you do but borrow some of his best lines? \" Lock her up \" was the chilling anti- Hillary Clinton mantra that took over Donald Trump rallies in 2016, although once he won the election, President Trump admitted that was just for show , he didn't want to hurt the Clintons .\n\nResurrecting that oldy-but-goody is another way for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to highlight Trump's failure to deliver, when it would have been so easy once he was in the Oval Office to make good on his threat to name a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton after he got elected. (Trump even made the threat to her face during the second 2016 presidential debate .)\n\nIt's a curious tribute to Hillary Clinton that she endures as a demonized figure in the right-wing universe, as Trump whines he's being prosecuted in a partisan witch hunt, and he didn't even have a server in his basement like Hillary did! Lock her up!!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeSantis is such a dud on the campaign trail that it's unlikely he can ride to victory by claiming he'd be tougher on Hillary than Trump. He's already moved toward attacking Vice President Kamala Harris, mispronouncing her name like it's too exotic and referring to the \"Harris-Biden administration\" to feed the notion that this Black woman is about to take over since Biden has already lived beyond his expected actuarial age. It's pretty savage stuff.\n\nSearching for a way to make his point that Trump is being unfairly prosecuted in multiple indictments, he's said we don't want \"one side constantly trying to put the other side in jail.\" But he can't help rhapsodizing about \"those Trump rallies in 2016\" and how \" exciting \" it was \"chanting 'Lock Her Up' to put Hillary Clinton in jail.\"\n\nHow to explain DeSantis? Desperate people do desperate things. When people (and not just politicians) are pushed and under stress, they revert to their comfort zones. And for DeSantis, that means throwing red meat to the base. He's the king of the anti-woke, tough enough to take on Mickey Mouse and Bud Light. The DeSantis booth at Iowa's Lincoln Dinner last week featured a tower of Bud Light cans that attendees could knock down with a ball.\n\nDoes DeSantis really have that much animosity toward the parent corporations of these popular brands, Disney and AB InBev? Or is he doing it for political expediency in a Trumpified GOP that sees elites everywhere, the same way the late, disgraced Sen. Joe McCarthy once imagined communists in every nook and cranny.\n\nEither way-whether he's a true believer or an opportunistic imposter-it's not working for DeSantis.\n\nTrump crushes him in every measurable group in the latest New York Times -Siena College poll . Suburban women with college degrees or blue-collar women without college degrees, they prefer Trump by a wide margin. Whatever their age, gender, or geographic location, Republican voters want the real thing, not some Florida knockoff.\n\nRiffing on Hillary is yesterday's news and sadly something to be expected, but taking on Vice President Harris by slyly mocking her name is racist and sexist and xenophobic. It's the trifecta, three hits with one slur.\n\nThe Republican Party has been successful since 1980 with racially tinged wedge issues, which brought a sizable chunk of their base. They're watching it slip away, replaced with voters who don't like anybody picking on some demographic slice of the population.\n\nThe numbers are stunning.\n\nIn the eight years between Trump's election in 2016 and the 2024 election, 32 million Generation Z voters will have become eligible voters. This generation is concerned about equity, diversity, and inclusion, which DeSantis is trying to stamp out. And this generation votes at higher levels than previous generations at the same stage of life. During the same eight years from 2016 to 2024, some 20 million older Americans have died, taking their biases with them.\n\nSomebody like DeSantis can't imagine a world where these racist and sexist appeals don't work. He's never been in a real fight. When Trump says he created him, it's one of the rare times Trump is telling the truth. A grateful DeSantis did an ad showing him building a wall out of blocks with his kids, teaching his daughter to say, \"You're fired,\" and giving his infant son a red \"Make America Great Again\" onesie.\n\nOnce elected governor and then re-elected by a wide margin, DeSantis had a gerrymandered legislature that did whatever he wanted. A spate of anti-woke, anti-abortion, and pro-gun legislation followed. He's waging a 1980 war of wedge issues in 2023. They're not enough in a primary, and they would doom anybody not named Trump in 2024.\n\nBottom line: DeSantis will do whatever he thinks might work to preserve his presidential bona fides, and it's amazing that Republicans still get a kick out of hazing Hillary. After the 2016 election Trump told an enthusiastic crowd, \"That plays great before the election. Now, we don't care, right?\"\n\nHis voters disagreed. A HuffPost/YouGov survey found that 68 percent of Trump voters wanted the president-elect to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton.\n\nImagining Hillary Clinton behind bars must do for the right what imagining Trump in an orange jumpsuit does for Dems-and if that's the jackpot then, measured by indictments, Dems are a lot closer than the Hillary haters to realizing their dream.\n\neleanor.clift@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis' Yearbook Reveals He Didn't Always Hate AP\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWhen Florida Governor Ron DeSantis floated the possibility of eliminating Advanced Placement classes from his state's curriculum, he conveniently left out an important fact.\n\nDeSantis was once the \"AP US History student of the year,\" according to his high school yearbook, pages of which were obtained by The Daily Beast.\n\nBefore turning on AP classes in his latest culture war skirmish, the governor not only benefited from the rigorous courses as a high schooler at Dunedin High School, he also praised the Sunshine State's top three placement for students in AP courses in February 2020, calling the program \"a gateway to achieving success in college, career and ultimately in life.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow DeSantis is trying to sell a populist pitch that APs aren't worth the trouble, despite benefiting from the highly sought-after curriculum on his way to an Ivy League education.\n\nThe Florida governor's provocation to the College Board-the company that handles the Advanced Placement curriculum, as well as the SAT exam-is the culmination of a series of interventions DeSantis has made in Florida's public schools to suppress what his administration has called \"woke indoctrination.\" His blitz on education has also become a key plank of the impending DeSantis 2024 presidential campaign, with each new proclamation earning him praise on Fox News and across conservative media.\n\nThe Yale University and Harvard Law alumnus recently banned a new AP course on African-American studies , saying the interdisciplinary class violated Florida's \"Stop W.O.K.E. Act\" by veering into \"political\" topics and trying to \"shoehorn in Queer Theory.\"\n\n\"This course on Black history, what's one of the lessons about?\" DeSantis said at a press conference in January blasting the new class. \"Queer Theory. Now, who would say that's an important part of Black history, Queer Theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids.\"\n\nDeSantis has since extended that line of reasoning to float scrapping AP courses altogether in Florida. While AP classes are not taught at every public school in the United States-around 88 percent of public high school students attend a school offering them-Florida would be the first state to outright ban the curriculum, which is designed to give students a head start on college.\n\nBack in 1997, DeSantis received a commendation for doing just that.\n\n\"Ron 'D' DeSantis was awarded the AP American History Award in June of 1996, the Princeton Book Award along with athletic awards,\" the 1997 yearbook obtained by The Daily Beast says, while further listing out a series of baseball achievements.\n\nThe yearbook, titled \"A Unique Perspective,\" shows an accomplished young DeSantis headed off to play baseball at Yale, where he would later captain the team.\n\nThe graduation ceremony pamphlet from the same year obtained by The Daily Beast lists \"R. D. Desantis\" graduating Summa Cum Laude with National Honor Society status.\n\nA spokesperson for the DeSantis administration did not return The Daily Beast's request for comment.\n\nAs a replacement for AP courses, DeSantis suggested using international curricula such as the International Baccalaureate Exam and Cambridge Assessment. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, released a statement in response to the governor's suggestion by cautioning that the international programs \"don't provide the same breadth of course offerings and are not widely accepted by other colleges and universities.\"\n\nThe IB program is only taught at fewer than 1,000 schools nationwide, and includes a Social and Cultural Anthropology course using many of the same academic frameworks blasted by the DeSantis administration.\n\nCreated in Switzerland and loosely based on the French baccalauréat tradition, the IB diploma allows admission to French universities, while other countries such as the United Kingdom convert it to an equivalent grade or score in their system, sometimes with additional requirements.\n\nCompared to the AP curriculum, it's been described by Harvard University professor of developmental psychology Howard Gardner as \"less parochial\" and based more in \"interdisciplinary thinking.\"\n\nStill, IB courses remain concentrated in private schools, and Florida parents have been speaking out over their worries about opportunities being denied to their children.\n\n\"It terrifies me that DeSantis is threatening to eliminate AP classes after seeing how much it benefited my daughter's education,\" Colleen Hamilton, a parent of two children who went through Florida public schools, recently told The Washington Post.\n\n\"My number one concern as a parent right now is that my kids will be cut off from additional information about the world,\" parent and education activist Stephana Ferrell also told The Post . \"Will they be able to learn beyond what our state is going to allow them to know?\"\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis called hypocritical over rush to fill Republican House seats\n\nFlorida governor swiftly scheduled primaries to fill posts from Trump picks while Democratic district waited months\n\nThe Florida governor, Ron DeSantis , has been accused of hypocrisy over his rush to fill Republican House seats vacated by Donald Trump 's cabinet picks , as he had previously kept voters in a Democratic -held district waiting for more than nine months.\n\nCritics say his scheduling of 28 January primaries in solid Republican districts held by the former congressman Matt Gaetz , who resigned during his ill-fated nomination for attorney general, and Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, is a hasty political move designed purely to bolster speaker Mike Johnson's fragile House majority as soon as possible.\n\nIn Waltz's case, the primary ahead of a special election that will be held on 1 April is only eight days after his resignation takes effect.\n\nDeSantis's haste to fix those dates contrasts sharply with his lethargy following the death of the congressman Alcee Hastings in April 2021 that further reduced Democrats' single-digit House majority. He did not set the primary for Florida's 20th congressional district for seven months, and stalled the special election until January 2022, a full 280 days after Hastings died.\n\n\"Of course there's hypocrisy. Ron DeSantis deprived residents in Broward county of representation in the US Congress and made them wait nine months,\" said Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic party and member of DeSantis's cabinet until 2023 as the most recent Democrat to win a statewide election.\n\n\"Now, with the slimmest of majorities that any party has ever held since the 50-state creation of the US, they are rushing to get these elections held because with these two seats open, it creates an even smaller majority for the Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nFried said DeSantis's hurried approach is also detrimental to citizens who had hoped to vote by mail. A controversial law the governor signed in 2021 to reduce mail-in ballots requires voters to renew their registration every election cycle, instead of every four years, and Fried said many will be unaware their existing approvals will expire on 31 December.\n\n\"Because it is so early and he did it so fast, we're going to have a problem,\" she said.\n\n\"Come the end of the year, every single resident in our state who has a vote by mail ballot will have to re-enlist for it, so there is going to be a significant disadvantage to the residents of these two congressional districts. Will they be reminded they have to re-register and will their ballots arrive fast enough, in time to participate?\"\n\nDeSantis's office did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment.\n\nAnalysts of Florida politics, meanwhile, say DeSantis's maneuvering is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"Throughout his tenure in office, to an extent during his first term but in particular after his re-election, he has really been a governor who has pushed the limits of his constitutional authority and power to try to promote both conservative policy priorities and also the fortunes of the Republican party more generally,\" said Nicholas Seabrook, chair of the University of North Florida's department of political science and public administration.\n\n\"He scheduled these elections essentially as soon as was possible under Florida law, so it's hard not to look at that and conclude that, particularly given that the overall House majority was fairly narrow in both instances, a narrow Democratic majority coming out of the 2020 election, and an even narrower GOP majority coming out of 2024, that there's an element of politics in the situation.\n\n\"With Republicans planning a fairly ambitious legislative agenda for the beginning of the Trump administration , it would be a real dent in their ability to get anything done in the House if those seats are not filled quickly.\"\n\nSeabrook said DeSantis also appeared to be working for his own personal advantage, helping to re-establish himself on the national political stage after the embarrassment of his failed pursuit of the Republican 2024 presidential nomination.\n\n\"He certainly seems to be committed to the agenda he has set out for himself [but] in Florida, a lot of us wondered what was next for Ron DeSantis,\" he said.\n\n\"He's term-limited as governor, and it didn't look like there was any real prospect of another national office opening up, then suddenly there's two possible avenues. He could potentially run for Marco Rubio's Senate seat if Rubio gets confirmed as secretary of state, or could potentially become Donald Trump's defense secretary . So it does seem that things always work out for him.\n\n\"The defense secretary job would be potentially a more attractive one as a vehicle to position himself for a presidential bid [in 2028] than running from the Senate. Being a prominent member of the Trump administration , and hopefully not getting into too much hot water and ending up getting himself fired, can be a springboard.\"\n\nFried, too, thinks DeSantis would probably prefer a role in Trump's cabinet, and be able to utilize his pick to fill Rubio's Senate seat for further political capital, perhaps with Lara Trump , the president-elect's daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\n\"If he's going to be nominated for secretary of defense it's because a deal was cut,\" she said.\n\n\"This is not about qualifications, this is not about who's best to serve this state or country. This is about a quid pro quo between Trump and DeSantis that if in fact DeSantis is nominated it's because Lara Trump will be the next US senator from the state of Florida.\""

No federal employee should face death threats from anyone, least of all from someone seeking to lead the US government. Governor DeSantis must retract his irresponsible statement.\"\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThere seemed little chance of that, from a candidate who has made harsh rhetoric and confrontational poses cornerstones of a campaign nonetheless failing to outflank Trump on the right.\n\nIn Florida, Daniel Uhlfelder, a former Democratic candidate for state attorney general, pointed to controversies over DeSantis's past when he said : \"This guy started his legal career at Guantánamo Bay.\"\n\nAs a US navy lawyer, DeSantis was posted to the US facility on the coast of Cuba during the wars after 9/11. He has angrily denied being present at torture sessions, calling one former inmate's claims \"totally, totally BS\".\n\nIn Congress on Thursday, the Virginia Democratic senator Mark Warner said \"inflammatory, violent language\" like that used by DeSantis in New Hampshire \"can lead to very real, very dangerous consequences\".\n\nKelley of the AFGE agreed, linking DeSantis's violent imagery to deadly far-right violence.\n\n\"We've seen too often in recent years - from the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 to the sacking of the [US] Capitol on January 6 2021 - that violent anti-government rhetoric from politicians has deadly consequences.\"\n\nIn Oklahoma City, 168 people including 19 children were killed when a bomb planted by the rightwing extremist Timothy McVeigh destroyed a federal building. More than 500 people were injured.\n\nNine deaths have been linked to the attack on the Capitol, in which Trump supporters sought to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. More than a thousand people have been charged in relation to the riot, Trump among them after being indicted by the special counsel Jack Smith this week.\n\nEverett said: \"Any candidate who positions themselves within that shameful tradition has no place in public office.\""

      "text": "Ron DeSantis drops out of Republican presidential race\n\nHard-right Florida governor at one point thought to be future of party ends campaign to be GOP nominee\n\nRon DeSantis , the hard-right governor of Florida, has ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsed Donald Trump .\n\n\"It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,\" he said in a statement posted on X. \"He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.\"\n\nDeSantis's withdrawal in the days ahead of the New Hampshire primary follows a disappointing result in the Iowa caucus , where he finished second place but trailed Donald Trump by a large margin . In New Hampshire, his numbers were far behind former South Carolina governor Haley and Trump.\n\nOn Sunday night, Donald Trump set aside months of criticism of DeSantis and celebrated his onetime rival as his newest supporter.\n\n\"I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,\" Trump said. \"He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.\"\n\n\"He's been a good governor and I wish him well,\" Haley said at a campaign event on Sunday. \"Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.\"\n\nDeSantis's news was the culmination of a long, agonising decline.\n\nAs recently as spring 2023, the former navy lawyer and rightwing congressman was widely seen as the Republican most likely to stop Trump becoming the nominee for a third election running, in large part by attempting to offer harsh Trumpist policies without the attendant drama.\n\nIn November 2022, DeSantis cruised past the Democrat Charlie Crist to win a second term in Tallahassee. In his victory speech, he crowed: \"We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject 'woke' ideology.\"\n\nReferencing Winston Churchill, a near-mythic figure on the American right, he went on: \"We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools, we fight the woke in the corporations. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.\"\n\nHe received a rapturous reception, supporters with an eye on 2024 chanting \"two more years\" and the New York Post branding him \"DeFuture\", as speculation abounded that Rupert Murdoch was finally set to move on from Trump.\n\nBut despite formidable fundraising, a seemingly strong campaign structure, strong polling and a rising Republican star in his wife, Casey DeSantis , after a long run-in to a formal campaign declaration, little went right.\n\nDeSantis's hard-right agenda ran into trouble as he chose to take on Disney , a dominant employer in Florida, over its opposition to his \"don't say gay\" policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Generating a string of stories, scandals and lawsuits over book bans in school libraries, the subject continued to dog the campaign.\n\nIn May the launch of that campaign, a Twitter Spaces session with Elon Musk, descended into farce as the platform glitched and buckled. The event host, the donor David Sacks, claimed: \"We got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.\" Few observers agreed.\n\nOn the campaign trail in the months that followed, the governor came across as stilted and awkward. For a campaign focused on social media and the influencers who lurk there, the resultant string of mocking memes and threads could not have been in the plan.\n\nNor could a summer fiasco over bizarre campaign videos, posted to social media and featuring far-right, white supremacist, Nazi and arguably homoerotic imagery. A firing followed but the campaign's image had taken another big blow, reports of fundraising problems appearing .\n\nThere was a scandal over an attempt to change history teaching in state schools, regarding the place of slavery in Florida's past. There were attempts to troll Democrats on immigration, including sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run states by bus or plane. That policy ended up in the courts as well.\n\nAs the polling gap to Trump grew, and as the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley steadily moved through the field, DeSantis sought ways to fight back.\n\nIn November he took the unexpected step of debating a Democrat other than Joe Biden. The Fox News-hosted contest with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, proved little more than a sideshow. Brandishing a map he said showed the spread of \"human faeces\" on the streets of San Francisco, DeSantis succeeded only in feeding more \"poop map\" memes .\n\nDeSantis and Haley became more willing to attack Trump as the first vote neared, if still with the gloves kept on, even Trump's lie about a stolen election in 2020 proving hard to simply disown. In Iowa, DeSantis picked up key nominations from the governor, Kim Reynolds, and evangelical leaders and eventually finished in second. But that still didn't catapult his campaign into safe New Hampshire territory, and he dropped out before the numbers could prove just how far behind he might be.\n\nDemocrats celebrated the news on Sunday.\n\n\"As Democrats, we've been shouting from the rooftops that his strategy of waging culture wars on the backs of hardworking Floridians just to further his own ambitions was wrong for the state & would be disastrous for the nation,\" said Fentrice Driskell , the lead Democrat in the Florida state legislature on Twitter/X.\n\nSarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: \"Just like Trump, DeSantis ran a campaign pledging to ban abortion nationwide, rip away access to healthcare, and gut Social Security and Medicare, while embracing election deniers and whitewashing January 6. Whichever candidate wins the race for the Maga base will be left running on the same dangerous and unpopular anti-freedom agenda that voters will reject in November.\"\n\nFor its part, the New Hampshire electorate did not seem too shaken by his last-minute announcement.\n\nTwo hours before an event he had planned in New Hampshire, there were no signs of the DeSantis campaign or his fans at The Farm Bar and Grille. A member of staff said they had found out from news reports that DeSantis wouldn't be coming and said he had not yet pre-paid for the space.\n\n\"Nope, I'm about to charge him right now.\"\n\nAdam Gabbatt contributed reporting from New Hampshire"

DeSantis also said he wanted to, potentially, get up to 900 more associated positions \"off the books\" by scrapping 70 \"redundant\" entities such as advisory bodies.\n\nDemocrats were quick to point out that Florida already has a voter-approved government efficiency taskforce , which was set up in 2006 with an almost identical mandate. DeSantis's new efficiency team, they asserted, was itself an example of unnecessary spending, and a performative exercise of jumping on the Doge bandwagon to align himself with Donald Trump's slash-and-burn approach to various taxpayer-funded federal agencies.\n\n\"Republicans have been in total control of Florida's government for nearly 30 years, and he wants to talk about government waste?\" Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic party, said in a statement .\n\n\"Ron has consistently passed the largest state budgets in Florida's history, illegally spent millions of taxpayer dollars to run political campaigns, and just allocated $250m to fund his political stunt on immigration. Don't lecture us on wasting taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nAnother level of perceived resistance came on Tuesday from an unexpected source: the leaders of both of Florida's Republican-dominated legislative chambers.\n\n\"Let's focus on what matters. Let's pass actual reforms rather than symbolic gestures,\" Daniel Perez, the Florida house speaker, told members following DeSantis's address.\n\n\"Let's repeal government programs instead of reshuffling them. Let's swing for the fences and not just try to get on base.\"\n\nPerez has previously noted that DeSantis, a self-styled fiscal conservative, benefited from a 70% budget increase for the executive office of the governor over his six years in office.\n\nHe and the senate president, Ben Albritton, clashed with DeSantis in January over the governor's demand for a special legislative session to advance his immigration agenda. The parties came together to eventually pass a mutually acceptable hardline bill, but observers say tensions remain.\n\nIn remarks to the senate , Albritton, a member of the existing efficiency taskforce, said he was proud that Florida already \"has a great framework for accountability\", and that he and other lawmakers had made a substantive number of recommendations \"to improve flexibility [and] simplify processes\".\n\n\"The fact is we are a state and nation of laws that should be created by elected officials accountable to the people who elected them, not appointed professional staff,\" he said.\n\nSome observers noted that, after forcefully pushing both his Doge measure, and the related but unprecedented pitch to replace Florida's $40bn-a-year property tax structure with an as yet unspecified alternative, DeSantis was relatively quiet about them during his Tallahassee address on Tuesday.\n\nHe said \"taxpayers need relief\" from high property taxes, which he said made owners in effect tenants of the government, and that lawmakers were working on a proposal for \"constitutional protections for Florida property owners\" to place before voters in the 2026 election.\n\n\"DeSantis's latest scheme to eliminate property taxes threatens the very services that keep our communities safe and functioning. These taxes fund schools, fire departments, police, trash pickup, and safety on our roads and in our water, among other essential services,\" said Jared Nordlund, Florida director of the civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS.\n\n\"Eliminating them will drive local governments into financial ruin, allowing the state to seize more control, a blatant attack on home rule and local democracy.\n\n\"By the way, where was the update on his much-hyped Doge initiative? Just weeks ago, DeSantis promised a major push on this program, yet there was not a single mention. Was it just another empty headline grab? Floridians deserve answers, not political theater.\"\n\nDeSantis's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, the Floridian reported that Republican state representative Ryan Chamberlin was working on legislation to eliminate property taxes.\n\nThe non-partisan Tax Foundation, meanwhile, questioned the advantage to Florida, which has no state income tax, of abolishing the traditional system by which state and local governments raise money.\n\n\"The property tax is a relatively economically efficient tax. It corresponds better than most taxes to the benefits that people receive by paying it,\" said Jared Walczak, the group's vice-president of state projects.\n\n\"The value of your home is not a perfect proxy for the value of local services you receive, but it is a far better approximation than you would get with, say, an income tax where sometimes you're getting an inverse relationship between payment and benefits.\n\n\"Most economists say property tax is a fairly good tax and therefore efforts to eliminate it are misguided. If Florida really had the revenue to eliminate the property tax, there are so many better things the state could do. If they don't have that capacity, they would have to raise another tax or potentially dramatically reduce spending, and that could just be a very bad trade off.\""

      "text": "Why Ron DeSantis's Florida slavery curriculum is so dangerous\n\nBy denying the true ills of slavery, DeSantis is working to release the government from the obligation of fixing inequality today\n\nI n the mid-20th century, a generation after the civil war, the United Daughters of the Confederacy set out to rebrand the image of slavery. The group, composed of female descendants of Confederate soldiers, was fixated on returning the country's social order to its antebellum racial hierarchy. It sought to reimagine slavery as a benign institution, and to glorify the \" lost cause \" of white southern insurrectionists who attempted to overthrow the government in slavery's defense. The place that served as ground zero for the UDC's revisionist-history effort? Schools.\n\nIn one of its most successful campaigns, the UDC called for the widespread adoption of textbooks that trivialized the horrors of slavery. As a result, a 1954 middle school textbook titled History of Georgia claimed that a typical slave owner \"often had a barbecue or picnic for his slaves. The [enslaved] often had a great frolic. Even while working in the cotton fields they sang songs.\" (It is no coincidence that the book was published the same year the NAACP won the supreme court case to desegregate public schools.) And while most contemporary school texts have since moved towards acknowledging that slavery and the subsequent Jim Crow era were reprehensible, organized efforts against teaching accurate racial history continue to occur.\n\nThe UDC's legacy of revision emerged again in Florida recently, when the Republican governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis introduced legislation that would de-emphasize racism in the state's public education curricula. Last week, DeSantis announced that Florida texts will teach students that slavery benefited African Americans who \"gained skills\" that \"eventually parlayed ... into doing other things in life\". Civil-rights leaders, educators, and scholars were quick to criticize this minimization of slavery's cruelty as ignorance at best and deliberate misrepresentation at worst. Vice-President Kamala Harris even reacted, calling the policy an attempt \"to replace history with lies\".\n\nThe backlash to DeSantis's move is warranted and necessary, but most of the critiques miss the mark on identifying the Florida law's deeper insidiousness. What the architects of this legislation are really attempting to do - as the UDC attempted a century before - is galvanize a political right and hold on to conservative white rule in a country with rapidly changing demographics. By denying the true ills of slavery, DeSantis is working to release the American government from the obligation of correcting for its present-day inequalities. The violence of slavery is not just limited to a series of heinous acts that happened in the past, it also includes a deliberate process of disinformation that enables future generations to maintain the power yielded by that violence.\n\nThough DeSantis's career has relied heavily on making power gains by denying violence , the political strategy is not his invention. The practice of violence denial has long been a hallmark of the modern world's most oppressive regimes. Take, for example, the British empire. During her 21st birthday address in 1947, the heir apparent Elizabeth II memorably declared that her life would be lived in \"service of our great imperial family to which we all belong\". Her characterization of upholding Britain's unrelenting and exploitative colonial system as \"service\", and her assertion of an \"imperial family\" that included subjugated African, Asian and Caribbean people, are examples of the same whitewashing tactic employed by DeSantis. Even his efforts to ban \"controversial\" texts were cribbed - the British crown consistently prohibited books that challenged colonial rule in conquered territories.\n\nAnother world power that has sought to subvert the historical record is Turkey, with regard to the government's refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide. To aid in its denial, Turkey spent millions of dollars to control the massacre's narrative and enacted laws that criminalized anyone who accurately used the term \"genocide\" in reference to the killing, starvation and forced removal of an estimated 800,000 to 1.5 million Armenians in the country from 1915 to 1916. Even today, Turkish loyalists dismiss dissenters who speak up about the genocide as having an agenda or being backed by foreign agitators.\n\nUltimately, regimes exploit disinformation about the past because the truth threatens their grip on power. But it should surprise no one when those tactics to win a political advantage also spill over into present-day issues. DeSantis's war on reality doesn't stop at slavery. During the pandemic, his administration also banned mandates on masks, quarantines and vaccines, and suppressed facts about the ballooning number of Covid cases, even as the death toll for Floridians soared ahead of other states.\n\nCalling out the information that DeSantis and his supporters are distorting in textbooks and other messaging is important. However, it is just as important to not lose sight of the larger threat that violence denial poses for societies. Organized efforts to document and broadcast the truth of our past are the most significant defense we have against disinformation."

      "text": "Ron DeSantis: 10 things to know about the Republican White House hopeful\n\nThe Florida governor claims 'blue-collar roots' and an Ivy League education but has pursued hard-right policies as he seeks to take on Trump\n\nR on DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, has officially announced his candidacy for the GOP's 2023 presidential nomination. DeSantis joins a field currently dominated by Donald Trump, the GOP's most popular candidate, and is widely expected to become his chief contender.\n\nHere are 10 things to know about Ron DeSantis:\n\nDeSantis, 44, was born in Jacksonville, Florida, to an Italian-American family. Described as a \"native Floridian with blue-collar roots\", DeSantis was raised in Dunedin, a city on Florida's Gulf coast by his mother who worked as a nurse and his father who installed Nielsen TV ratings boxes.\n\nDeSantis graduated from Yale in 2001 with a BA in history. During his time at Yale, DeSantis was captain of the varsity baseball team. After graduation, DeSantis briefly taught at Darlington school, a private boarding school in Rome, Georgia. In a New York Times story published last November, a former student at Darlington said that while teaching civil war history, DeSantis had tried to \"play devil's advocate that the South had good reason to fight that war, to kill other people, over owning people - Black people\". After Darlington, DeSantis went on to attend Harvard Law School and graduated in 2005 with cum laude honors.\n\nAt Harvard, DeSantis earned a commission in the US navy as a judge advocate general's corps (JAGs) officer. In 2006, DeSantis was stationed at the detention center in Guantánamo Bay. In an Al Jazeera op-ed published last month, former Guantánamo detainee Mansoor Adayfi claimed that DeSantis was present and was \"smiling and laughing\" while Adayfi was being force-fed by guards in an attempt to end his hunger strike. DeSantis contested Adayfi's accusation, calling it \"totally BS\". In 2007, DeSantis was deployed to Iraq and served as a legal adviser to Seal Team One. He was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal.\n\nIn 2012, DeSantis ran for Congress and went on to serve three terms before retiring in 2018 to run for governor. In 2015, DeSantis helped form the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus with the aim of shifting Republican leadership and policies as far right as possible. As the representative of Florida's sixth congressional district, DeSantis routinely supported budget cuts to social security and Medicare. In 2013, DeSantis voted on a failed budget resolution that proposed raising the social security retirement age to 70.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, DeSantis remained staunchly opposed to Covid-19 precautionary measures including lockdowns and mask mandates. He has also widely spread Covid-19 vaccine denialism. In 2021, as Florida experienced record-breaking surges in Covid-19 cases, DeSantis dismissed the spikes as \"seasonal\" and called the growing struggle faced by states' hospitals \"media hysteria\". Earlier this year, DeSantis announced a proposal to permanently ban Covid-19 mandates in the state. The governor's aggressive stance has since earned him a variety of nicknames online including the \"Pied Piper\" , \"Deathsantis\" and \"DeSatan\" .\n\nSince becoming governor, DeSantis has launched a war against \"woke\" culture in Florida and signed into law a slew of bills that civil rights organizations have widely condemned as violations of individual freedoms. In 2022, DeSantis approved the so-called \"don't say gay \" ban which prohibits discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity at school across all grade levels. In January, DeSantis banned African American studies from the state's high schools, saying that the course \"lacks educational value\". He also signed a bill approving a six-week abortion ban in the state and has announced plans to block state colleges from having programs on diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory.\n\nFollowing DeSantis's fight against LGBTQ+ rights in Florida and pressure from its own employees, Disney - one of the state's biggest employers - publicly opposed the so-called \"don't say gay\" ban last year. DeSantis retaliated by seizing control of Disney's self-governing special district near Orlando and assumed new powers which allow him to appoint members of the development board that supervises the theme park. DeSantis has proposed building low-income housing on land next to the theme parks and also touted building a state prison in the area.\n\nAs an incentive to attract police officers from other states who are frustrated by Covid-19 vaccination requirements, DeSantis launched a new law enforcement relocation program on which he has spent $13.5m to date. The program offers a one-time $5,000 bonus for new recruits. However, a recent study of state documents found that among the nearly 600 officers who relocated to Florida, a \"sizable number\" have a slew of complaints against them or have since had criminal charges filed against them. Those charges include murder, as well as domestic battery and kidnapping.\n\nA former television host and mother of three children, Casey DeSantis has been described as her husband's \"biggest asset\", from helping him contour his face to playing a high-profile role by her husband's side during recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In 2019, Casey DeSantis was reported to have helped push out staff members of Florida's Republican party who were seen as more loyal to Donald Trump than to her husband. Not unfamiliar with the public eye, Casey is widely regarded as being responsible for reshaping her husband's public persona, which has been described as \"insular and standoffish\", to a \"warmer\" demeanor.\n\nWith DeSantis officially in the presidential race, the governor is widely expected to become the chief challenger to Donald Trump, the GOP's main contender and a former ally of his. Last year, Trump warned DeSantis not to run for president and threatened to reveal information about him should he run. Meanwhile, DeSantis, who has largely framed himself as \"Maga without the mess\", has taken veiled jabs at Trump, who is embroiled in his own legal scandals. \"We must reject the culture of losing that has impacted our party in recent years,\" DeSantis said earlier this month."

      "text": "Ron DeSantis tried to crusade against undocumented students. Florida is fighting back\n\nLatest anti-immigration agenda pushes to strip in-state tuition rates from tens of thousands of college students\n\nIt was a week in which two of Ron DeSantis 's flagship culture war crusades - education and immigration - collided. And it did not end well for Florida 's hard-right Republican governor.\n\nAlongside a revolt by previously loyal lawmakers upset by DeSantis's \"power grab\" in trying to write and impose immigration law, he also found himself under fire from tens of thousands of undocumented college and university students furious at his push to strip them of in-state tuition rates.\n\nDeSantis and the legislature want to end the in-state tuition waiver, which was granted to certain undocumented students in 2014 under a Republican-sponsored bill that its sponsor, then state congresswoman Jeanette Nuñez, said blended \" compassion and common sense\" .\n\nNow, as Florida's lieutenant governor and one of DeSantis's most fervently loyal acolytes, Nuñez has reversed course and decided that the law she once championed instead incentivizes illegal immigration.\n\nScores of those who will be affected gathered at rallies and mock graduations across Florida this week to protest against the move. They say it could almost quadruple what they would be made to pay to attend state-run campuses, and in many cases force them to abandon their education altogether.\n\nYet advocacy groups see a possible opening in the unprecedented infighting . The governor and legislature, they say, are trying to \"out-Trump\" each other in a rush to see who can come up with the harshest immigration agenda. Nothing could end up becoming law if they will not support each other's proposals.\n\n\"In the chaos of what is happening in Florida, we're seeing opportunities to show what's happening and get Floridians to use their voice to speak out against it,\" said Gaby Pacheco, president and chief executive of thedream.us , which supports undocumented immigrant youth at college and in their careers.\n\n\"Some of these students are teenagers who are looking at adults for support, help and leadership, and the adults in the room are willing to throw every single one of these young people under the bus for political gains and to show how tough they are.\"\n\nDeSantis appears to have been upset most by the lawmakers' stance on other immigration measures. They passed this week their own immigration law, the so-called Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy (Trump) Act. That law was modified with White House assistance and looked to be a thinly disguised attempt at sucking up to the new president. It included axing the in-state waiver.\n\nBut the governor denounced the act as \"weak-sauce\" compared with his own proposals , even though they include draconian measures such as a mandatory death penalty for immigrants convicted of certain crimes of violence. He has promised to veto the Trump Act .\n\nAnalysts say DeSantis was rattled by the snub, attending a series of hastily arranged roundtables across Florida at which he continued to slam his fellow Republicans, threatening those who crossed him by promising to fund their opponents in upcoming primaries. Meanwhile, DeSantis supporters and staffers, whose salaries are taxpayer-funded, launched a furious social media blitz against the governor's new critics.\n\nThat further angered the Republican Florida house speaker, Daniel Perez, who on Monday abruptly \"gaveled out\" a special legislative session on immigration that DeSantis summoned lawmakers to attend. Perez did so almost as soon as it began.\n\n\"Of course you're going to have your handful of politicians, a small group of activists and a lot of paid bots on social media trying to gaslight you,\" Perez told house colleagues.\n\n\"But we know that truth matters, and simply saying that something is terrible over and over doesn't actually make it true. Threatening others to get your way isn't leadership, it's immaturity.\"\n\nAdding further intrigue to the Republican power struggle in Tallahassee are moves by minority Democrats. Some have suggested they would be open to supporting Republicans in overriding DeSantis's veto of the Trump Act if the reversal of the in-state tuition waiver was removed; and state senate minority leader, Jason Pizzo, said he planned to introduce his own immigration legislation that he believes can win bipartisan support.\n\nFor their part, the students say they are weary of being used as pawns by feuding politicians who all seem determined to curb their opportunities.\n\n\"It's disheartening to see the questions the students are asking, like 'I'm doing so well in school, I've been doing my part, and now I'm being told I can't go to college?,'\" Pacheco said.\n\n\"Let's be clear, we're going from somebody who is already paying about $6,000 a year for their tuition and fees to now being told they need to pay $22,000 when their families are making maybe $35,000 to $40,000 a year as immigrants.\n\n\"The reality is that they're not just taking away the in-state tuition, they're taking away their ability to go to college altogether.\"\n\nSeveral student and immigration advocacy groups in Florida have come together to oppose the measure they say will affect more than 40,000 young people, and rob many of their education dreams.\n\n\"That they're going head first and targeting youth is unfortunately a very political, partisan thing. For me it's important because of my identity and because I benefited from it,\" said Idalia Quinteros, an activist with the Florida Student Power Network.\n\nQuinteros said she came to Florida from El Salvador when she was eight, and graduated from Miami-Dade's honors college as an undocumented immigrant through the public education system.\n\n\"Immigrant students, undocumented students, don't qualify for any financial aid, we don't qualify for the majority of scholarships, we can't apply for loans. Our parents, if they're also immigrants, can't apply for loans for us, so the financial hardship is already a lot as it is, and eliminating in-state tuition would be adding back another huge obstacle,\" she said.\n\n\"There's so much hypocrisy because Republicans supported it and now they're backtracking because they want to look good in front of Trump. And now it's like who takes the credit, the governor or the Republican legislators?\n\n\"It's disappointing because they're going after our immigrant families and attacking communities instead of focusing on the real issues that Florida is having.\""

      "text": "Ron DeSantis accused of 'intimidation campaign' against abortion rights\n\nFlorida voters report law enforcement personnel visits that appear to be part of drive to block passage of Amendment 4\n\nRon DeSantis is making a concerted effort to maintain draconian limits on abortion access in Florida that have led to accusations the rightwing Republican governor is conducting a \"state-sponsored intimidation campaign\" against abortion rights and trampling on civil liberties in the state.\n\nA near total ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect in Florida in May after the state supreme court ruled that the right to an abortion was no longer covered by the privacy clause in the Florida constitution.\n\nPassage of legislation called Amendment 4 would change the state constitution to prohibit government interference with the right to an abortion before the viability of a fetus, which typically begins around the 24th week of a pregnancy.\n\nBut registered voters in Florida have recently reported unannounced visits from law enforcement personnel that appear to be part of an all-out drive by DeSantis to use state government agencies and public funds to block passage of Amendment 4, which would enshrine in the state constitution a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nThe experience of Isaac Menasche is a cautionary tale. In early September, Menasche received an unexpected visitor at his home in the Florida Gulf coast city of Fort Myers - a plainclothes detective with a badge and a folder stuffed with documents containing Menasche's personal information.\n\nThey included copies of his driver's license and a petition form he had signed months ago at a local farmer's market on behalf of a campaign to qualify a pro-choice referendum for the statewide ballot in this year's general election.\n\nThe detective who turned up on Menasche's doorstep wanted to know why his signature on the petition form did not match the one on his driver's license. The retired 71-year-old attorney conceded the point but explained that his signature can sometimes vary. The officer left shortly thereafter.\n\n\"The experience left me shaken,\" wrote the New Jersey native on his Facebook page that same day. \"It was obvious to me that a significant effort was exerted to determine if indeed I had signed the petition. Troubling that so much resources were devoted to this.\"\n\nDeSantis initially asked the Florida supreme court to declare the ballot measure unconstitutional on the grounds that its language was vague and misleading. When that ploy failed last April, DeSantis shifted gears: in July a senior official in the state government department in charge of elections announced a review for possible fraud of tens of thousands of petition signatures collected in four counties in support of Amendment 4.\n\nIn more recent weeks, the state-run Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has launched a website opposing the initiative on the grounds that it \"threatens women's safety\". It has also spent millions of dollars on television ads urging Florida voters to reject the proposed amendment.\n\n\"We're seeing a state-sponsored intimidation campaign to make Floridians scared of voicing support for abortion access,\" says Keisha Mulfort, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida which filed a lawsuit earlier this month seeking to halt the AHCA's anti-Amendment 4 media campaign.\n\n\"Florida's leadership has made it clear they don't trust women to make decisions about their own healthcare,\" she added. \"They'll go to great lengths to demonstrate they don't support the democratic process, including sending law enforcement personnel to the homes of private citizens.\"\n\nDeSantis recently defended the state-funded anti-amendment website and television ads as \"public service announcements\" similar to those produced by the Florida department of transportation to encourage safe driving.\n\n\"It's being used by the AHCA agency to basically provide people with accurate information,\" said the governor during a roundtable discussion held in a Miami suburb on 9 September. \"Everything that is put out is factual. That's been done for decades, it's not electioneering, and it is not inappropriate at all.\"\n\nThe AHCA communications office failed to respond to a list of written questions submitted by the Guardian about the agency's website and electronic media campaign. The governor's communications director, Bryan Griffin, turned down The Guardian's request for an interview with DeSantis, asserting that the newspaper was \"completely consumed with left wing activism and does nothing to actually inform the public.\"\n\nUnder a law passed by the Republican-dominated Florida legislature, ballot measures must be approved by 60% of the electorate, and Amendment 4 proponents say they are confident of meeting that threshold in the general election scheduled for 5 November.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nTo bolster his case against the pro-choice amendment proposal, DeSantis has even questioned the legitimacy of passing laws through popular referendums, even though that mechanism is authorized by the state constitution.\n\n\"It takes power away from the people to be able to decide this through elections and who they elect to office and who legislates,\" he told a press conference recently. \"It effectively puts it in the courts, and there will be 25 years' worth of lawsuits on what any of these terms mean.\"\n\nIn a letter dated 25 January of this year, the Florida department of state's division of elections confirmed that the six organizations in support of the pro-choice referendum had collected enough valid signatures to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the November ballot.\n\nSix months later, however, a deputy secretary of that same state government department revealed in a letter that his office had received \"alarming information\" from the Palm Beach county supervisor of elections office about \"fraudulent constitutional initiative petitions\" that were submitted by 35 individuals who had been hired to collect signatures on behalf of Amendment 4.\n\nThis apparent attempt to reopen the signature validity issue was replicated in three other counties in Florida, and as of two weeks ago an estimated 36,000 signatures are currently under review by an election fraud unit that was established by legislation that DeSantis signed into law two years ago.\n\nThe Palm Beach county supervisor of elections, Wendy Sartory Link, received an email four weeks ago from that deputy secretary of state, Brad McVay, asking her office to review 17,637 petition forms that were certified as valid by her office last winter.\n\nThe elections supervisor said the request from McVay was \"not a common practice\" that she had encountered in the five years since she was appointed to the position by DeSantis. Link is running for re-election this year as a Democrat, and she suggested that the entire exercise might be an academic one at this juncture.\n\n\"It doesn't really apply to us,\" she said. \"The initiative was certified, and it's on our ballots.\""

      "text": "Ron DeSantis signs Florida social media ban for children into law\n\nLaw will ban social media accounts for children under 14 once it takes effect but must still withstand expected legal challenges\n\nThe Florida governor, Ron DeSantis , has signed a law that has given his state one of the US's most restrictive social media bans for minors, though it must still withstand expected legal challenges.\n\nOnce it takes effect, the bill signed on Monday bans social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for 14- and 15-year-olds. It was slightly watered down from a proposal DeSantis vetoed earlier in March, a week before the annual legislative session ended.\n\nThe new law was the top legislative priority for Republican state house speaker, Paul Renner. It takes effect on 1 January.\n\n\"A child in their brain development doesn't have the ability to know that they're being sucked into these addictive technologies and to see the harm and step away from it, and because of that we have to step in for them,\" Renner said at a ceremony for the bill signing held at a Jacksonville school.\n\nThe bill DeSantis vetoed would have banned minors under 16 from popular social media platforms regardless of parental consent. But before the veto, he worked out compromise language with Renner to alleviate the governor's concerns, and the legislature sent DeSantis a second bill.\n\nSeveral states have considered similar legislation. In Arkansas, a federal judge in August blocked enforcement of a law that required parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts.\n\nSupporters in Florida hope the bill will withstand legal challenges because it would ban social media formats based on addictive features such as notification alerts and autoplay videos, rather than on their content.\n\nRenner said he expects social media companies to \"sue the second after this is signed\".\n\n\"But you know what? We're going to beat them,\" Renner remarked. \"We're going to beat them and we're never, ever going to stop.\"\n\nDeSantis also acknowledged the law will be challenged on free speech rights enshrined in the US constitution's first amendment. He also bemoaned the fact the Stop Woke Act he signed into law two years ago was recently struck down by an appeals court with a majority of Republican-appointed judges. They ruled it violated free speech rights by banning private business from including discussions about racial inequality in employee training.\n\n\"Any time I see a bill, if I don't think it's constitutional, I veto it,\" said DeSantis, a lawyer, expressing confidence that the social media ban will be upheld. \"We not only satisfied me, but we also satisfied, I think, a fair application of the law and constitution.\"\n\nKhara Boender, a state policy director for the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said in a news release that she understood the concern for online safety but expressed doubt the law would \"meaningfully achieve those goals without infringing on the first amendment rights of younger users\".\n\nShe also anticipated a legal challenge.\n\n\"This law could create substantial obstacles for young people seeking access to online information, a right afforded to all Americans regardless of age,\" Bonder said.\n\nThe bill overwhelmingly passed both of Florida's legislative chambers, with some Democrats joining a majority of Republicans who supported the measure. Opponents argued it is unconstitutional and government should not interfere with decisions parents make with their children.\n\n\"This bill goes too far in taking away parents' rights,\" the Democratic state house representative Anna Eskamani said in a news release. \"Instead of banning social media access, it would be better to ensure improved parental oversight tools, improved access to data to stop bad actors, alongside major investments in Florida's mental health systems and programs.\""

      "text": "Inside Ron DeSantis's Quest to Trample the Will of Florida Voters on Abortion\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Florida governor is taking unprecedented steps to undermine citizen-led efforts to protect abortion rights and legalize marijuana.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has spent the last year throwing the full weight of his administration behind killing Amendment 4, a citizen-led ballot initiative to enshrine the right to an abortion \"before viability\" in the state constitution.\n\nDeSantis's opposition to the amendment is not altogether surprising - if approved by voters in the November election, it would effectively invalidate a six-week abortion ban that he signed into law, which went into effect in May. But his tactics have been raising alarm bells, even from within his administration. Earlier this month, the general counsel for the Florida Department of Health resigned in protest over cease-and-desist letters he claimed DeSantis's office ordered him to send to television stations that aired an ad in support of the proposed amendment.\n\nThe letters were just the latest in a series of drastic steps the governor has taken to interfere with direct democracy this election cycle. DeSantis's administration has taken to the courts to block the abortion amendment, which made it onto the ballot with the support of 1 million Floridians, as well as another citizen-led effort to legalize marijuana. The governor has deployed the state's election police to intimidate petition signers, and used state agencies and systems to spread misinformation about what both amendments would do. And according to estimates , he's spent more than $19 million of public money along the way.\n\nDemocracy and voting rights experts say that these efforts are all a part of DeSantis's well-worn anti-democratic playbook, pointing to the series of voter restrictions pushed through by DeSantis and his allies, including a law that created an office focused on investigating alleged election crimes . And if he succeeds in quashing the amendments, critics argue, there will be no reining him in. DeSantis's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"There's been an intentional weaponization of every state agency to pursue his political agenda,\" said Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando. \"And, of course, that's been centered on Amendment 4, but it's been a pattern of behavior on several fronts.\"\n\nThe DeSantis administration and allied state officials have relied heavily on the legal system and courts to stifle both the abortion ballot measure and the separate effort to legalize marijuana, Amendment 3.\n\nState law requires the attorney general to ask the Florida Supreme Court if proposed constitutional amendments meet certain legal requirements. In doing so, the attorney general can also make an argument for or against it. Attorney General Ashley Moody argued that both amendments did not pass legal muster and tried to block them from appearing on the ballot. The court was unimpressed with her arguments. In April, the court rejected Moody's claim that Amendment 3 was unclear and improperly drafted to cover multiple subjects, since it would both decriminalize and commercialize recreational marijuana.\n\nIn a separate opinion that same month, the court rejected Moody's argument that voters might be confused at the scope of Amendment 4. \"[T]he broad sweep of this proposed amendment is obvious in the language of the summary,\" the court ruled in a particularly biting decision. \"Denying this requires a flight from reality.\"\n\nState law also requires that a financial impact statement appear beside citizen-led initiatives on the ballot. Last year, a four-person panel stacked with DeSantis loyalists drafted a financial impact statement for Amendment 4. According to Keisha Mulfort, senior communications adviser for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, \"typically\" these statements will simply say that the financial impact is \"indeterminate.\"\n\nAnd that's what the panel said about Amendment 4 at first. At the time, Florida's six-week abortion ban was tied up in litigation, and the panelists wrote that the uncertainty of the outcome made it such that \"the impact of the proposed amendment on state and local government revenues and costs, if any, cannot be determined.\"\n\nAfter the Florida Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect, a judge ordered the panel to revise the financial impact statement, arguing that it was \"unclear and confusing.\" Read Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe panel's members are two representatives selected by DeSantis; one person appointed by Republican House Speaker Paul Renner, an outspoken opponent of Amendment 4; and conference chair and coordinator of Florida Economic and Demographic Research, Amy Baker. After meeting again in July, the panel released a revised statement.\n\n\"The financial impact statement was written by the same politicians who want to keep this extreme abortion ban in place.\"\n\n\"The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida,\" the new statement reads. \"The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions. There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds. Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state government and state courts that will negatively impact the state budget.\"\n\nBaker was the only dissenter.\n\nAdvocates for Amendment 4 were swift to call out the misleading language in the statement, which they unsuccessfully challenged in court. In a statement , the ACLU of Florida took particular issue with the speculation about future litigation, arguing that the statement should have been a \"neutral explanation\" of the amendment's likely impact to the budget, and contending that DeSantis and his loyalists hijacked the process for political gain.\n\n\"The intention of the government was to mislead people,\" said Mulfort. \"The financial impact statement was written by the same politicians who want to keep this extreme abortion ban in place. They know that their position is deeply unpopular and they have resorted to unfair and deceptive tactics to trick voters.\"\n\nIn September, a police detective showed up at Isaac Menasche's home. The officer questioned Menasche about whether he signed the petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot, according to an account Menasche later posted to Facebook . \"The experience has left me shaken,\" wrote Menasche, who said police arrived with a 10-page dossier on him, which included a copy of his driver's license and a copy of the petition he signed.\n\nAlthough the full scope of the investigation is unclear, additional petition signers have come forward saying they were questioned by law enforcement about the initiative. And the state's Office of Election Crimes and Security reportedly opened over 40 separate investigations into petition gatherers on the campaign.\n\nNatasha Sutherland, senior adviser to the Yes on 4 campaign, said it's hard to read what happened to voters like Menasche as anything other than an intimidation tactic. \"Knocking on folks' doors, scaring them from engaging in the democratic process, the citizens initiative process, it's really unfortunate and harmful to the democratic process,\" she said.\n\nSutherland said that the concern isn't just about one petition; it's about a culture of fear around civic engagement. \"If they got a few press hits out of it, scared a few voters that read [about] it, that would mean they won't sign a petition in the future for an amendment,\" she argued. That would be a win for DeSantis.\n\nA few weeks after voters were visited by police, the election crimes unit released a report accusing Floridians Protecting Freedom, a coalition working to pass Amendment 4, of \"widespread\" fraud and hit the organization with a fine of $328,000, which FPF has said it will contest.\n\nThe Office of Election Crimes and Security's late-stage report about the measure's signature drive launched more than a dozen lawsuits in courts around Florida, all of them shepherded by the same retired state Supreme Court justice, Alan Lawson. The effort is being underwritten by an unnamed \"angel financier,\" Lawson told the Miami Herald, and it asks judges to remove Amendment 4 from the ballot or invalidate it if it passes.\n\n\"There's no possible world where a judge somehow tries to keep it off the ballot at this stage,\" said law professor Michael Morley, director of Florida State University's Election Law Center, given that many people have already voted on Amendment 4. And while there's some precedent for courts invalidating a ballot measure after it passes, it's a high bar.\n\n\"It's not enough just to show there were mistakes,\" Morley said. \"For an after-the-fact challenge, it has to be systemic fraud.\"\n\nIn addition to the legal challenges, the DeSantis administration has funneled millions of dollars from at least six state agencies' budgets against the abortion and marijuana amendments. The state has racked up an estimated $19.3 million in bills, as documented in detail by Orlando-based investigative reporter Jason Garcia, based on recent contracts and purchase orders.\n\n\"We have never seen a governor direct state agencies to aggressively oppose a ballot measure that has qualified for the ballot,\" said Daniel Smith, a University of Florida political scientist who studies ballot initiatives.\n\nThe administration has spent much of this money on advertisements - and in doing so, is benefiting from an ambiguity in Florida law, according to Morley. There is a clear prohibition on local and county officials spending public funds on ads about ballot measures, and another law against state officers and employees using their titles and authority to weigh in on candidate elections.\n\n\"But for political appointees at the state level on ballot initiatives? That's a gray area,\" Morley said.\n\nThe governor is taking full advantage of that grayness to pump out advertisements and other materials opposing Amendment 4, both explicitly and in ads that defend the current ban without mentioning the ballot initiative. In one recent ad , which was sponsored by four state agencies, an anti-abortion doctor who was appointed by DeSantis to Florida's medical board tries to soften the state's ban, which is one of the strictest in the country.\n\nThe ad is part of a \"Florida Cares\" campaign spearheaded by the Agency for Health Care Administration, which set up a website that explicitly opposes Amendment 4 and decries its supporters as deceptive \"fearmongers.\" In September, AHCA took out TV and radio ads defending the current ban, then launched paid ads on Facebook and Instagram in early October. AHCA's social media ads on those platforms have been co-sponsored by the state departments of Children and Families, or DCF; Education; and Health.\n\nIn September, Floridians Protecting Freedom and the ACLU of Florida tried to challenge the legality of AHCA's media campaign, but a judge quickly tossed the lawsuit. In October, the Florida Supreme Court rejected a similar challenge.\n\nOther departments are running anti-marijuana ads, which are styled as public service announcements and were rolled out as early voting started on Amendment 3. On Monday, DCF posted one such ad to X, which was co-sponsored by the Department of Health. On October 23, DCF, with the backing of the Health and Education departments, started running one such ad on Facebook and Instagram. The three departments co-sponsored another ad that was posted online on October 20, and the state Department of Transportation put out its own in mid-October.\n\nLike AHCA, DCF has used its website and official social media presence to amplify DeSantis's campaign against the two ballot measures, including by sharing videos of the governor railing against the proposed amendments at press conferences.\n\n\"We could sit here and have an entire article on all of the things that the government could be spending that money on that we actually need in the third most populous state in the country.\"\n\nThe administration's ad blitz has laid bare the state's spending priorities. As Garcia reported , almost $3.9 million for recent DCF ads apparently came from the state's opioid settlement fund, which by law is meant for programs that curb the opioid epidemic . (DCF did not respond to The Intercept's questions about the ads or their funding source.)\n\n\"Honestly, we could sit here,\" Sutherland said, \"and have an entire article on all of the things that the government could be spending that money on that we actually need in the third most populous state in the country, and fighting to keep an abortion ban isn't one of them.\"\n\nIn addition to funding its own ad campaign, the DeSantis administration has also gone on the offensive against pro-Amendment 4 advertisements. In early October, the state Department of Health sent threatening letters to dozens of TV stations that carried a pro-Amendment 4 ad. The letter alleged that Floridians Protecting Freedom's advertisement posed a \"sanitary nuisance\" because it supposedly misrepresented the state's abortion ban. The Department of Health threatened the stations with criminal proceedings over the ad.\n\nThe amendment campaign sued to stop the DeSantis administration from blocking political speech through threats and the thin pretense of public health. It was in that litigation that the Department of Health's former top lawyer filed an affidavit revealing that DeSantis's closest legal advisers had drafted the letters without his input.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission condemned the letters, and a federal judge quickly ordered the DeSantis administration to stop using the state's legal apparatus to chill political speech. But Moody continued to defend the state's authority to send similar threats, and the health department signed contracts worth up to $1.4 million with two law firms to represent the state regarding \"false political advertisements.\" On Tuesday, the judge extended the temporary order until after Election Day.\n\nAshley \"AG\" Green, an organizer with Dream Defenders, a grassroots abolitionist organization in Florida, said DeSantis's anti-democratic tendencies have been apparent since he ran for governor six years ago. \"He's truly rigged the game at every level,\" Green said.\n\nBack in 2018, Green was working on the campaign to pass a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to the roughly 1.4 million Floridians with previous felony convictions.\n\nThen gubernatorial candidate DeSantis raged against the proposed amendment while campaigning against Democrat Andrew Gillum , making explicit his intentions to fight against its implementation. On election night, Green recalled a \"crushing sense\" that even though they'd won the fight to pass the amendment, DeSantis's victory would somehow taint it.\n\nAnd they were right. In 2019, the Republican-controlled state legislature began passing a series of laws dulling the effects of the constitutional amendment. On the regulatory side, DeSantis ignored calls from advocates to create a central database where \"returning citizens\" could easily check to make sure they'd paid off their fines and court fees, a prerequisite to voting, leaving them to navigate a labyrinth of different state and local court systems.\n\nThen came the election police. In 2022, DeSantis signed into existence the Office of Election Crimes and Security, a law enforcement body tasked with investigating election fraud and related crimes. Critics immediately sounded the alarm that the unit would be used to intimidate voters and create a culture of fear, particularly for the millions of newly enfranchised voters in the state who had no easy way to check their voting eligibility.\n\nEarly one morning in August 2022, Florida police raided the homes of 20 returning citizens for alleged voter fraud. Body camera footage would later reveal that many of the people arrested were shocked and confused, some having even received official documentation from the county about their eligibility. \"Voter fraud?\" exclaimed one of the women arrested, 55-year-old Romona Oliver. \"I voted, but I ain't commit no fraud.\"\n\nThe targeted voters were \"people who maybe hadn't voted in 20 or 30 years and are finally getting their rights restored, so excited to be able to vote again, only for the police to knock on their door,\" said Andrea Mercado, executive director of Florida Rising, a civic engagement organization in Florida. \"It seems very spiteful, but also focused on trying to create a climate of fear that if, you know, some fee somewhere hasn't been paid, that by voting they will risk being incarcerated.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe law creating the elections police is just one of several new statutes impacting the voting process. \"It is particularly egregious that many of these new laws disproportionately affect the voting rights of people of color,\" said Jonathan Webber, Florida policy director with the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nWebber pointed to Senate Bill 7050 , a 2023 law that imposed new \"bureaucratic\" regulations and financial penalties for community-based voter registration groups. \"Black and Hispanic voters are more dependent on these organizations than their white counterparts, making voter registration drives essential for their full participation in our democracy. Without these efforts, it is unclear how many eligible citizens will participate this year,\" he said. \"This situation is disheartening, anti-democratic, and completely unnecessary.\"\n\nThe threat to voter mobilization groups isn't hyperbole. In 2022, Green said her organization had to stop doing voter registration work after threats of legal action from DeSantis's election police. Despite attempts to restart their efforts in 2024, capacity issues and the legal risks \"felt pretty insurmountable,\" she said.\n\n\"All of the possible penalties that third-party voter registration organizations could potentially face for doing work they've done for decades, that's adding up to a really bad environment,\" concurred Leah Wong, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. \"These are just some of the things he's done to create an environment where people feel less empowered to vote.\"\n\nEskamani, who is up for reelection this year, said that despite the mountain of obstacles DeSantis has erected, it's imperative that people show up to vote anyway.\n\n\"If we don't win, and they're successful, it gives permission for so many other extremists, for so many other governors to do the same thing,\" she said. \"To use public money to campaign, to weaponize every state agency to pursue a political agenda.\"\n\nUpdate: October 29, 2024, 12:00 p.m. ET This article was updated to mention a new court order extending a temporary restraining order against the DeSantis administration until after Election Day.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Florida Abortion Amendment Falls Short Following Aggressive Opposition by Ron DeSantis\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe governor waged an unprecedented campaign to block Amendment 4, which needed 60 percent support to pass.\n\nIn the wake of an aggressive opposition campaign by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an effort to enshrine the right to a pre-viability abortion in the state constitution failed on Tuesday. The Republican governor threw the full weight of his administration behind blocking the measure, known as Amendment 4. A clear majority of voters backed the effort, but it fell just short of the 60 percent threshold it needed to pass.\n\nAddressing supporters just after 9 p.m., organizers with the Yes on 4! coalition struck a triumphant tone, emphasizing the 57 percent support the measure received. The results sent a clear message to legislators that the state's abortion ban is too extreme, an organizer said.\n\nThe amendment, which made its way onto the ballot with the support of 1 million Floridians, would have effectively invalidated the state's six-week abortion ban. The state's law, which DeSantis pushed through, effectively outlaws all abortions, because people often don't yet know they are pregnant at the six-week mark.\n\nFlorida voters also rejected Amendment 3, which would have legalized marijuana and had faced similar attacks from DeSantis.\n\nThe governor quickly took to social media to announce the results. He tweeted : \"With polls now closed in Florida - Amendment 3 has failed. Amendment 4 has failed.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, meanwhile, handily won the state for the third straight presidential election. Trump, who lives in Florida, on Tuesday refused to answer reporters' questions about how he voted on the amendment. The Republican nominee had previously criticized the state's six-week ban and suggested he would back the measure before reversing course.\n\nAcross the United States, voters in 10 states weighed in on reproductive rights, including in Missouri , which was the first state to officially outlaw abortion after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision .\n\nAs The Intercept previously reported , DeSantis's actions to undermine Amendment 4 showcased a troubling escalation in his larger efforts to subvert the direct democratic process in Florida and weaponize the administrative state.\n\nThe governor used the legal system, state agencies, the financial impact statement process, and the election cops in his quest to maintain the state's near-total abortion ban - spending millions of dollars in the process. The state reportedly spent roughly $4 million intended for fighting the opioid epidemic on advertisements against the two citizen-led amendments. Read Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nDeSantis went too far for even senior members of his administration. In October, John Wilson, the general counsel for Florida's Department of Health, resigned in protest after allegedly being directed by DeSantis to send cease-and-desist letters to television stations playing advertisements in favor of Amendment 4.\n\nPrior to Wilson's abrupt resignation, advocates had already been raising alarm bells over DeSantis's anti-democratic tactics.\n\nIn an interview ahead of the election, Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who won her reelection race on Tuesday, warned that if DeSantis was successful, it would set a dangerous precedent for other \"extremists\" to weaponize the administrative state against the electoral process.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "DeSantis Lawyer Can't Name a Single Policy That Led to Reform Prosecutor's Suspension\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn state Supreme Court, ousted DA Monique Worrell fought Gov. Ron DeSantis's attempt to turn Florida's justice system into a partisan cudgel.\n\nThe Florida Suprem e Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case about Gov. Ron DeSantis's suspension earlier this summer of an elected Florida district attorney over allegations that she neglected her duties. State Attorney Monique Worrell, the suspended municipal prosecutor in Orange and Osceola counties, petitioned the court to reinstate her.\n\nDuring the hearing, justices on the court vacillated between contradictory positions, arguing on the one hand that they weren't there to litigate the facts of DeSantis's claims against Worrell, and on the other suggesting that she neglected prosecutorial duties.\n\nAs part of his remaking of Florida's government, DeSantis has stacked the court with his allies and pressured it to enact his political agenda. For DeSantis, the court is yet another venue for expanding his authority and fanning the flames of a right-wing culture war by attacking criminal justice reform.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWorrell won election in 2020 with an overwhelming victory against a \"law-and-order\" opponent. She ran on addressing mass incarceration, restoring public trust in the office, and serving victims. DeSantis suspended Worrell in August, making her the second prosecutor he removed from office over political disagreements.\n\nThe attacks on prosecutors have far-reaching implications for the future of the criminal justice system and how state lawmakers exercise their authority and undermine the will of voters who elected reformers, Worrell's attorney Laura Ferguson said during the arguments.\n\n\"If a governor were able to remove a prosecutor of a different political party simply because they disagreed with their policies and categorize that as a neglect of duty or incompetence,\" Ferguson said, \"then that will have a substantial chilling effect on how state attorneys perform their roles or their willingness to serve.\"\n\nIn one exchange during the hearing, Ferguson said DeSantis's allegations that the district attorney had \"practices or policies\" to not prosecute certain categories of crimes were false and that she considered cases individually.\n\nJustice Charles Canady, whose wife is a DeSantis ally, interrupted Ferguson. \"That's not what's alleged though,\" Canady said. \"What's alleged, to kind of sum it up, is that she has policies that under-prosecute certain categories.\"\n\n\"The order infers and speculates about policies,\" Ferguson said in response.\n\n\"It makes assertions, it makes allegations,\" Canady replied. \"It doesn't have to prove it.\" He said a trial in the Florida Senate over Worrell's removal - on hold because of the Supreme Court challenge - would adjudicate those claims.\n\nThe attempt to remove elected prosecutors in Florida is part of a nationwide trend of Republicans looking to gain favor with the electorate through punitive, though potentially anti-democratic, policies. At least 17 states have launched similar efforts to curb the rise of reform-minded prosecutors who won office in increasing numbers since the mid-2010s.\n\nLast month, Georgia's Supreme Court blocked an effort by Republican lawmakers who sought to use a new state law to oust the prosecutor who indicted former President Donald Trump.\n\nPrior to winning the office, Worrell had worked under outgoing State Attorney Aramis Ayala . Ayala - a prosecutor who, like Worrell, is a Black woman - fell victim to the growing push to oust or limit the authority of elected reformers when former Florida Gov. Rick Scott removed her for refusing to seek the death penalty .\n\nMonique Worrell holds a press conference outside her former office in the Orange County Courthouse complex on Aug. 9, 2023, in Florida.\n\nDeSantis said he suspended Worrell for incompetence and \"neglecting her duty to faithfully prosecute crime.\" He appointed retired Judge Andrew Bain, a Federalist Society member, to replace her. A year earlier, DeSantis suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren after he said he would not charge people who sought abortions under the state's new abortion ban.\n\nThe suspensions are widely seen as part of DeSantis's effort to remake the state and its criminal justice system in his own image and to his political advantage - a remaking that extends all the way up to the Supreme Court . The conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo aided DeSantis's efforts on the courts by leading a secret panel of advisers to vet the judicial nominees before they take office.\n\nDeSantis has also worked to bring justices who took the bench prior to his term into his fold. Canady's wife, Jennifer, for instance, was elected last year to the Florida House. She has emerged as a close DeSantis ally in the legislature, co-sponsoring his signature six-week abortion ban. She is already in line to be the next speaker, with DeSantis's help.\n\nThe governor has also been accused of orchestrating a \"judicial gerrymander.\" His allies in the Florida House requested that the court consider a plan to redraw and consolidate judicial districts; the court created a commission to do so in June. Worrell's reelection chances, for example, would be severely impacted in a proposed redrawn district that waters down the progressive vote. The project would also advance DeSantis's political agenda: His office worked behind the scenes with police to tarnish the reputations of both Worrell and Warren, the Daily Beast reported .\n\nThe battle for the independence of the judiciary was on full display during Wednesday's hearing. Worrell's attorney argued that DeSantis had exceeded his constitutional authority in suspending her without specifying acts in which Worrell had neglected her prosecutorial duty.\n\nThe order does not list examples of policies that neglect prosecutorial duty, Ferguson argued: \"It just speculates that because she ran on a particular platform, she must have certain policies. They can't identify a single policy,\" she said. \"The order talks about how her office 'discourages,' which doesn't sound like a policy. It talks about 'practices,' but can't identify a single example.\"\n\nDeSantis's lawyer argued that Worrell's petition was not justiciable, meaning it referred to matters outside the court's jurisdiction.\n\nChief Justice Carlos Muñiz asked if the governor's office planned to specify policies and practices that proved neglect. DeSantis's lawyer said the governor's office had authority to remove a prosecutor if it could only show they weren't effective at prosecuting crime.\n\nWorrell's record on prison admission was \"abysmal,\" the DeSantis lawyer said. Even if she had no specific objectionable policies, such data would be grounds to remove her. \"If there was nothing specific she was doing, she just was just not effective at prosecuting crime, we think that that would be enough,\" he argued. But that was not a question for the high court to decide.\n\n\"It's remarkable that the governor's lead argument is that this court cannot review whether his order is constitutional,\" Ferguson said. \"This is a governor who has used his suspension order with great frequency and in an unprecedented way and targeted those of a different political party.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "State Lawyer Quits Over Ron DeSantis's Unconstitutional Attacks on Abortion Amendment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"A man is nothing without his conscience,\" the Florida health department's top lawyer wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis's close legal advisers ordered the Florida Department of Health to send unconstitutional threats regarding an abortion ballot measure, according to a federal court filing. Ordered to keep sending letters warning TV stations of criminal charges if they continued airing an advertisement promoting the abortion measure, the agency's top lawyer resigned in protest earlier this month, he wrote in an affidavit that was filed on Monday.\n\nJohn Wilson, the now former general counsel for the state Health Department, wrote in his affidavit that DeSantis's general counsel and his underlings drafted the letters and ordered Wilson to send them. \"I did not draft the letters or participate in any discussions about the letters prior to October 3,\" Wilson wrote .\n\nBy the time he resigned on October 10, the agency had sent threatening letters to approximately 50 stations around Florida. At least one station stopped running the ad, according to court filings.\n\nThe measure, Amendment 4, would amend the Florida Constitution so that the state legislature could not pass abortion bans or other restrictions before fetal viability. It would also prohibit bans that do not have exceptions for the health of the patient, as determined by their health care provider.\n\nThe affidavit was filed as part of a lawsuit brought by Amendment 4's sponsor, Floridians Protecting Freedom, over the threats to TV stations. The letters were just the latest drastic step DeSantis and other Florida officials have taken to oppose Amendment 4, including asking the Florida Supreme Court to keep it off the ballot entirely.\n\n\"This affidavit exposes state interference at the highest level,\" said Lauren Brenzel, Floridians Protecting Freedom's campaign director for Amendment 4. \"It's clear the State is hellbent on keeping Florida's unpopular, cruel abortion ban in place. Their extreme attacks on Amendment 4 are an anti-democratic tactic to keep Floridians from being able to make their own choice about whether Amendment 4 should become law.\"\n\nDeSantis's office and the state health department did not respond to questions about the lawsuit. The Intercept was not able to reach Wilson for comment.\n\nOn October 1, Floridians Protecting Freedom, started airing a TV advertisement featuring a Tampa woman, Caroline Williams. Williams needed an abortion 20 weeks into her pregnancy because of a brain tumor that required chemotherapy. She got an abortion in April 2022, weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.\n\nA Florida patient under similar circumstances today faces far more restrictions. Under a ban signed by DeSantis, which went into effect in May 2024, Florida prohibits abortions after six weeks unless two doctors certify that the procedure is necessary to \"save the pregnant woman's life or avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment.\"\n\n\"Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,\" Williams says in the advertisement. \"Amendment 4 is going to protect women like me.\" Read Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nTwo days after the \"Caroline\" advertisement first aired, on October 3, the Florida Department of Health sent letters to TV stations across Florida. So far, three of the dozens of stations that received a letter have been identified: WINK, a CBS affiliate in Fort Myers; WFLA, the NBC affiliate in Tampa; and WCJB, an ABC affiliate in Gainesville.\n\n\"The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,\" reads the letter, which was signed by Wilson. The letter alleged that the advertisement posed a \"sanitary nuisance\" because it misrepresented the state's abortion ban, and it threatened criminal proceedings against the stations. At least one of the stations, WINK, decided to stop running the ad after getting the letter, according to a court filing.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission quickly denounced the letter. \"Threats against broadcast stations for airing content that conflicts with the government's views are dangerous and undermine the fundamental principle of free speech,\" said FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement on October 8.\n\nFloridians Protecting Freedom sued the Florida surgeon general last week, claiming that the ad was accurate about the restrictions the current ban puts on doctors and patients like Williams. \"Under Florida's current law, I would not have provided this abortion because it could be viewed as a crime to terminate Caroline's pregnancy,\" a doctor wrote in an affidavit filed with the lawsuit. \"As the cancer was terminal, the abortion would not have saved the patient's life and therefore could be illegal under Florida law.\"\n\nFloridians Protecting Freedom also argued that the department's letters were an unconstitutional attempt to limit voter outreach for Amendment 4. In less than 48 hours, the federal court agreed that the state's letters were likely unconstitutional, rejecting the state's arguments to the contrary as \"Nonsense.\"\n\nMark E. Walker, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, ordered Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, to stop \"taking any further actions to coerce, threaten, or intimate repercussions\" against broadcasters who air the advertisement.\n\n\"To keep it simple for the State of Florida: it's the First Amendment, stupid,\" Walker wrote . \"The Surgeon General of Florida has the right to advocate for his own position on a ballot measure. But it would subvert the rule of law to permit the State to transform its own advocacy into the direct suppression of protected political speech.\"\n\nThe new filing from Wilson, the health department's former top attorney, makes clear that DeSantis's office orchestrated the letters, despite pushback from Wilson.\n\nIn his affidavit, Wilson claimed that Ryan Newman and Jed Doty, DeSantis's general counsel and deputy general counsel, gave him the orders to send the letters. A third attorney from the governor's office, assistant general counsel Sam Elliott, sent drafts of the letters to Wilson earlier on October 3, his affidavit claims.\n\nWilson resigned on October 10 \"in lieu of complying\" with directives from the governor's office to \"send out further correspondence to the media outlets,\" according to his affidavit.\n\n\"A man is nothing without his conscience,\" Wilson reportedly wrote in his resignation letter, according to the Miami Herald. \"It has become clear in recent days that I cannot join you on the road that lies before the agency.\"\n\nWilson's affidavit to the federal court also claims Newman ordered him to execute contracts for outside attorneys \"to be retained by the Department to assist with enforcement proceedings\" threatened in the letters to TV stations. The health department signed contracts worth up to $1.4 million with two law firms, according to purchasing documents filed as part of the lawsuit.\n\nAt a press conference on Monday, DeSantis criticized Amendment 4 as vague and extreme. The governor did not, however, address the fact that his office took unconstitutional steps to suppress ads supporting it.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Ron DeSantis's Next Ideological Coup: \"Judicial Gerrymander\" in Florida\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe governor's allies took the first steps toward moves that could upend the election of Democratic prosecutors and even judges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been slowly taking over the mechanisms of governance in the state by swapping out officials he doesn't like - even if they were elected by voters - and replacing them with people who will bend to his will.\n\nLately, DeSantis has set his sights on the justice system. Earlier this month, he removed an elected prosecutor from office over a political disagreement - the second he has taken out. State Attorney for Orange-Osceola counties Monique Worrell, the governor claimed, hadn't pursued the charges he wanted. A year earlier, he suspended former Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren, who had said he wouldn't criminally charge people who sought abortion care under Florida's latest abortion ban.\n\nNow, Florida is opening a new front in the battle between state politicians and elected stewards of the law, taking the first steps to launch what could become an ideological gerrymandering of the justice system. In Florida, 20 circuit courts serve two main purposes: as regional courts for certain types of cases, as well as appeals courts for the smaller county court systems. DeSantis's allies are seeking to remake those circuit districts.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOn June 30, the Florida Supreme Court, which oversees the circuit courts, created a new commission to review the judicial circuits. The commission was created after a request from Republican state House Speaker Paul Renner, who had written a June 15 letter to the court asking that it review judicial circuits to account for recent demographic shifts and consider consolidating them.\n\n\"This is judicial gerrymandering, plain and simple,\" said Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani. Eskamani represents the district where Worrell was elected and is running for reelection next year.\n\n\"If you consolidate the circuits, Monique Worrell will not be reelected. And that's a 100 percent what their plan is,\" Eskamani said. \"The intent is to create these larger circuits that water down the vote of the more progressive areas.\"\n\nThe commission launched against the backdrop of a national effort to limit or void the authority of elected prosecutors in more than 15 states. Its commission's decisions could impact judges and elected state attorneys, public defenders, and circuit clerks. Authorized by a Supreme Court dominated by DeSantis appointees and Federalist Society members, the commission creates a new way for the DeSantis administration to remove elected officials it might disagree with.\n\nComparing DeSantis's push to efforts in other states to restrict the authority of prosecutors, Eskamani said, \"This is out of that same exact playbook.\"\n\nIf the commission's review process results in redrawn maps, circuit judges could also face challenges to their reelection efforts, said Neil Skene, a legal historian who wrote a history of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nSkene said that \"the likely approach will be to add one or more 'red' counties to the major 'blue' counties like Hillsborough and Orange and perhaps Jacksonville and Tallahassee.\"\n\nThe move by the court to review judicial circuits comes just over a year after state lawmakers approved salary increases for circuit court judges and state Supreme Court justices, budgeting $50 million for the newly created Sixth District Court of Appeal.\n\nThe salary bumps included in the package are raising a question about the Supreme Court's motives for creating the commission. \"There is something of a tradition where the legislature and the court system engage in this sort of - I won't call it an exchange of favors, but in appreciation for one thing, they will sort of identify a thing that will be important to the other and do it,\" he said. \"I do something nice for you, and you might do something nice for me one day. That's what happens.\"\n\nThe commission plans to hold seven meetings, including two public hearings, and expects to submit a final report by December 1 on whether or not there is a need to consolidate judicial circuits. The commission has held two meetings since July, and its first public hearing is scheduled Friday at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando.\n\nThe state Supreme Court will receive the committee's findings and could include any nonbinding recommendation in its annual certification opinion, which is submitted to the legislature. \"The legislature regularly exercises its authority to set and fund judge positions in ways that differ from the Supreme Court's opinion,\" court spokesperson Paul Flemming told The Intercept.\n\nDuring the commission's first meeting in July, Supreme Court Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz said there was no preconceived outcome; he encouraged commission members to keep an open mind throughout the process.\n\nThroughout July and August, at least 25 state attorneys and judges submitted feedback to the commission. The Florida Bar sent a survey to members on August 10 asking for feedback on existing circuits. Several raised concerns with the idea of consolidating districts and said such changes could undermine community ties and public trust.\n\n\"We are proud of our communities and choose to live in small towns for a reason,\" wrote Third Judicial Circuit State Attorney John Durrett. \"To tether or consume us within another Circuit, headquartered within an urban center hundreds of miles away, would only serve to create a sense of detachment and neglect,\" he said. \"Consolidation would not develop trust. It would undermine it.\"\n\n\"I believe that re-aligning or consolidating Florida's judicial circuits would be very disruptive to our law enforcement and our criminal justice systems,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle wrote. \"Like education, law enforcement is, and should be, local and reflect community values; judicial circuit consolidation would serve neither of those two ideals.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, waves prior to a joint session for Gov. Ron DeSantis's State of the State speech on March 7, 2023, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks passed between when Renner, the Republican House speaker, first sent his letter to the court and when Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz issued the order to create the commission. The process was atypically swift.\n\nRenner sent the letter after the state legislative session ended. There had not been a broader discussion about circuits during the session, said Eskamani, the Democratic representative, and the speed of the commission's creation was unusual.\n\nSomething like Renner's letter or the court's proposal often comes at the end of a process, not the beginning, Skene said.\n\n\"You're not gonna get an immediate response to a ridiculously obscure proposal like restructuring the court system. That just has no political appeal. But what does have political appeal: if we redraw these lines in a way that gets more Republicans and fewer Democrats elected,\" he said. \"Having somebody see the political opportunity in a relatively routine governance issue always helps move things very quickly.\"\n\nThe speed at which the court moved to create the commission after Renner sent his letter undermines the idea of three branches of government serving as checks on each other, Eskamani said. \"To see that letter and also just how fast things moved, clearly there's some sort of coordination here,\" she said. \"The commission was formed incredibly fast. They've already convened and now they're coming to Orlando.\"\n\nIn response to questions about the timing of the commission's creation, Flemming, the court spokesperson, said Muñiz's administrative order spoke for itself. \"Such an assessment is contemplated in the Court's rules, where an annual assessment is allowed, as specified in the administrative order,\" Flemming said. He added that the timing of the committee's work is directed in part by the early start of the 2024 legislative session, which begins during January in even-numbered years.\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Renner cited Florida's population growth since the last review in 1969 and the desire to cut costs through consolidation. \"This request for review is a responsible, first step to understanding whether we can optimize our court system to best serve Floridians in the 21st Century,\" Renner said. (DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFor judges, a seat on the circuit courts can be seen as an audition for higher appointment by the governor, Skene said. \"Now it's much more a patronage-driven process,\" he said. \"This is another step in the partisan-izing of the court system. That's the big concern. And obviously, what you want is judges who are not gonna rule based on whether they like your politics.\"\n\nDeSantis has already reshaped the court system by appointing ideological allies, Eskamani said, and the commission could create opportunities for him to expand that network. \"We already see this erosion of our judicial system based on the lack of merit-based decision-making. And then this, on top of it - it's purely political.\"\n\n\"The most clear, obvious result of this is going to be circuits that are not going to elect Democratic public defenders, or Democratic state attorneys, or Democratic anyone,\" Eskamani said. \"It's absolutely a tool to weaken the power of voters.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Has Raked in $3.9 Million From Insurance Industry, New Report Reveals\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe governor has overseen a dramatic rise in home insurance premiums and legislative giveaways to insurance companies.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his political action committee have received millions of dollars from insurance stakeholders as he has overseen massive giveaways to the insurance industry, according to a new report . Florida homeowners, meanwhile, face ballooning insurance prices and are under increasing economic strain in one of the states hardest hit by climate change.\n\nThe governor's committee and the Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC raked in $3.9 million from the insurance industry since its formation in 2018, according to a report released Wednesday by Hedge Clippers, a campaign organized by the Center for Popular Democracy, \"including more than $150,000 in one day from dozens of State Farm agents.\" The governor's inaugural fund was also backed by a combined $125,000 from two property casualty insurers, People's Trust Insurance and a subsidiary of Heritage Insurance.\n\n\"DeSantis is not only failing to hold the insurance industry accountable,\" reads the report. \"Critically, he is failing to bring down rates for Florida homeowners.\" The American Federation of Teachers and Florida Rising, a grassroots voting rights and organizing group, also contributed to the report, titled \"How Ron DeSantis Sold Out Florida Homeowners.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe new analysis is based on a review of Florida Department of State campaign finance records, aggregating donors to DeSantis's PAC who reported employment in the insurance industry from January 2018 to December 2022. The report also used the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation to assess insurance rate hikes since DeSantis took office.\n\nThe Intercept's review of the campaign finance records reveals that the following insurance providers made five-figure contributions to the PAC during that time period: National General Management Corp., Allstate, Progressive, and American Integrity Insurance.\n\nUnder DeSantis's watch, home insurance premiums have risen from $1,988 to $4,231 on average, putting Floridians under financial strain to pay for insurance that sits at nearly three times the national average. And this year, home insurance premiums are expected to increase another 40 percent , an issue that former President Donald Trump has hammered DeSantis over as the governor weighs a challenge to Trump in the GOP presidential primary.\n\n\"Ron DeSanctimonious is delivering the biggest insurance company BAILOUT to Globalist Insurance Companies, IN HISTORY,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social in March.\n\nThese increases come as DeSantis has rubber-stamped policies accelerating insurance company profits at direct cost to homeowners and Florida taxpayers broadly.\n\nDuring a special legislative session in May 2022, lawmakers approved a $2 billion reinsurance fund, which is insurance for insurance providers that is typically purchased on the open market. The taxpayer-funded reserve was justified as a way to protect insurers from bankruptcy in the event of a cataclysmic event while simultaneously lowering insurance costs for consumers. Despite those promises , insurance premiums have remained exorbitantly high, with rate increases outpacing savings derived from the fund.\n\n\"The $2 billion giveaway program, which used taxpayer funds to subsidize industry risks, was called 'Reinsurance to Assist Policyholders,' but there is little evidence that it lived up to its name.\" the report states. \"Costs for policyholders rose after the passage of the taxpayer-funded subsidy.\"\n\nSeven months after the reinsurance fund was established, DeSantis signed another piece of legislation similarly rushed through a special session to gut litigants' ability to collect legal fees from insurance providers refusing to pay out claims. The new law shields insurance companies from massive liability for blocking insurance claims, while simultaneously disincentivizing homeowners from pursuing claims in the first place.\n\n\"The issues in Florida's property insurance market did not occur overnight, and they will not be solved overnight,\" DeSantis said at the bill signing in December. \"The historic reforms signed today create an environment which realigns Florida to best practices across the nation, adding much-needed stability to Florida's market, promoting competition, and increasing consumer choice. I am thankful the legislature answered the call for meaningful reform.\"\n\nThe report points out that DeSantis could have taken another path: \"When insurers threatened to pull out of the state and massively hike rates following Hurricane Andrew, then-Governor Lawton Chiles devised a solution that included a freeze on rate increases,\" the authors note. Meanwhile, states like Louisiana, Alabama, and California have formulated their own effective plans for keeping insurance costs low through a combination of insurance provider-funded grants and insurance premium discounts for homeowners who improve the resilience of their homes in climate-affected areas.\n\nFor some Florida residents, the exorbitant cost of insurance means choosing to live without coverage and risking potential damage from a storm or natural disaster. Tracy Brown, a community liaison specialist at Miami-Dade County Public Schools, was forced to discontinue her home insurance after the premium payments jumped to $1,800 per month in April 2021. \"Our governor needs to know that the cost of living we had three years ago is not what we have now.\" Brown told The Intercept. \"For a middle-class person to live effectively, the cost of living has to be lower to live a life and not just live paycheck to paycheck.\" On Easter Sunday of this year, Brown lost her home to a fire.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "DeSantis Stacked Florida's Supreme Court With Cronies Who Wage His War on Wokeness - or Else\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOf all the flunkies Gov. Ron DeSantis installed across the state, the longest lasting effects will come from his total takeover of Florida's Supreme Court.\n\nShortly after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took office in 2019, the state Supreme Court threatened to dissolve the Florida Bar Association if it didn't get rid of its diversity programs.\n\nThe court had taken a sharp right turn after DeSantis selected three new justices with the help of Federalist Society board co-chair Leonard Leo . Leo led a secret panel of advisers that vetted DeSantis's judicial nominees before he took office.\n\nThe revelation came on the heels of a slew of news stories on conservative donors buying influence on the U.S. Supreme Court - where Leo, again, was among the conservative legal activists who helped to install a conservative majority. The top federal court has since made landmark rulings against abortion rights and in favor of business interests . And Leo isn't done yet: He funnels money to a network of right-wing organizations orchestrating key Supreme Court cases on red-meat conservative issues.\n\nIn Florida, Leo was working to overturn a 40-year status quo of judiciary balance and restraint. The state Supreme Court had fostered an image of independence after corruption scandals that forced two justices to resign in the early 1970s. When DeSantis took office, concerns about improprieties disappeared. The governor has a long history with the Federalist Society - he was a member at Harvard Law School - and his judicial nominees are backed by the group.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe ideological project DeSantis is pushing Florida is no secret. He unabashedly appoints political allies to posts across the state . Such picks have shown up in the judiciary, nonpartisan election offices , and state boards that oversee public schools and colleges, medical practices , business, and real estate.\n\nDeSantis's appointments, budget decisions , and fundraising tactics have come under heightened scrutiny since he announced a presidential run last month. None of the appointments, however, eclipse the lasting change of his state Supreme Court takeover. DeSantis has named five of the court's seven members, all of whom are members of the Federalist Society.\n\n\"I don't think he's appointing chumps, but he's clearly put a more ideological litmus test on his justices than others have,\" said Neil Skene, who published an official history of the court. Vetting justices by patronage was common starting under President George Bush in the early 2000s, Skene said, but DeSantis is at the vanguard of making purely ideological appointments.\n\nLeonard Leo speaks at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. on April 23, 2019.\n\nHe is not the first to award contracts to donors or administrative posts to political operatives, but DeSantis does it at an unprecedented scale . The thoroughness of his cronyism has had a chilling effect in Florida: There is a perception among politicians and residents alike that nothing can get done if you're seen a DeSantis foe, said Barbara Petersen, executive director of the Florida Center for Government Accountability.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" Petersen said. Public servants are dismayed at what's happening to their state, she said: \"People are afraid of him.\"\n\nAfter the scandals in the 1970s, successive Florida governors sought to improve the diversity of viewpoints on the state Supreme Court.\n\n\"The idea behind all of that, of course, is to make sure that all of Florida is represented on its highest court,\" said Craig Waters, who worked at the court for 35 years and was its communications director until he retired last year. \"It makes sure that a state Supreme Court does not become an echo chamber, but a true debate society. If you have members of a state Supreme Court that are careful of each other and watching each other, it prevents anything happening that might lend itself to a lack of public trust and confidence. It's very important that the justices police each other.\"\n\nThat stopped under DeSantis.\n\n\"What I see today,\" Waters said, \"is a court that lacks diversity and that lacks that internal policing mechanism that has served it so well in the past.\"\n\nShortly after DeSantis made his first appointments, the court started chipping away at its diversity programs.\n\nIn 1949, the state Supreme Court founded the Florida Bar, an association that regulates attorneys. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the bar sought to diversify the judiciary along ideological, ethnic, and gender lines and to address judicial discrimination. The association convened a diversity symposium in 2004 and issued a report with recommendations to help improve diversity and strengthen its independence. In 2010, the Florida Bar created a committee to address diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhen DeSantis's allies arrived on the court, threats began coming down: The bar would be dissolved if it didn't get rid of its diversity initiatives. Soon enough, the attacks proved effective. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ordered that the bar association amend its continuing legal education, or CLE, policy and eliminate a requirement for diversity among speakers and panelists in its continuing educational programs. The fight even made its way to the American Bar Association , which changed its own policies in April 2022 to bring the group into compliance with the rules imposed on the Florida Bar.\n\nFlorida Bar spokesperson Jennifer Krell Davis told The Intercept that the association had not changed its diversity programs, but that it adhered with the court's order to eliminate diversity requirements in CLE programs. She declined to comment on a question about the court's alleged threat to dissolve the association. \"Our Leadership Academy, Path to Unity and Diversity grant programs (and others) continue to thrive under our Diversity and Inclusion committee,\" Krell Davis said.\n\nIn February, the state Supreme Court went so far to dissolve the court system's Standing Committee on Fairness and Diversity and eliminate its fairness and diversity training for judges.\n\nThe court's public information Director Paul Flemming said the court's opinion was self-explanatory. \"The opinions of the Florida Supreme Court speak for themselves,\" Flemming said. \"I would refer you to what is written there: 'Quotas based on characteristics like the ones in this policy are antithetical to basic American principles of nondiscrimination.'\"\n\nHow the state Supreme Court arrived here is the story of DeSantis's picks. The court's current chief justice, Carlos Muñiz, took an unusual path to the bench. He had previously been a Republican political operative and worked in the Trump administration as general counsel to former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Muñiz was deputy attorney general and chief of staff to former Attorney General Pam Bondi, deputy chief of staff and general counsel to the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, and deputy general counsel to former Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nMost Read Trump Administration Texted College Professors' Personal Phones to Ask If They're Jewish Akela Lacy After Tucker Carlson Guest Attacked a Defense Advisory Board, the Pentagon Nuked Its Website Matt Sledge Pentagon Insiders on Hegseth Leak Hypocrisy: \"Full On Shit Show\" Nick Turse Most Read Trump Administration Texted College Professors' Personal Phones to Ask If They're Jewish Akela Lacy After Tucker Carlson Guest Attacked a Defense Advisory Board, the Pentagon Nuked Its Website Matt Sledge Pentagon Insiders on Hegseth Leak Hypocrisy: \"Full On Shit Show\" Nick Turse\n\nWhen DeSantis took office, Alan Lawson, a conservative and the most senior judge on the bench, was in line to be the next chief justice of the court. Court staff had been preparing for his ascension and budgeting for his administration when Lawson abruptly announced in April 2022 that he would retire. Lawson went to work as a partner at a new law firm in Tallahassee run by Republican political operatives who had broken off from one of the state's top GOP law firms, Shutts & Bowen. Lawson told the Washington Post his decision to leave court was purely personal.\n\nThat July, less than four years after he was appointed to the state Supreme Court, Muñiz became its chief. Lawson was the first justice to be passed over for chief despite his seniority since 1976, said Skene, the expert on Florida courts. \"He was not of the solidly Federalist Society group and Muñiz was,\" he said. \"Muñiz had a much more political job before that.\"\n\nAnother DeSantis pick, Renatha Francis, worked at Shutts & Bowen before she was appointed to the court in 2020. Her original nomination was nullified because she hadn't been a member of the bar for 10 years, as required by the state constitution. She was nominated again in 2022.\n\nThe web of allies and appointments DeSantis has woven across the state overlaps with and influences the court. In May, after another justice abruptly stepped down to take a job at a DeSantis-linked insurance company, the governor appointed Meredith Sasso to the state Supreme Court. Several months before, DeSantis had appointed her husband, Mike Sasso, to the board of the former Reedy Creek Improvement District, where the governor has been embroiled in a battle with Disney . DeSantis appointed Sasso and four other Republicans to the board in February, including a major GOP donor and a co-founder of the far-right group Moms for Liberty who is married to the chair of Florida's GOP.\n\nFour days after Meredith Sasso joined the bench, her husband resigned from the improvement district board. Had Sasso remained on, it would have raised questions about his wife's ability to participate in court decisions related to Disney without presenting a conflict of interest.\n\nSimilar questions may soon face Charles Canady, another justice who was appointed by former Democratic Gov. Charlie Crist. Canady's wife Jennifer was elected last year to the Florida state House and quickly co-sponsored a bill that would ban abortion beyond six weeks. DeSantis signed the six-week ban into law in April, but its implementation is pending an ongoing court challenge to the state's current 15-week ban. Jennifer Canady has been floated as the state's next speaker of the House with DeSantis's blessing.\n\n\"That poses a really difficult kind of situation for Canady because basically every law that gets passed and might be up for court review will come through the House of Representatives,\" Skene said. \"It certainly creates this interesting proposition where husband and wife might be at the head of two different branches of government.\"\n\nWhat makes DeSantis different from his predecessors is that his actions are overtly political, said Ben Wilcox, research director and co-founder of Integrity Florida, a government watchdog. DeSantis has reshaped Florida politics far beyond the judiciary, from the boards of public schools to boards of medicine .\n\n\"Because DeSantis has such an aggressive agenda, that's why you're seeing all these appointments to school boards, universities,\" Wilcox said. \"He's really trying to push his agenda in pretty much every chance he has.\"\n\nThe governor, for instance, overhauled the board of trustees at the New College of Florida and installed conservative activists. One pick to the board was the architect of the war on critical race theory. The new board quickly fired the college president and replaced her with the former Republican speaker of the Florida House. He, in turn, tapped a GOP lawmaker - whom his office had previously suspended from a county position after he was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer - to become the next president of South Florida State College.\n\nThe lawmaker, state Rep. Fred Hawkins, had no higher education experience, and the school lowered the education requirements for the position just three days before he submitted his application. Three finalist candidates withdrew their applications after the governor's office contacted members of the board, the Herald Advocate reported . Hawkins got the job.\n\nHawkins would prove to be yet another loop in the tangle of DeSantis cronies. Before arriving at South Florida State, Hawkins sponsored a bill that gave DeSantis power to appoint the board for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, where Disney is based. The move came just under a year after DeSantis signed a bill to revoke Disney's special tax status after the entertainment giant publicly opposed his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill. Disney sued DeSantis in April, claiming the governor weaponized the state government to retaliate against it for making First Amendment-protected speech.\n\nDeSantis also stacked the state's two medical boards , including an appointment for a real estate broker whose wife DeSantis had installed in a real estate appraisal board. Both medical boards voted last year to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.\n\nDeSantis repeatedly leveraged his position to bully Florida political figures - from elected officials to lobbyists in the state - into supporting his ambitions and pet causes.\n\n\"What he is doing, and what is now being reported, is his shakedown of lobbyists,\" said Petersen, of the Florida Center for Government Accountability.\n\nDeSantis's chief of staff organized government officials to solicit campaign contributions from lobbyists, NBC reported earlier this month.\n\n\"Shaking down legislators, you know: 'Give me your endorsement, I haven't signed the budget yet,'\" Petersen said. \"And damned if he did not retaliate against those people. You can see it in the vetoes. It's stunning.\"\n\nThe governor's allies have also gone on to enrich themselves. In September 2020, shortly after former Florida Republican House Majority Leader Dane Eagle lost in the Republican congressional primary for a U.S. House seat, DeSantis gave him a new job . Eagle, a commercial real estate broker, was appointed as the executive director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. In January, less than two and a half years into the job, Eagle announced that he would join the government affairs team at Ballard Partners, one of Florida's biggest international lobbying firms, with extensive ties to Donald Trump.\n\n\"DeSantis continues to use his political position as Governor to feed the grift of his allies, by gifting them positions their unqualified for, allowing contracts to be diverted towards friendly vendors and pleasing donors with bills that he signs into law,\" said Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who represents parts of Orlando, in a text message. \"It's unethical and feeds into people's distrust of the Governor.\"\n\nWith DeSantis's budget for 2023 to 2024, critics saw a governor intent on funding his top causes at the expense of Floridians' real concerns. DeSantis cut funding for projects to protect public lands and prevent flooding that were pushed by Democrats and Republican lawmakers who resisted his requests for endorsements in the presidential primary.\n\n\"It's becoming more and more clear as all of this information is coming out that what he's doing, he's doing for the sole purpose of his political ambition - and to the detriment of Floridians,\" said Petersen. \"We've got real problems in Florida.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "DeSantis Still Can't Find Enough Employees for His Voter Fraud Crackdown\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Florida governor created a new office for prosecuting election crimes - but no one wants to work there.\n\nWhen Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis first announced a new unit to investigate alleged voter fraud in the state, he painted a picture of a sweeping police agency with more than 50 positions and unprecedented authority. Over one year later, the Office of Election Crimes and Security has struggled to staff up - even as the legislature recently increased its budget. Seven of the office's 18 positions remain vacant according to a July organizational chart provided to The Intercept through a public records request.\n\nDeSantis created the unit in April 2022 amid a broader Republican push to sow distrust in the electoral system by spreading false claims of voter fraud. But since its inception, the office has consistently fallen short of its staffing goals. An ABC affiliate reported that only three of 15 positions had been filled by January.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe current vacant roles include a senior attorney, assistant director, and four government operations consultants. The office is also hiring for a program director, after Republican political operative Brooke Renney vacated the position less than a year after she was hired. Florida Department of State spokesperson Natalie Meiner said Renney completed her assignments and took a job in the Department of State's information technology division. She added that the office is currently advertising positions but did not clarify if the department still hopes to achieve its previously stated personnel numbers.\n\nPeople are reluctant to join the office because there's a public sense that it's unnecessary, said Cecile M. Scoon, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. State attorneys and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement previously handled cases of alleged voter fraud, which remain exceedingly rare. \"The way it was presented would make most reasonable and rational people hesitate to be a part of that,\" Scoon said.\n\nThe unit has also drawn criticism from voting rights advocates, who say it is an attempt to discourage people of color from casting their ballots .\n\n\"This office was created in a partisan attempt to further unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud, a claim often used to attack ballot access of Black and brown voters,\" said Estee Konor, associate director of litigation at Demos, a think tank that works on issues related to racial justice. \"Qualified people - regardless of political affiliation - do not want to be affiliated with fringe conspiracies about our elections.\"\n\nThe Office of Election Crimes and Security announced its first major set of arrests last August, when 20 people were charged with third-degree felonies for voting in the 2020 election, despite having disqualifying felony convictions. Many of those arrested said they had received their voter registration cards and thought they were eligible to vote.\n\nThe defendants - more than half of whom were Black - faced up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. At least seven cases have resulted in convictions, and four were dismissed because of jurisdictional issues, though the state has appealed several of the court orders. In February, lawmakers passed a law attempting to circumvent those jurisdictional issues. At least 11 of the cases remain open, pending, or in appeal.\n\nSome of voters' confusion stemmed from the legislative battle over a 2018 Florida ballot referendum , which had restored voting rights to people with felony convictions after they completed parole or probation. The measure would not have applied to those arrested last August, as it excluded people convicted of murder or a felony sex offense and was largely gutted by Republicans in 2019. Nevertheless, an attorney for one woman said she thought the law included her.\n\n\"You put SWAT teams out with helicopters to arrest grandfathers? Pull them out with their pajamas, don't even let them get dressed?\" Scoon said. \"That was ugly. That was harsh and totally unnecessary. And then you find out many of these people were told by state authorities that they could vote. That doesn't put a very good taste in your mouth.\"\n\nThe state hasn't shown the same aggression toward everyone it's charged with voting-related crimes, Scoon said. At least four residents in The Villages, a retirement community in central Florida that is a Republican stronghold , were also arrested and charged with voter fraud in 2021. The cases were resolved in pretrial intervention deals. One defendant took a civics class and did community service to avoid a public record of the arrest or charges. All of the Villages residents arrested for voter fraud are white.\n\n\"These same prosecutors went to the heavily-Republican villages and made plea deals with several more conservative citizens,\" Scoon said. \"Nobody was dragged out in their pajamas and humiliated. Those that are aware of these discrepancies, honestly, who wants to be a part of that?\"\n\nA total of at least 26 people have been arrested for voting offenses as of January, according to a report from the election crimes office. The office received more than 2,000 complaints and shared information with law enforcement for the criminal investigation of roughly 1,100 people - a mere fraction of the 11.1 million Floridians who voted in the 2020 election alone.\n\nIn May, Florida lawmakers increased the Office of Election Crimes and Security's budget from $1.1 million to $1.4 million. That money could be spent on other critical issues in Florida, Scoon noted. \"We know that schools don't have nurses, we know that places are dilapidated, state hospitals are missing staff,\" she said. \"There are real needs in our state.\"\n\nScoon added that's part of why the office hasn't filled its roster. \"You want to be useful in life, and life's short.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Is All In-on Creating an American Autocracy\n\nKelsey Dake\n\nPema Levy July+August 2023 Issue\n\n\"Our government is a government of laws, not a government of men,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared last August, standing at a podium in Tampa with a phalanx of armed officers behind him. \"That means that we govern ourselves based on a constitutional system.\" The occasion was a triumphant press conference announcing his suspension of Andrew Warren, an elected county prosecutor who, DeSantis alleged, had put himself above the law after the Supreme Court rolled back abortion rights by signing a pledge not to prosecute related cases. That evening, DeSantis appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to squeeze every ounce of publicity out of the affair. \"There's a lot of line prosecutors in that office that are very happy that this was done,\" DeSantis boasted. \"We took it seriously, we did a thorough review, and we pulled the trigger today.\"\n\nDeSantis, in his telling, had removed a tyrant to benefit the less powerful. But what happened is a stark example of the opposite: an autocratic governor overturning the will of the people to punish his enemies for political gain. It was DeSantis who had placed himself above the law.\n\nFor more articles read aloud: download the Audm iPhone app .\n\nA federal judge later found Warren's ouster to be unconstitutional, and though he declined to reinstate him on a technicality, trial testimony and documents revealed a much different story than the one DeSantis told. Though DeSantis had claimed otherwise, his administration barely reviewed Warren's record, and it did not bother to consult with Warren's staff. Instead, evidence suggested that DeSantis sought to capitalize on the right's obsession with reform-minded prosecutors (who aim to roll back overzealous prosecution and mass incarceration) by making an example of one. He tasked an aide with finding a worthwhile target and that staffer zeroed in on Warren, crafting a removal announcement that mentioned billionaire George Soros, even though he had not funded Warren's campaigns. If there was any doubt about the real purpose of Warren's removal, records unearthed in the case showed that the governor's staff dutifully tallied the value of the free coverage they had generated from this made-for-TV stunt: $2.4 million.\n\nOther Republicans have sought to oust reform prosecutors through recall elections or to strip some of their authority legislatively. But DeSantis escalated those tactics, opting to remove Warren himself-and do so illegally. The episode showcased DeSantis' disregard for the democratic process, his use of the state to punish political opponents, and his mission to install loyal allies across positions of power. While Donald Trump shares these authoritarian tendencies, DeSantis is much more methodical, though no less ruthless. Trump's appeal relied on charisma, but DeSantis compensates for his lack of it with staged attacks and appearances that score points with GOP voters.\n\nDeSantis has proven his \"willingness to routinely use the machinery of the state to punish rivals,\" explains Harvard government professor Steven Levitsky . \"That's authoritarianism at its core. That's what authoritarians do.\"\n\nWarren is continuing to fight being stripped of his office in state and federal court. \"This is about far more than my position,\" he says. \"If the governor can just remove an elected official from office, on a whim, without any legal basis, then it nullifies the meaning of democracy across our state. It means that elections have no meaning.\"\n\nWarren is not the only local elected official DeSantis has targeted. He's booted school board members , an election supervisor , and a sheriff -all Democrats. DeSantis has turned the power of the state against political opponents, businesses that transgress his orthodoxy, and the education system and universities that serve as liberal bulwarks against illiberal rulers. DeSantis breeds fear of vulnerable groups for political advantage. As part of this politics of reprisal, he is imposing a uniform ideology upon Florida: anti-queer, anti-Black, anti-immigrant, and patriarchal, through laws banning discussion of gender identity, systemic racism, and sexism. The \"Free State of Florida,\" he likes to say, \"is where woke goes to die.\" But his rhetoric scrambles reality. In fact, DeSantis has stoked a fear of wokeism to strip freedoms and amass power.\n\nTo stifle dissent, in 2021 DeSantis signed a law that would ramp up penalties for rioting but that civil rights groups warned would ensnare peaceful protesters; this spring he pushed legislation to unleash speech-­chilling lawsuits against news outlets.\n\n\"One of the strategies that DeSantis and the right wing deploy is trying to make things appear to be individual fires burning, so you can't find a way to put out the source of the blaze,\" says Brandon Wolf, the press secretary for Equality Florida, a LGBTQ rights organization. But what connects each conflagration is \"a belief that freedom is designed for some people, not all people. It's a belief that democracy is not an institution worth defending, but rather an obstacle.\"\n\nDeSantis, like other distrustful autocrats, keeps a tight circle of advisers, including his wife. And he goes through staff \"like Sherman through Georgia,\" says Mac Stipanovich, a veteran Florida Republican operative. In their book How Democracies Die , Levitsky and his colleague Daniel Ziblatt explain that authoritarians augment their power by capturing the referees-the press, the judiciary, the legislature-and then rewriting the rules. DeSantis has followed this playbook. \"He has assiduously worked to transform the judiciary in Florida,\" notes Stipanovich, a Never Trumper who left the GOP in 2018. \"He pushes to the very limit, and then beyond the executive powers of the office.\"\n\nEven in the face of court rulings assailing his initiatives, DeSantis' spokesperson insists the governor acts within constitutional lines. DeSantis calls his agenda the \"Florida blueprint,\" and it's no secret that he dreams of replicating his authoritarian experiment at the national level. But even if DeSantis doesn't become the GOP's 2024 presidential nominee, he has already demonstrated that further abandoning democratic norms can bring great success in the Republican Party. His governing style is the logical evolution of Trumpism, from a chaotic politics of reprisal to a calculated system of repression and power-grabbing. \"This really is what's coming to the country,\" says Anders Croy, communications director at Florida Watch, a progressive group. \"Florida, essentially, is a laboratory of authoritarianism right now.\"\n\nIn 2018, DeSantis squeaked into office by 32,000 votes, and early in his tenure he struck a relatively moderate note. But the coronavirus pandemic presented an opportunity to stand out and take control. He invoked emergency powers to dole out more than $5 billion in federal relief without oversight, and canceled meetings of Florida's Cabinet, a group of four statewide elected officials who jointly oversee a dozen agencies.\n\nDeSantis' fight to end mask mandates and reopen the state made him a right-wing hero. And as the pandemic receded, he pivoted to a new conservative crusade that held the potential to allow him to outflank Trump on the right and sustain his own rise: the supposed indoctrination of schoolchildren by liberal educators. Fueled by near-constant Fox News appearances, he cemented his popularity with conservatives and attracted billionaire donors, who view him as Trump's most viable successor and stuffed his reelection coffers with millions. As he became a national figure, he leveraged his new power and popularity to tighten his grip on Florida's GOP-controlled legislature, taking the unprecedented step of wading into the primaries of state lawmakers.\n\n\"He's the darling of Fox News,\" says Sean Shaw, a former Democratic state representative from Tampa. Consider DeSantis' overflowing war chest, he adds, and that \"he's mentioned as a leading contender for president. No state senator from some county in Florida wants to deal with that.\"\n\nLast spring, the Republican leaders of the legislature engaged in a rare skirmish with DeSantis over his push to take over their traditional map-drawing powers. DeSantis won that fight to dictate the maps-which dismantled two majority-Black districts-and he would not forget that the losers had crossed him. After they passed a budget, he issued $3.1 billion in line-item vetoes, slashing more than $700 million from the leaders' own top priorities.\n\nThat June, DeSantis took the stage at the Villages, the massive retirement community and Republican stronghold sprawling across 32 square miles of central Florida. A placard heralded his signing of the resulting \"Freedom First Budget.\" Minutes into the hourlong event, DeSantis bragged about his cuts. Over his left shoulder, the legislature's GOP leaders applauded and smiled. Their faces didn't betray what was likely an uncomfortable, even infuriating moment. \"They may not be clapping about that,\" DeSantis said, jerking his thumbs behind him to laughter, \"but that's just the way it goes.\" When he was done speaking, the lawmakers dutifully took a turn at the podium to praise DeSantis' leadership before posing behind him as he signed.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times noted the striking image-a Republican governor mocking the Republican-controlled legislature, and the leaders of that legislature laughing along-and called the spectacle his \"latest show of power.\" While the governor's office defends the cuts as \"fiscally responsible decisions,\" Stipanovich believes DeSantis was making an example out of them for opposing his redistricting takeover: \"All of you other legislators out there looking who aren't even presidents of the Senate, watch and learn.\" Nikki Fried, a Democrat who served as the state's agriculture commissioner at the time, used stronger language: \"It's like an abusive husband making his kids watch as he beats their mother.\"\n\nRepublican legislators got the message. \"We have a long tradition of legislative leaders pushing back against the governors of their own party when they felt they infringed upon legislative prerogatives,\" says Ben Diamond, a Democrat who served in the state House until last November. But not today: \"I've never seen a group of people so willing to give a governor a blank check.\"\n\nIn February, the legislature even convened a special one-week session to clean up some of DeSantis' messes and hand him more power. The GOP supermajority retroactively authorized his Fox-ready stunt to fly asylum seekers from Texas to Martha's Vineyard. They also empowered a statewide prosecutor to go after election crimes after the attorney general's office ran up against the limits of its legal authority. And they gave DeSantis the power to appoint the board that would oversee municipal affairs at Disney World-part of an escalating feud between the governor and the entertainment giant over its opposition to his \"Don't Say Gay\" law prohibiting instruction on gender identity and sexuality through third grade and limiting it through high school.\n\nDeSantis is not a backslapping politician. He has few social graces and no appetite for socializing, preferring, his staff claims, to spend his \"non-office time\" with family. As his one-way relationship with the legislature shows, he extracts favors but rarely returns them. \"Most politicians, you gain respect from your colleagues and your peers by working with them, by not being a jerk, by having good conversations and good relationships,\" says Fried, who now chairs Florida's Democratic Party. \"He cannot do that. So the only way that he's going to be able to move his agenda is through fear and intimidation.\"\n\nFried, who as agriculture commissioner served alongside DeSantis in the Florida Cabinet, recalls that DeSantis never joined in when fellow members bantered about their families or exchanged pleasantries before meetings. In early 2019, when the Cabinet was on a trade mission to Israel, Fried remembers how DeSantis always stood apart from the three other members and never rode in a vehicle with them. When they shared an elevator, she recalls trying some friendly chitchat, but DeSantis wouldn't engage.\n\nFollowing the presidency of Donald Trump, Americans may be primed to link magnetic personalities with autocratic ambition. But not all would-be authoritarians rely on personal appeal. \"Putin wasn't charismatic, either. Putin was a total cold fish,\" says Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University historian and the author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present . \"People who come from the realm of bureaucracy...don't necessarily have to be charismatic because they want to be feared and not loved. Now, somebody like Trump needs to be loved as well as feared, but DeSantis just wants to be feared. His remoteness, actually, is a shield, where it helps him be ruthless and dominant.\"\n\nEven as a baseball player and frat brother at Yale, one classmate recalled, DeSantis was \"so charmless.\" After graduating from Harvard Law School, he served as a Navy attorney, spending time at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq. Back in Florida in 2008, he took an assignment as a federal prosecutor before running for Congress in 2012. Through three House terms, DeSantis was a \"loner\" and a \"backbencher,\" former colleagues have said . But when an opportunity arose to run for governor, he recognized a path to greater power by sucking up to Trump on Fox News and securing his primary endorsement.\n\nTo understand how DeSantis differs from Trump, it helps to compare their approaches to politics. \"Trump got by mostly by saying stuff-not doing stuff. He talked much more than he threw punches. He threw many more punches than he landed,\" says Levitsky. \"DeSantis can't win that way. He has to do stuff.\" This comes in the form of political spectacles like marooning immigrants on the island where Barack Obama has his beach house and firing Warren-as well as substantive policies like the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, all boosted through tightly controlled press appearances. DeSantis' team has a habit of blasting reporters-and screenshots of the emails they send-over Twitter. When I sought comment for this story, his spokesperson called my questions \"brain-wormed\" and tweeted them out for supporters to mock. Such actions win DeSantis base support, but they are not dependent on his own charms.\n\nOne way DeSantis has created space to operate is by hollowing out state government, filling key posts with donors and loyalists-the academic term is \"autocratic capture\"-perhaps most notably on the state Board of Medicine, which has supported his agenda to put new limits on gender-affirming care. An analysis by the Democratic super-PAC American Bridge 21st Century found that over his first term, DeSantis installed 75 percent more donors in senior government roles than his predecessor, Republican Rick Scott, did in the same span. Such power grabs are \"a cornerstone of authoritarianism,\" explains Ben-Ghiat, and \"create a climate where you can more efficiently transform everything.\"\n\nIn The Courage to Be Free , a book DeSantis released in February, he warns that America has entered a \"post-Constitutional order\" where federal agencies have become an all-powerful fourth branch of government that must be brought \"to heel\" to restore democracy. But around the world, the opposite is true. \"An entrenched civil service and state agencies that have a long tradition of independence from the government-that's pretty critical in a democracy,\" says Levitsky. In \"almost every autocracy, we find one of the first moves is to pack the state-whether it is prosecutors' offices, school superintendents, police, when they can the judiciaries, electoral authorities-whatever state agencies exist.\"\n\nLast fall, Robert Cassanello taught a course on the civil rights movement. But for the first time, the veteran University of Central Florida history professor inserted content warnings into his lectures. Under a 2022 law formally given the Orwellian name of the Individual Freedom Act, also referred to as HB 7, Florida restricted educators' ability to teach concepts like critical race theory, structural racism, sex discrimination, white or male privilege, and affirmative action. The law also limits how private employers can discuss such issues, which helps explain what it is usually called: the Stop WOKE Act, meaning Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees.\n\nBefore diving into a topic Cassanello thought might breach the law, he would say, \"'Okay everybody, I'm about to violate HB 7. Be prepared. If you're going to report me, start taking your documentation down now,'\" he recalls. \"And then I would go do the thing.\" Students would laugh, Cassanello says, but he was trying to make a serious point: \"I thought it was important for students to understand the implications of the law to them.\"\n\nThe threat of being turned in by a student is real. In 2021, Florida enacted a law intended to combat perceived discrimination against campus conservatives by authorizing students to secretly record professors in order to bring lawsuits or report them to school authorities. Cassanello, who leads the university's chapter of the United Faculty of Florida union, says he never considered changing his lessons, figuring he had tenure, UFF membership, and, he hoped, academic freedom on his side; if he was terminated, he would at least have some recourse. But Cassanello says that other instructors who lack tenure protections, as most University of Central Florida professors do, made different decisions, with many telling him, \"I can't teach this anymore because I don't want to lose my job.\"\n\nThe law authorizing secret recordings also mandated that faculty and students fill out an annual \"intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity\" survey, just one of many new oversight tools DeSantis and his legislative allies have imposed. At the end of 2022, DeSantis ordered state higher education institutions to turn over descriptions of all classes and activities related to DEI and critical race theory, information on faculty teaching those topics or involved in those efforts, and an accounting of relevant funding. And in February, the Florida House's GOP speaker joined the battle, demanding faculty involved in once state-mandated DEI groups hand over two years of related emails, text messages, and social media posts. The effort calls to mind a surveillance state, where snitching is encouraged, the government keeps enemies lists, and free speech is censored.\n\n\"Almost invariably, universities are bastions of opposition to autocratic parties, government parties, movements, leaders-and so they're their targets,\" says Levitsky. Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet banned the teaching of philosophy and social sciences, believing they injected students with liberal ideas; by the end of his second year in power, more than 24,000 faculty, students, and staff had been expelled, with many sent to prison. Viktor Orbán, Hungary's authoritarian prime minister, effectively banned gender studies in 2018, and he forced a liberal arts college founded by Soros to flee. DeSantis, similarly, has orchestrated a takeover of New College, a small Florida liberal arts school, installing culture war provocateur Chris Rufo on its board.\n\nDeSantis and his Republican legislative allies have taken other steps to bring colleges and universities under a tight rein. One 2022 measure allowed institutions to conduct presidential searches in secret, outside the scope of Florida's robust sunshine laws. A few months later, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska ended up in charge of the University of Florida without any disclosure of the process. At New College, DeSantis' handpicked board fired its president, naming the governor's former commissioner of education as interim leader while a secret search continues. And in May, a GOP legislator and DeSantis ally emerged as the final candidate to lead South Florida State College after the DeSantis-friendly board in charge of hiring lowered the job's requirements. \"It's funny how this law was put through, and now it's all Republican politicians from in state and around the country who are leading higher education institutions,\" says Andrew Gothard, president of the 36,000-member UFF union.\n\nDuring this spring's legislative session, Republicans passed new academic mandates, banned funding DEI programs, and took faculty hiring decisions away from deans or departmental committees, placing them in the hands of university presidents. \"They want the hiring process to be about who politically toes the governor's line,\" Gothard says. The law also empowers the Board of Governors overseeing Florida's universities-with a DeSantis-­appointed majority-to review and ban curricula \"based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political, and economic inequities.\"\n\nIt's not obvious which programs and courses fall under the legislation's vague standard. \"Would I say that gender studies is based on a theory that systemic sexism exists in the institutions of the United States?\" asks Nicole Morse, who directs the Center for Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Florida Atlantic University. \"Yes.\"\n\nDeSantis' attack on academic freedom has already taken a toll. Despite years of growth in the center's graduate program, Morse says, this fall enrollment will go down by more than half, as many admitted students declined offers, usually citing Florida's political climate. And departments without enough enrollment get closed. \"As long as they just scare people away and make Florida a hostile area for this kind of work, that can achieve the same goal as an outright ban,\" Morse warns.\n\nThe onslaught of rules, surveillance, lawsuits, lists, and bans has created an atmosphere of chaos and fear on Florida campuses. \"The provost will say, in one meeting, 'No one's job is threatened.' And then the next meeting, or even later in the same meeting, she'll say, 'We don't know if we can protect anyone,'\" said one Florida professor who asked for anonymity.\n\n\"The most authoritarian aspect of this is just how the information is constantly changing,\" they continued. \"The atmosphere is one of everyone being constantly anxious, constantly confused...there's no solid ground or no clarity about what is happening and how to move forward.\"\n\nTrump was known for whipping up political mayhem, but on a day-to-day basis he seemed to largely unleash it on his inner circle. DeSantis, by contrast, strategically deploys chaos to advance his political priorities. \"This is part of using the law for repressive purposes, but in vague ways,\" says Ben-Ghiat. \"You create confusion, you create discouragement, and ultimately, you create silence and inaction.\"\n\nFederal courts generally find vague laws unconstitutional because they violate due process and lead to inconsistent enforcement. When, in November, Judge Mark Walker blocked the Stop WOKE Act in higher education, he wrote that one of the eight prohibited concepts \"is mired in obscurity, bordering on the unintelligible\" and \"features a rarely seen triple negative, resulting in a cacophony of confusion.\" But legal challenges can take months or years before they are resolved, and the ongoing litigation and debate can even magnify intimidation.\n\n\"DeSantis, we need to remember, is a product of Harvard Law,\" says University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks. \"His attempts to punish Disney, for instance, his attempts to restrict what private employers are doing-he knows that that violates the First Amendment,\" she adds. \"What he is trying to figure out is, can he remake the law? Can the new, far-right conservative movement, which seems to be a kind of might-makes-right movement, can he put that into effect?\"\n\nMorse, who turned over emails under the House speaker's request, has seen growing self-censorship: \"People are refusing to communicate in certain ways.\" (I noticed this too; my requests to interview professors were sometimes returned from private email accounts asking me not to use university addresses.) \"By starting with the list-making and searching people's emails, now, people are on edge,\" they said, adding that graduates have contacted the program asking to be removed from alumni lists. \"Everyone is starting to see the possibility for increased surveillance.\"\n\nThe political takeover is not just scaring off potential students; it is driving away faculty. As a union representative, Cassanello is keeping tabs. Those in the humanities generally quit academia altogether, he says, whereas professors in hard science, computing, engineering, and other fields with nationwide demand can move, depriving Florida of knowledge workers who sustain its universities with research grants and are key to its economy.\n\n\"A few people have come out to me, some of them department chairs,\" Cassanello recalls, \"who said, 'We're not getting candidates for our searches.'\" Hiring committees used to boasting about nearby beaches, one professor explained, now parry questions about forbidden topics and tenure protections. At an April hearing, a Democratic state senator shared that, according to the HR director of one Florida university, in just one month this spring more than 300 instructors rescinded offers to teach the following semester.\n\nDeSantis is \"willing to burn this entire system in the fire of his own political ambition,\" says Gothard. \"But the mess he's creating with these attacks on public ed-both K-12 and higher ed-are going to significantly and deeply harm Florida for decades.\"\n\nOne hallmark of authoritarianism is how a strongman's views take hold across society. \"All areas of life eventually reflect the values of the chief, of the leader,\" says Ben-Ghiat. Doing so requires controlling or cowing any centers of resistance, especially corporate interests. Trump's clumsy attempts to target the private sector revolved around trying to block mergers of corporations he disliked. Successful authoritarians are more aggressive. Putin made an example of corporate detractors by prosecuting the country's wealthiest businessman. According to Robert Kaufman, a Rutgers University professor who studies democratic backsliding, both Orbán in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey have used \"regulatory weapons to intimidate private sector corporations [and] reorient them as allies.\"\n\nIn 2021, after Facebook and Twitter booted Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, DeSantis pushed through a law -so far blocked in federal court-that would levy hefty fines against social media companies that ban politicians. At the time, Florida lawmakers took care to craft a loophole for media giant Disney, one of the state's largest employers, by exempting companies that also owned a theme park in Florida.\n\nBut a year later, after Disney came out against \"Don't Say Gay,\" the governor retaliated . \"There is a new sheriff in town and accountability will be the order of the day,\" DeSantis said in February, as he appointed allies to a reconstituted local tax board that would oversee the area around Disney World. The board, he implied, would also keep an eye on Disney content: \"I think all of these board members very much would like to see the type of entertainment that all families can appreciate.\"\n\nFor more than a year, DeSantis' effort to assert his control over Disney and its special tax district put him at loggerheads with the media conglomerate-which brings in the bulk of Orlando's $75 billion in annual tourism revenue-and Disney initially chose not to fight back publicly. But the company finally returned fire in April shortly after DeSantis mused that he might build a state prison on the park's doorstep, with the company saying it was \"left with no choice\" but to sue over his \"targeted campaign of government retaliation.\" In another signal of its new stance, Disney World is set to host its first Pride night in June.\n\nDeSantis' decision to take on Disney was a shot across the private sector's bow: fall in line or the state will come knocking. \"He's making examples of even companies that no one else would go after,\" explains Ben-Ghiat. \"It's not logical in a way to go after Disney, which is an enormous source of tourism and revenue. But if you think like an authoritarian, that's exactly who you're gonna go after, because you want to show that no one is exempt from your power.\"\n\nWhile Disney is his most high-profile corporate target, DeSantis has picked fights with other businesses. After the Tampa Bay Rays spoke out against gun violence and donated to a group that supports gun regulations, DeSantis responded by vetoing funding for a youth sports complex that the ballclub hoped to use during spring training. As DeSantis later explained , it's \"inappropriate to subsidize political activism of a private corporation.\"\n\n\"DeSantis' willingness to bend the power of government to punish Disney for having an opinion always meant that he would be willing to do that to individuals and small businesses, too,\" says Equality Florida's Wolf. DeSantis has been at the vanguard of the nationwide assault on transgender people, and has gone after small businesses that host drag shows. Last July, DeSantis filed a complaint through the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation against R House, a Miami restaurant that hosts weekend drag brunches, accusing it of violating a public nuisance law and putting its liquor license at risk. \"We take the wellbeing of children very seriously,\" DeSantis said at a press conference, complaining that the establishment had allowed minors to attend. In February, the DeSantis administration filed a similar complaint against a nonprofit associated with the Orlando Philharmonic for hosting a Christmas drag show where minors were present, and in March he went after Miami's Hyatt Regency over the same issue.\n\nThe Stop WOKE Act also targets businesses conducting DEI and unconscious bias trainings. Sara Margulis, the CEO of Clearwater-based Honeyfund, a platform where couples register for cash wedding gifts, turned to lawyers for advice on how she could continue to hold such workshops. \"You're gonna have to hire us to scrutinize every training that you deliver, to ensure that it complies,\" she recalls them saying. \"Even then we would have a hard time really knowing if it did or didn't.\"\n\nAfter weighing the risks of challenging DeSantis, last June Margulis became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by Protect Democracy. \"The Stop WOKE Act, to us, is government censorship and is a speech code,\" says Shalini Agarwal, the group's lead attorney on the case. \"This is a straight-up authoritarian move.\"\n\nMark Mizruchi, a University of Michigan sociologist who studies corporate political behavior, says \"business does have a key role to play\" in what he describes as \"an existential crisis regarding the future of American democracy.\" In the mid-20th century, US corporate elites were largely politically moderate and helped marginalize the extreme right, Mizruchi explains; today the business community is less organized and, with a far-right takeover of the GOP accomplished, is either aligned with those forces or afraid to take them on. Indeed, it was Honeyfund-joined by a Ben and Jerry's franchise and a DEI consultant-that was willing to go to court to fight the governor's restrictions on speech. Disney, a behemoth public company, only sued to stop DeSantis' retaliation.\n\nBut Disney may now be embracing a new role as a First Amendment defender. \"Disney also knows that it is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the State's retaliation-a stand smaller businesses and individuals might not be able to take,\" the company's lawsuit states . \"In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.\"\n\nLast August, DeSantis, again flanked by local sheriff deputies, arrived in a Broward County courtroom for another Fox-ready photo op. Earlier that year, DeSantis had launched a crackdown on illegal voting, spearheaded by his newly created Office of Election Crimes and Security. Now, he was ready to announce its first enforcement action: the arrests of 20 people for voter fraud. \"They're going to pay the price,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe arrests were part of DeSantis' sustained attack on the voting rights of people with felony convictions. Until five years ago, they were disenfranchised under Florida's constitution, a relic of the Jim Crow era that blocked nearly 1.7 million Floridians with a criminal record from voting, including one in five Black citizens of voting age. But in 2018, on the same day DeSantis narrowly won election, Floridians overwhelmingly approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to most people who had completed their sentences.\n\nAfter taking office, DeSantis and Republicans in the legislature immediately set out to undermine the amendment, adding a requirement that the new voters must first pay all their legal fines, fees, and restitution. But the state never made it possible for its citizens to find out if they have any such debts; experts believe records are so scattered, error-riddled, and incomplete that creating a trustworthy database would be impossible. \"It's designed to fail,\" says Daniel Smith, a University of Florida political scientist who, during an unsuccessful federal court challenge, testified the system is impossible to navigate.\n\nWhen the Tampa Bay Times published bodycam footage of the August crackdown, it became clear that the arrestees were a far cry from the nefarious election riggers DeSantis was sounding the alarm about. In fact, they had no idea they were not allowed to vote. \"Oh my god,\" Romona Oliver repeated as she was handcuffed in her driveway while leaving for work. \"I voted, but I ain't commit no fraud.\"\n\nVideo of Nathan Hart's arrest demonstrated the catch-22 they had been ensnared in. Handcuffed, Hart told the officers a DMV worker had encouraged him to register. \"I said, 'I'm a convicted felon, I'm pretty sure I can't,'\" Hart relayed. He said the clerk told him, \"'Well, just fill out this form, and if they let you vote, then you can.'\" To which an apologetic officer replied, \"There's your defense. That sounds like a loophole to me.\"\n\nThe people arrested that day were mostly Black Floridians who had served their time and believed their voting rights had been restored. Amendment 4 had carved out people convicted of murder or sex felonies; while Hart, Oliver, and the other arrestees had been convicted of such crimes, the state had mistakenly approved their applications anyway.\n\nDesmond Meade, executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the group that shepherded Amendment 4, compares the arrests to the state installing an inaccurate speed limit and nonetheless booking compliant drivers for going too fast. \"Can a police officer now take you to jail,\" Meade asks, \"when there was a posted speed sign that was placed there by the state saying it was okay?\"\n\nOn the voting charges, Oliver pleaded no contest, receiving no jail time. Hart was convicted, sentenced to two years' probation, and lost both his jobs. His attorneys are appealing. In the meantime, the widely publicized arrests and prosecutions have had a chilling effect. \"We started to get a bunch of calls from returning citizens throughout the state who were very concerned,\" says Aidil Oscariz, an attorney who worked with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. \"They just heard people were getting arrested for voting... they were very afraid.\"\n\nThe confusion extended beyond potential voters with felony records. When Oscariz called several county election supervisors looking for official information about how people with felony convictions could ascertain if they were free of fines and eligible, they had no answers; at least one suggested Oscariz call FRRC-the organization she was consulting for-for more information. Meanwhile, FRRC was hearing from people who had decided it wasn't worth voting-even individuals who had never been found guilty of a crime.\n\nComing less than a week before the 2022 primary and the start of the general election, the arrests were well timed to suppress turnout, and seemed to have an obvious political motivation. \"The state registered these people, these former incarcerated felons,\" says Shaw, the former state lawmaker. \"DeSantis goes and arrests them for voter fraud, because they should not have been allowed to register to vote. And if you don't think that depressed turnout amongst Black people, then I got another thing to tell you.\"\n\nNot all voter fraud is handled equally in Florida. In 2020, four white residents of the Villages-three of them registered Republicans who had voiced support for Trump-were charged with voting in two states. They all pleaded guilty, and got off with taking a civics course. Meanwhile, in a separate case, one person of color convicted after accidentally voting illegally received a 10-month sentence. This year, Florida exited an interstate compact that helps ferret out double voting, leaving the state much less likely to catch a kind of intentional fraud that Republicans have been more likely to commit in recent years.\n\n\"He likes to call us the Free State of Florida,\" adds Shaw. \"But that freedom only applies to people that look like him and that think like him. And if you don't, then this state is not free at all.\"\n\nVoter suppression is a widely practiced authoritarian strategy. It's also an American pastime. The recent reemergence of Jim Crow-style tactics has been made possible by the rollback of Civil Rights-era protections. After Democrats surpassed Republicans in voting by mail during the 2020 election, DeSantis signed a law that made postal ballots harder to obtain, limited drop boxes, restricted third-party registration efforts, and banned providing food and water to waiting voters-tactics embraced by Republicans around the country that aim to suppress turnout among poor voters and voters of color.\n\nWhile a federal judge agreed with civil rights groups that argued the law illegally targeted Black voters, he allowed large parts to stand, including its changes to mail voting. Signing up to vote by mail now requires more forms of identification, and the request must be renewed every two years. In January, after the law took effect, hundreds of thousands of standing requests for mail ballots were canceled . The consequences were immediate: Local officials blamed it for depressing turnout in March municipal elections-in Broward County, for example, participation fell by half from 2021-and predicted the drop-off would persist in 2024.\n\nLast year, Franks, the University of Miami law professor, wrote an article for the Journal of Free Speech Law arguing that a neo-Confederate ideology is gaining sway in the Republican Party, one that seeks \"to use the power of the state to censor speech that threatens their values and to compel speech that serves them.\" Hostile \"to reproductive rights, voting rights, LGBTQ rights, and efforts to recognize and redress systemic racism and sexism,\" neo-Confederates hide their anti-speech agenda behind crusades against cancel culture, wokeism, and critical race theory. DeSantis \"may be the most obvious exemplar of neo-Confederate ideology, particularly when it comes to free speech and education,\" Franks says.\n\nWhile those currents remain white-hot in today's GOP, DeSantis' personal political star dimmed this spring as accounts of his standoffish personality proliferated and early endorsements went to Trump. Wealthy GOP donors have begun expressing doubts, particularly after his escalating tit for tat with Disney and his April signing of a six-week abortion ban, widely viewed as a general election liability. But even if DeSantis' national ambitions don't take him to the White House, his authoritarian style, far from withering, is likely to be embraced by fellow Republicans seeking to emulate his success.\n\nDeSantis has demonstrated a path to power based on circumventing the democratic process and preying on fear of minorities-a template that is already being adopted by GOP legislatures around the country. But if DeSantis becomes president in two years, critics warn, his brand of authoritarianism could take hold from Washington. \"If you're uncomfortable with the book banning, imagine giving him the keys to the US Department of Education,\" says Wolf. \"If you're uncomfortable with the migrant flights dumping people in a deserted parking lot somewhere, imagine giving him the keys to Border Patrol and ICE. If you're uncomfortable with the way he goes after voting rights, imagine the same conversations that Donald Trump was having with Georgia election officials [demanding they \"find\" votes he needed], but it's Ron DeSantis on a call that's not being recorded.\"\n\n\"DeSantis would finish what Trump started,\" says Ben-Ghiat, \"which is wrecking our democracy.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Gives a Green Light to Ethnic Cleansing\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nFor the past two weeks, Israeli officials have been embroiled in an appalling debate. A group of far-right extremists within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition have been calling on the government to encourage the \"voluntary migration\" of large numbers of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThese thinly veiled calls for ethnic cleansing have been widely condemned-both within Israel and by the Biden administration . Some Republicans have also gone on record rejecting the idea. \"I don't think you have to remove Palestinians from Gaza,\" GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley told CNN last week . \"I think you have to remove Hamas from Gaza.\"\n\nRon DeSantis apparently has a different view. During Wednesday night's Republican debate, CNN's Jake Tapper asked the Florida governor whether he would support \"the mass-removal of Palestinians from Gaza.\" DeSantis' response was less than clear, but he seemed to suggest that if the Israeli government did decide to remove millions of Palestinians from Gaza, he wouldn't stand in the way of that egregious human rights violation.\n\n\"We've got to support Israel in word and in deed, in public and in private, and they've got to be able to finish the job,\" DeSantis said. \"I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they're making with respect to Gaza. Look, there's a lot of pluses and minuses with how you're doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second-guessing them, I don't think that's the right way.\"\n\nTapper pressed for clarity. \"Do you support the mass-removal of Palestinians from Gaza?\" he asked again.\n\n\"As president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there's a lot of issues with that,\" DeSantis answered. \"But if they make the calculation that to avert a second Holocaust, they need to do that-I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some. Egypt should take some.\"\n\nDeSantis' claim that he isn't \"going to tell\" Israel to commit war crimes is less than reassuring. Many Israeli officials-even officials within Netanyahu's government-oppose ethnic cleansing for moral reasons, and they would presumably reject such a suggestion from a US president. But other Israeli politicians have criticized calls for \"voluntary migration\" precisely because they don't think the United States would ever permit it. \"It's not realistic, and it's clear that the international community will not accept it...we see the repercussions, we see what happened with the Americans,\" one Likud minister told Israel's Ynet news outlet.\n\nUnder increasing pressure to disavow his allies' demands for Palestinian expulsion, Netanyahu asserted Wednesday that \"Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.\" Another influential Likud lawmaker, Danny Danon, told the Times of Israel that Netanyahu only came around to that position because of American insistence:\n\n\"We had a faction meeting a few weeks ago when I asked him about voluntary relocation and he said it's a good idea and not easy to find countries that would accept Gazans,\" Danon confirmed, adding that he understood that Netanyahu's change of heart was due to American pressure.\n\n\"In the last few days, because of the pressure coming from a few countries, he stated that it's not the position of the government and Israel is not promoting it. [US Secretary of State Antony] Blinken said he got assurances,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nAnd that's what makes DeSantis' comments so dangerous. He's giving a green light to ethnic cleansing.\n\nUpdate, January 11: This story has been revised to include comments from Netanyahu and Danon.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Is Deploying \"Asshole Politics\" to Stop Florida's Abortion Referendum\n\nMother Jones; Dirk Shadd/Tampa Bay Times/Zuma\n\nWhen the US Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion in its 2022 Dobbs decision, one argument the justices made was that it was not banning abortion across the country, but rather granting states, and their voters, the opportunity to regulate the procedure. Since then, seven states have voted on their local abortion laws through ballot measures. From the liberal paradises of Vermont and California to redder states like Ohio and Kansas, all seven voted to protect abortion. In November, 10 more states are using ballot measures to address the topic, too.\n\nAmong them is Florida. Until 2022, the state allowed abortions until the third trimester. But since Dobbs , the state first enacted a ban on abortions after 15- weeks gestation , and subsequently a ban on abortions after six weeks, which took effect in May.\n\nFloridians Protecting Freedom (FPF) is trying to change that with Amendment 4, which the reproductive rights group added to Florida's November ballots by collecting more than 900,000 signatures. If enough Floridians vote \"yes\" on the ballot measure (official summary shown below), the referendum will theoretically enshrine in the Florida Constitution the right to abortion access up until fetal viability-which is generally around 23 to 24 weeks. As the referendum states:\n\nNo law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by the patient's healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\n\nMore than half of Florida voters support expanding abortion rights, according to polling by both Florida Atlantic University and the Hill/Emerson College. But whether this support ultimately alters the abortion landscape in the state is a different question.\n\nThat's because Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is using the power of his administration to threaten the initiative. He's appointed people to the Financial Impact Estimating Conference-a panel responsible for gauging potential costs of ballot measures-that required the amendment be accompanied by language stating, without evidence, that access to abortion may cost taxpayer dollars. State law enforcement has also been sent to question Floridians who signed the petition for Amendment 4 to appear on the ballot. He's enlisted a state agency to create a misleading website about abortions in Florida. Local news channels playing an advertisement supporting Amendment 4 have also been threatened with prosecution over the alleged violation of Florida's sanitary nuisance law, which is generally used to combat health risks like the improper disposal of human waste or dead animals. Later, on Oct. 21, the Miami Herald reported that the marching orders to threaten the media outlets with legal action came from top DeSantis deputies.\n\nOn Oct. 11, DeSantis further escalated his intimidation campaign when his state department released a 348-page preliminary report alleging FPF may have committed \"widespread petition fraud\" to reach the 891,000 signature Florida statute requires to advance ballot measures. In a statement, FPF says its campaign has been \"run above board and followed state law at every turn.\" Further, the state deadline to challenge amendment signatures has already passed .\n\nAnna Hochkammer, the executive director of the Florida Women's Freedom Coalition, says the administration is \"using the resources of the state to suppress the purest form of democracy, which in this case is necessary because an entrenched unrepresentative cabal of elected officials refuses to legislate in accordance with the overwhelming preferences of the citizens...Despite all of that, we are unbowed and unbroken.\"\n\n\"An entrenched unrepresentative cabal of elected officials refuses to legislate in accordance with the overwhelming preferences of the citizens...Despite all of that, we are unbowed and unbroken.\"\n\nBut the report could provide basis for a new, albeit insincere, legal argument against the ballot measure-and it seems it already has. On Wednesday, anti-abortion advocates filed a lawsuit citing the state missive, alleging that, \"When all fictitious, forged, illegally obtained, or otherwise invalid signatures are removed from consideration, Amendment 4 failed to reach the constitutionally required number of signatures for ballot placement.\" Accordingly, the lawsuit against FPF says, \"The invalid petitions must be stricken and Amendment 4 removed from the 2024 General Election.\"\n\nDeSantis didn't personally wage the lawsuit, but he did tee it up for the petitioners who did. Such tactics should not be surprising. Other GOP leaders, such as Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state lawmakers in Missouri , respectively tried to thwart similar initiatives through politically motivated lawsuits, exaggerated cost estimates, disinformation, and more.\n\nAs my colleague Ari Berman points out in his recent magazine story, this is particularly concerning because ballot measures are the only method in which majority rule by a plurality of a state's citizens can supersede the minority rule of increasingly and disproportionately powerful GOP state lawmakers who have re-drawn districts to benefit them staying in power.\n\nIn hyper-gerrymandered states like Ohio, the only way to ensure that the will of the majority is followed is to override representative democracy and go directly to the people. This strategy has taken on renewed urgency in response to recent US Supreme Court decisions taking away fundamental rights, from the gutting of the Voting Rights Act to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. These initiatives can garner support across party lines in a way that is otherwise impossible in a highly polarized partisan political climate.\n\nThe Supreme Court explicitly noted that the solution to abortion access is not-in the majority's opinion-protected by the US Constitution. Instead, as Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion, the 2022 Dobbs decision \"properly returns the Court to a position of neutrality and restores the people's authority to address the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self-government.\"\n\nIn other words, the court said, abortion is an issue that should be regulated through voting: either for political candidates whose reproductive rights views align with those of the voters or, even more directly, for ballot measures.\n\nThis is also-in theory-the party line of the GOP. In his presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump has emphasized this point. \"It's all about the states, it's about state rights. States' rights,\" Trump told Time magazine in April. \"States are going to make their own determinations.\"\n\nEven without DeSantis putting his thumb on the scale, Florida already had a high bar for passing referenda: As of 2006, 60 percent of voters are required to amend the state's constitution. Among conservative-leaning states-Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio-that have voted on abortion ballot measures, none have had to hit that high a mark. (Kansas was closest, at 59 percent).\n\nOrganizers of Amendment 4 say they believe Florida could be the first state to do so, but it's a harder task when the DeSantis administration is engaging in what Hochkammer calls \"asshole politics,\" which values \"power and posturing over good policy.\"\n\nFor example, both the proponents and opponents of Amendment 4 have television advertisements in Florida. A pro-Amendment 4 ad depicts a woman describing how a pre-ban abortion saved her life when she found out she had a brain tumor while also pregnant with her second child. \"The doctors knew that if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby. I would lose my life. And my daughter would lose her mom,\" the mom says in the 30-second clip. \"Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.\"\n\nFlorida's Department of Health alleged the advertisement was false in cease-and-desist letters, citing Florida's \"exception\" to save the life of a mother. But many physicians, who risk fines and prison time, argue that life-or-death scenarios are extremely complicated and often do not conform to the vague language of abortion-ban exceptions. According to the Herald , the health department's top counsel, John Wilson, resigned after sending the letters, which had been pre-written by a DeSantis lawyer. In an Oct. 17 affidavit , Wilson said he left the job in \"lieu of complying with directives\" from DeSantis deputies to \"send out further correspondence to the media outlets.\"\n\n\"A man is nothing without his conscience,\" Wilson wrote in his resignation letter, obtained by the Herald .\n\nIn the case of the woman who had a brain tumor, her diagnosis was terminal. According to a lawsuit filed in federal court by Floridians Protecting Freedom on Wednesday, the woman would not have met the requirements for an exception because an abortion only would have \"extend[ed]\" her life, not saved it. There are post-ban examples, too.\n\nIn another case, a 15-week pregnant woman was leaking amniotic fluid for an hour in a Broward County, Florida, hospital waiting room. Her ultrasound showed she had no amniotic fluid around her fetus, a condition that can quickly lead to serious infection and death. She was discharged and miscarried in a public restroom later that day, at which point was rushed to another hospital and put on a ventilator . She stayed in the hospital for six days.\n\n\"When you don't want to talk about the fact that your state has an abortion ban that's forced rape survivors to go out of state for care, that's led to women almost losing their lives,\" FPF campaign director Lauren Brenzel recently told Mother Jones , \"you create distractions because you don't want to talk about the harmful policy that you've implemented.\" She added, \"It's not shocking. It's the national playbook.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Insurers Gave Ron DeSantis Millions. He Made It Harder to Sue Them.\n\nMother Jones; Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/AP; Getty\n\nLast fall, Jonathan Stettin decided he and his longtime partner Jeanie would stay put in their Cape Coral, Florida, home, rather than evacuate for Hurricane Ian. Meteorologists had warned that the storm was destined to make landfall around Tampa, which is 130 miles north of Stettin's one-story modern stucco home near Fort Myers.\n\nBut the meteorologists were wrong. On September 28, 2022, the Category 4 storm's 150-mile-per-hour gales whipped the canal in Stettin's backyard into rapids. Stettin says the hurricane partially lifted his roof from its beams. Meanwhile, he and Jeanie huddled nervously in their bedroom's walk-in closet.\n\n\"We actually feared for our lives at one point,\" he says.\n\nTheir concern was surviving. He wasn't worried about how they would fix their home.\n\n\"'Thank God we're insured. It will be okay,'\" Stettin, 61, remembers thinking. \"That turned out to be the biggest miscalculation that I ever made in my life.\"\n\nStettin says it took roughly three months for his insurance company, Heritage, to get back to him with a payout: approximately $30,000. The amount, he says, is about one-tenth of what an independent public adjuster and a contractor estimated it would cost to replace his pulverized roof, air conditioner, and perimeter fence, and to repair the cracks in his home's exterior and interior walls, among other things. (Stettin says the insurance company was in possession of the much higher repair estimates from the independent adjuster and contractor. Heritage did not answer questions from Mother Jones .)\n\n\"You get victimized twice,\" Stettin says. \"Once by the storm. And second, by your own insurance company.\"\n\nStettin and Jeanie don't know what they will do if they lose the lawsuit they have brought against Heritage for not covering the entirety of their losses. Already, the bulk of Stettin's retirement savings has gone toward fixing what Heritage has not.\n\nStill, the couple counts themselves lucky: Hurricane Ian struck Florida in September 2022. Had it hit anytime after December 2022-when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis enacted a slate of insurance law changes -they likely would not have been able to sue Heritage at all. The sweeping revisions makes it more difficult for homeowners to sue their property insurance companies for acting in \"bad faith\" and removes the right of homeowners to recover attorney's fees, even in lawsuits they ultimately win. Additionally, the adjustments to Florida's insurance laws allow insurance companies to create new policies with mandatory binding arbitration agreements in exchange for a premium reduction, which will also thwart many homeowners' option to take insurers to court.\n\n\"It's now economically absurdly risky for a consumer to file a lawsuit, and it's going to be incredibly hard to find a good lawyer,\" says Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a nonprofit that advocates for insurance holders.\n\nMoreover, the legislation shortened the window in which policy holders can file claims with their insurers, invested $1 billion of taxpayer funds into a state-run reinsurance fund to help insurance companies mitigate their losses in the event of catastrophic events, and narrowed eligibility for Citizens, Florida's state-run nonprofit insurance company that provides insurance to people who cannot find affordable coverage on the regular market.\n\nIt was DeSantis who urged the three-day special legislative session in December 2022 that led to the hasty 105-page rewrite of the state's long-standing insurance code, which DeSantis then signed into law the same month.\n\nThat DeSantis got the opportunity to sign the bill into law in the first place is at least partially thanks to the insurance industry players who helped bankroll his pursuit of political office in Florida. Insurance industry employees donated at least $3.9 million to his gubernatorial race and to the \"Friends of Ron DeSantis\" political committee between January 2018 and December 2022. Additionally, a Heritage Insurance subsidiary and People's Trust Insurance together donated a total of $125,000 to DeSantis's 2023 inaugural celebration, according to a May 2023 report by the American Federation of Teachers union and three other advocacy groups.\n\n\"He gets a lot of money from insurance companies,\" says Michael DeLong, an insurance expert at the Consumer Federation of America. \"He wants to keep them happy.\"\n\nStettin's home insurance woes aren't an anomaly in Florida. The state's shape and location make it especially prone to hurricanes, which cause large repair bills, and therefore, large insurance claims.\n\nHurricane Andrew, the state's first Category 5 storm in 57 years, was a turning point for the industry. Home insurance carriers in the state faced more than $16 billion in insured losses from the 1992 hurricane-which destroyed more than 50,000 homes and caused 23 direct deaths-a circumstance the insurance carriers thought was \"highly unlikely and were not prepared for,\" according to research funded by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the federal government.\n\nAfter that, big storms kept hitting-both the state and the pockets of Florida's home insurance companies. Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, pummeled Florida in August 2004. Over the next 14 months, four Category 3 storms followed. A 10-year-lull preceded Florida's annihilation: Category 4 Irma hit the state in 2017. Category 5 Michael hit in 2018. And Category 4 Ian hit in 2022.\n\n\"The problem in Florida,\" says Birny Birnbaum, an insurance industry expert who leads the Center for Economic Justice, \"is that it's a tremendously catastrophe-prone location that has gotten more catastrophe-prone in the era of climate change.\"\n\nThe recent uptick in major hurricanes has exacerbated the trend that started with Andrew: insurers struggling to keep up with claims payouts. Many of the companies have since gone under, or they opted to exit the state before they went out of business, leaving homeowners with fewer policy options.\n\nEighteen Florida residential insurers are on the state regulator's watch list due to poor financial health, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III). In mid-July, one of the state's largest remaining insurers, Farmers, announced its decision to vacate Florida, leaving about 100,000 policyholders scrambling for new policies elsewhere. At least a dozen property insurers have left Florida or become insolvent since 2020.\n\nThat's what happened to Freda Holland, of Riviera Beach, Florida. Her home insurance carrier left Florida about a year-and-a-half ago. Her family's mortgage lender-like most-requires borrowers to have property insurance, so when Freda couldn't find a rate close to the $2,000 annual premium she had been paying, her home lender force-placed $4,000 property coverage on top of their mortgage.\n\nTheir new premium is close to the state's average of $4,231 , which is approximately three times the national average. Things don't stand to improve anytime soon. III predicts premiums in Florida will increase another 40 percent , on average, in 2023. The major price increase means the Hollands risk losing the quaint, olive-green ranch they've called home for the last 25 years-a tangible embodiment of Freda's work as a nursing assistant and her husband's long career as a construction worker. If the Hollands fall behind on their exponentially increased bill, they could default on their mortgage. \"Where am I gonna get all this money?\" asks Freda, 63.\n\nTheoretically, Holland should be able to switch to a Citizens policy, which might be cheaper. Though DeSantis' December 2022 statute changes bring new restrictions to Citizens plans: If she receives an offer from an authorized insurance company on the regular market that is less than 20 percent higher than what Citizens offers, she is not eligible. The same is true when someone attempts to renew their Citizens policy. Before a Citizens policy expires, Citizens will seek offers from private-market insurers, and if any of them offer a rate that is less than 20 percent more expensive than Citizens, that customer will get kicked off Citizens.\n\nThere's another caveat, too. Between 2023 and 2027, all Citizens policyholders must purchase flood insurance on the private market, with their deadline based on their home's insured value. The change increases the overall insurance costs that made Citizens a more affordable option for homeowners in the first place, and sends more money to the private insurance sector.\n\nWhen DeSantis visited areas impacted by Hurricane Ian a couple days after the storm, he didn't blame worsening or more frequent hurricanes for the state's rising premiums. He told a reporter for CNN the issue was policyholders and the lawsuits filed on their behalf.\n\nFlorida has long allowed policyholders to transfer their right to sue to other parties that have more wherewithal to go after insurance companies. There is a documented history of roofing contractors taking advantage of this by offering homeowners roofing inspections, persuading the customers to sign over their rights to file a claim to replace their roof, and then suing when the insurance company denies the claim because the roof is not badly damaged. The insurance companies often settle the claim, but the legal costs can be more than what it would have cost to replace the roof in the first place. \"You need to get rid of the scams and the litigation and I'm willing to do that,\" DeSantis told the CNN journalist.\n\nThe special session DeSantis called in December removed the ability to transfer this power to contractors in most cases, but it also scrapped a policy that has been on Florida's books since at least 1893: the one-way attorney fee system that allowed policyholders who successfully sued their insurance company to recover their legal costs. These policies were meant to discourage powerful insurance companies from failing to fulfill policyholders' claims with sufficient payouts. It's one reason Stettin was able to sue Heritage. (His case is currently in the discovery process.)\n\nThis previous structure was important, says DeLong, because \"the balance is pretty far tipped in favor of the insurance companies, which have really big resources, versus the individual or even groups of consumers.\"\n\nA March 2023 Washington Post investigation revealed how insurance companies in Florida use their upper-hand to shortchange their customers on claims. The story documents how regional insurance companies in Florida were \"aggressively seeking to limit payouts to policyholders by altering the work of licensed adjusters,\" reducing the amount the initial adjuster estimated by as much as 97 percent.\n\nUndoubtedly, the insurance law rewrites DeSantis orchestrated in 2022 will decrease the number of policyholders who seek legal recourse against their insurers, including firms acting in bad faith. \"You'd have to be either so rich that you don't care about losing money, or you'd have to be some kind of crusader, because it's going to be so expensive,\" says Bach.\n\nBy decreasing legal risk for insurance carriers, DeSantis argues there will be more competition among carriers, which could eventually decrease premium costs for consumers. \"If we do get more people to come and offer policies, you are finally going to have, potentially, choices,\" he said at the bill signing.\n\nBut experts are highly skeptical the changes will do anything beyond buoy insurance companies' bottom lines. Some don't even think litigation was a driving cause of rising premiums across the marketplace. In 2021, Birnbaum analyzed data on lawsuits from Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation and found that high levels of litigation were concentrated in a handful of insurance companies, suggesting that those companies should be investigated for their claims settlement practices.\n\n\"If litigation was the problem, you'd expect every company to be experiencing high levels of litigation,\" says Birnbaum.\n\n\"If you're not going to accept climate change as a reality, then you're left with making up false villains, like litigation, as the driver of higher rates,\" he adds. The recent tort overhaul is \"not going to do anything to reduce insurance premiums because it's not doing anything to reduce claim costs.\"\n\nAnother reason to be skeptical of the rampant-litigation theory, says Benjamin Keys, an economist and professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, is that \"we're seeing costs rise elsewhere in the country that don't have the same litigation problems.\"\n\nNationally, Insurify predicts annual premiums will increase an average of 9 percent in 2023, up from the 7 percent they rose in 2022. In other words, coastal states aren't the only ones that need to be paying attention to rising insurance costs.\n\nIn order to mitigate their losses, insurance companies prefer to write fewer policies in areas with higher weather risk. But the proportion of homes across the US that fall into that category are rising as fast as sea levels are. A February Washington Post analysis of property data, topography, and computer-modeled hurricane tracks created by the nonprofit First Street Foundation found that nearly 30 million Americans across 18 states in the contiguous US will soon face threats from hurricane-force winds. By 2053, a third of Americans-including those as far inland as Illinois and Tennessee-could risk property-damaging gusts.\n\n\"The problems that are affecting places like Florida and Louisiana, those are going to be growing problems elsewhere in the country,\" says Keys. Such is the case in California: While there has always been risk of wildfires and earthquakes out West, Tropical Storm Hilary proved the state has to prepare and respond to fierce winds and floods, too.\n\nAnd regardless of whether a state ever sees property damage from hurricane-strength winds, property owners in all states will see their premiums rise as a result of weather events elsewhere.\n\n\"The premiums paid in one state do not pay out the claims in that state. Insurers operate on a national scale. You can think about the way they set their premiums as safer people cross-subsidizing riskier people,\" Keys says. \"The insurance market in particular spreads the costs to other policyholders elsewhere.\"\n\nAs climate-related disasters and home insurance prices rise everywhere, future US presidents will increasingly face the challenge of regulating the home insurance industry in a way that protects consumers but also enables insurance companies to survive more high-claim payouts. DeSantis's response to the crisis in Florida may prove to be a vulnerability in his own 2024 campaign. Donald Trump has already attack him on this issue. \"RINO Ron DeSanctimonious is delivering the biggest insurance company BAILOUT to Globalist Insurance Companies, IN HISTORY,\" Trump wrote on social media in March.  \"He's also crushed Florida homeowners whose houses were destroyed in the Hurricane - They're getting pennies on the dollar... This is the worst Insurance Scam in the entire Country!\"\n\nExperts say improving the system would require taking climate change much more seriously; passing laws that force insurance companies to offer premium reductions for weather-proofing modifications homeowners make; setting up a reinsurance program run by the federal government that provides a backstop against mega-catastrophes, such as the reinsurance program the government created for terrorist events after the September 11, 2001 attacks; and enacting stricter accountability laws for insurers.\n\nA bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers did pass a bill aimed at increasing the accountability of home insurance providers in May, roughly two months after the Post's investigation revealed how the state's insurance companies were aggressively slashing the claims payouts adjusters recommended.\n\nAs of July 1, insurance companies can no longer change adjusters' reports without explaining the changes in documentation that must be retained. Insurance companies on the state's watchlist for poor finances can no longer grant their executives bonuses, and all insurance companies must submit their claims processes to Florida insurance regulatory bodies, which have to produce regular reports about how they are implementing the regulatory changes.\n\nBut the Center for Economic Justice's Birnbaum isn't holding his breath that Florida's insurance regulators will keep the insurance companies in line with these new rules. He points to Florida's last top insurance commissioner, David Altmaier, who abruptly resigned from his insurance watchdog role in December for a new job lobbying on behalf of insurance companies. He stepped through the revolving door just a few days before a law barring ex-Florida officials from lobbying their old agencies for six years took effect. (Altmaier's current work, according to his LinkedIn , is \"leverag[ing] over a decade of experience to help insurance and insurance-adjacent entities.\")\n\n\"You can pass all the laws that you want,\" Birnbaum says, \"but if you don't have an insurance department that's willing to enforce it or able to enforce it, it's not going to make a difference.\"\n\nJonathan Stettin is also dubious the new insurance rules will protect him and Jeanie. After Hurricane Ian destroyed his shingle roof, he opted to replace it with a metal one that cost significantly more but should better protect his home the next time a hurricane hits. At that point, suing will not be an option for him.\n\n\"Although I pay for insurance,\" Stettin says, \"in reality, with the new law, I have no insurance.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Who Owns Ron DeSantis?\n\nNina Wang , David Corn , and Russ Choma November 20, 2023\n\nMother Jones; Bryon Houlgrave/AP\n\nMother Jones; Bryon Houlgrave/AP\n\nIn recent months, Ron DeSantis has received a load of bad press focused on his slippage in the 2024 polls, shake-ups within his organization, and less-than-stellar campaign finances . Yet the Florida governor is one of the most prodigious political cash-chasers in recent US history. When he successfully ran for reelection in Florida in 2022, DeSantis, who was first elected to the Sunshine State's top executive position four years earlier, raised a whopping $211 million for his state political committee and set an all-time record for gubernatorial fundraising. Along the way, he collected huge bundles of campaign money from eccentric billionaires, magnates who had run afoul of the law, corporations that seek lucrative contracts from the government he runs, and even a prominent businessman once identified by law enforcement authorities as associated with a Mafia crime family.\n\nWhat made DeSantis' money-grab such a feat was that most of the candidates he surpassed were tycoons who had poured their own fortunes into their campaign treasuries. (Businesswoman Meg Whitman dumped $144 million of personal funds into her unsuccessful quest in 2010 for the California governorship.) DeSantis topped them all by hitting up corporations, fat-cat donors, and political action committees for super-sized contributions. Gargantuan donations in the six-, seven-, and eight-digit range poured into his political pockets. Of the more than 200,000 contributors to his 2022 effort, 313 handed him $100,000 or more, with 11 slipping DeSantis $1 million or more. These $100,000-and-above donations accounted for $113 million, or 54 percent of his total take.\n\nFlorida imposes no restraints on the size of political donations to state political committees. (In a presidential race, a contributor can only give $3,300 directly to a candidate, but an unlimited amount to an independent-expenditure committee, better known as a super PAC, which supports the candidate.) DeSantis took advantage of Florida's wide-open campaign finance system to bring in a never-before-seen amount of dollars, swamping his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist, who collected a measly $32 million . Despite DeSantis' current financial woes, the 2022 contest demonstrates that he can pull in the big bucks. It also shows who has their hooks into DeSantis.\n\nA large chunk of the cash DeSantis raised for his gubernatorial race has gone into boosting his presidential bid-perhaps illegally. At the end of his successful reelection contest, DeSantis had about $82 million remaining in his war chest. Earlier this year, what was left of his state campaign committee transferred that money to a super PAC called Never Back Down that has been supporting DeSantis' presidential effort. \"There's no question that it's illegal for a federal candidate to transfer money they raised for a state committee to a federal super PAC,\" Erin Chlopak, senior director for campaign finance at Campaign Legal Center who worked for nearly a decade as part of the Federal Election Commission's Office of General Counsel, told OpenSecrets, a nonprofit, in May. The Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United each have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission alleging that DeSantis' transfer of money raised for a state campaign to a federal campaign violates federal election law.\n\nThough DeSantis routinely blasts the so-called swamp-\"I don't want top drain the swamp, I want to break it,\" he has exclaimed -and decries elites and the \"ruling class,\" this list of donors is chockfull of the rich and powerful: people, companies, and PACs that seek out policies and favors from elected officials. While major presidential candidates are often the recipients of similar largesse via political parties and PACs, few office-seekers in modern-day America have directly received such immense donations from so many sources as has DeSantis. He is-or was-a king of big-money politics.\n\nHis 2022 gubernatorial race provides a perspective into DeSantis' fundraising world. It reveals that while holding power in the state of Florida, he has pursued ultra-rich and out-of-state donors to fill his campaign chest. His roster of contributors includes businesses that his administration awarded major contracts.\n\nSo even as DeSantis trods a rougher path in the 2024 GOP race, it's worth looking at the well-heeled spenders who financed his last political venture. These are his underwriters-the people and organizations to which he is indebted and would be should he find himself in the White House.\n\nBelow is a long list of the members of DeSantis' $100,000-Plus Club. (The number of donors who handed him between $10,000 and $100,000-nothing to sneeze at-is also substantial: 1,754 people and entities.) And there are contributors and patterns that warrant a shout-out before we turn to the roll call.\n\nThe most generous financial supporters of DeSantis' gubernatorial campaign were Republican outfits, such as the Republican Governors Association ($21 million), and the usual assortment of GOP megadonors: Robert Bigelow ($10 million), a hotel magnate who has used his fortune to fund efforts seeking to prove the existence of UFO aliens and an afterlife; Ken Griffin ($5 million), the CEO of multinational hedge fund Citadel and a reliable source of money for conservative candidates and causes; Walter Buckley Jr. ($1.25 million), the co-founder of a venture capital fund that made a fortune in the dot-com bubble; Paul Tudor Jones II ($1 million), a hedge-fund billionaire who has played both sides of the street by supporting the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama , John McCain , Mitt Romney , and Rudy Giuliani ; and Bruce Rauner, ($960,000), a former GOP governor of Illinois who lives in a posh gated community in Key Largo, Florida, which received early access to Covid vaccination. (Griffin has yet to commit to a 2024 candidate. Recently, he was talking up former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.)\n\nThe list continues: Richard Uihlein ($700,000), the billionaire co-founder with wife Elizabeth Uihlein ($500,000) of the Uline shipping company, who financed a group that organized the rally that preceded the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and candidates involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 election; Charles Johnson ($594,919), a principle partner of the San Francisco Giants and a financial underwriter of pro-Trump election deniers; Edward DeBartolo Jr. ($522,000), a businessman best known as former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020 for his involvement in a gambling fraud case in Louisiana in the 1990s; Bernie Marcus ($500,000), a cofounder of Home Depot, who has denounced \"woke people [who] have taken over the world\" (Marcus recently endorsed Donald Trump); and John Childs ($456,592), the chairman of a private equity firm who was charged with solicitation of prostitution in 2019 in a Florida sex spa scandal. (The charges were later dropped and his record expunged.)\n\nOf course, far-right groups kicked in loads of cash, led by the Club for Growth PAC ($2 million) and the Judicial Crisis Network ($500,000). DeSantis' money-bags included business PACs-for instance, the Realtors Political Advocacy Committee ($375,203) and the Voice of Florida Business Political Action Committee ($475,000)-as well as those companies and entities that do business with the state, foremost among them the Seminole Tribe of Florida ($2 million), with whom DeSantis forged a $2.5 billion deal that allowed the tribe to expand its gambling operations to include sports betting, craps, and roulette.\n\nOther one-hand-washes-the-other contributions came from Phillips and Jordan ($252,500), a construction firm that was granted a $175.8 million contract by the state for an Everglades restoration project; Nomi Health ($252,250), which was handed $46 million in contracts by the state in 2021 for Covid-19 testing and vaccine work; and Herzog Contracting ($250,000), which pocketed at least $32.7 million in contracts from the Florida Department of Transportation during DeSantis' tenure. JM Family Enterprises, a huge automotive conglomerate that lobbied the state legislature to pass a bill banning most automaker-to-consumer direct sales that DeSantis later signed, sent $325,000 to his campaign.\n\nDeSantis' top donors are riddled with folks and outfits with checkered pasts. For example, HillCour, Inc. ($312,409) and another firm agreed to pay over $7 million to the US Health and Human Services Department to resolve allegations in 2018 related to a Medicaid kickback scheme. Onetime Los Angeles nightclub mogul Sam Nazarian ($179,581) in 2014 gave up control of a Las Vegas hotel after an investigation revealed he had used drugs and paid $3 million in alleged extortion payments to felons. Health Option One ($125,000) faced a lawsuit in 2021 for an alleged bait-and-switch scam in which customers were duped into buying limited-coverage health care plans. The company denied the allegations and later agreed to settle the dispute.\n\nBusinessman John Cafaro ($120,000) in 2010 was sentenced to three years' probation for failing to disclose a loan to his daughter's congressional campaign. Las Vegas tycoon Steve Wynn ($100,000) was accused last year by the Justice Department of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China and lobbying Trump on that country's behalf in order to protect his business interests in Macau. (A federal judged dismissed the case; government lawyers are currently appealing the decision.) Separately, Wynn was accused of sexually harassing dozens of his employees and pressuring them to perform sexual acts. He agreed to pay Nevada a $10 million settlement in July to resolve the sexual misconduct case. DeSantis accepted $100,000 from the John Rosatti Trust, a fund connected to businessman John Rosatti , an automotive and restaurant tycoon (and founder of BurgerFi) who three decades ago was linked to the mob . Rosatti was identified by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement as an alleged associate of the Colombo crime family in New York City, according to a 1993 decision by the state's Casino Control Commission.\n\nOther notable contributions came from Leila Centner ($301,000), the co-founder of the Miami-based Centner Academy, which was a hotbed of anti-vax activism and disinformation during the Covid pandemic; Adam Marcus Hendry ($100,000), whose company, Tzadik Management, filed more evictions during the early days of the pandemic than any other landlord in Florida, according to a July 2020 analysis by the Center for Public Integrity; and the Portopiccolo Group ($100,000), a private equity company that acquired nursing homes during the pandemic and caused disruptions at facilities that resulted in weakened care for residents, according to investigations by the Washington Post and the New Yorker . Tread Standard LLC, a mysterious shell company , handed $210,000 to DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis rounded up quite a collection of billionaires, corporations, right-wingers, and reprobates, as he collected over one-fifth of a billion dollars for his 2022 campaign. Never before in modern American politics has a non-presidential candidate bagged so much in direct donations from the well-heeled and special interests. At this point, DeSantis is far from a good bet to be the next resident of the White House. But whatever happens in the GOP presidential sweepstakes, he will stay a powerful force in Florida and likely continue to be prominent within national politics. That means all these donations could remain solid investments and hold their value.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the fundraising for his 2022 race or the transfer of funds from that effort to the super PAC now supporting his presidential bid.\n\nHere are the 313 donors who invested $100,000 or more in DeSantis during his 2022 reelection campaign:\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Florida Fires Worker Who Exposed Ron DeSantis' Plan to Bulldoze State Parks\n\nAt Honeymoon State Park, protesters including local resident Michelle Birnbaum gathered to oppose Gov. DeSantis' secretive \"Great Outdoors Initiative.\" Douglas R. Clifford/Tampa Bay Times via ZUMA Press Wire\n\nThis story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration .\n\nFlorida 's department of environmental protection has fired a whistleblower who exposed and sank governor Ron DeSantis ' secretive plan to pave over environmentally sensitive state parks and build lucrative hotels, golf courses, and pickleball courts.\n\nJames Gaddis, who worked for the agency for two years as a cartographer, was terminated for \"conduct unbecoming a public employee,\" according to a letter he received on Saturday.\n\nHis leaking of the proposals sparked a furious backlash that united Republicans with Democrats and environmental advocates, and forced DeSantis into a humiliating climbdown last week in which he admitted the plans were \"half-baked\" and were \"going back to the drawing board.\"\n\n\"I was directed to create nine maps depicting shocking and destructive infrastructure proposals.\"\n\nSpeaking with the Tampa Bay Times on Monday, Gaddis said preservation of the state parks was more important to him than his position. \"It was the absolute flagrant disregard for the critical, globally imperiled habitat in these parks,\" he said. \"This was going to be a complete bulldozing of all of that habitat. The secrecy was totally confusing and very frustrating. No state agency should be behaving like this.\"\n\nNews of his firing came as two Democratic state representatives pressed the agency about who was involved in drawing up plans that appeared to include no-bid contracts destined for mysteriously pre-chosen developers outside the requirements of Florida law.\n\n\"Firing a cartographer who had clear concerns about the process of this plan and the lack of transparency around it is 100 percent retaliatory,\" said Anna Eskamani, who wrote a joint letter to Shawn Hamilton, secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with fellow state congresswoman Angie Nixon.\n\n\"We want to not only hold the department accountable,\" she said, \"but our motivation is to learn more about how this happened in such a secretive way. Were they using a specific legislative process? Were there conversations that were meant to be public that weren't?\"\n\n\"Our intention is to prevent this from ever happening again, and that requires a better understanding of how it happened in the first place.\"\n\nThe hastily drawn proposals would have paved over thousands of acres of preserved land, Gaddis wrote.\n\nThe DEP did not immediately return a request for comment from the Guardian . In a statement to the Tampa Bay Times , a DEP spokesperson, Alex Kuchta, said the agency \"would not comment on personnel matters.\"\n\nKuchta was previously one of several DeSantis administration officials publicly defending or promoting the plans before the governor attempted on Wednesday to distance himself from them.\n\n\"It was not approved by me, I never saw that. It was intentionally leaked to a left-wing group to try and create a narrative,\" DeSantis told reporters. Political analysts, meanwhile, called the episode \" a totally self-inflicted political wound .\"\n\nIn a document he said he created in his own time, and which he sent to the Times , Gaddis explained how the proposals affecting nine state parks, and featuring 350-room hotels and the paving of thousands of acres of preserved land for recreation facilities, were drawn up in barely two weeks at the beginning of the month.\n\n\"I was directed to create nine maps depicting shocking and destructive infrastructure proposals, while keeping quiet as they were pushed through an accelerated and under-the-radar public engagement process,\" Gaddis wrote on a GoFundMe page he set up following his dismissal.\n\nHe said the DEP planned to hold short-notice, hour-long meetings at the nine parks simultaneously to announce the plans and minimize public comment.\n\nOther reasons given in the letter for Gaddis's termination were \"violation of law or department rules, negligence and misconduct,\" as well as providing \"inaccurate\" information. The letter did not specify what information Gaddis gave that was deemed to be inaccurate.\n\nGaddis spoke with a DEP attorney last week and admitted he was the author of the document that the Times used to break the story. He said he wrote it on his agency-issued laptop at home and worked on it alone. \"I've taken sole responsibility for this,\" said Gaddis, a single father with an 11-year-old daughter.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Gaddis's GoFundMe appeal, entitled \"an ethical whistleblower's new start,\" had surpassed $63,000, more than six times its initial target.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis Defends Florida's New Guidelines Suggesting Slavery Benefited Black People\n\nCharlie Neibergall/ AP\n\nIn a Sunday interview with NBC News, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stood by a new provision in the state's education guidelines that implied freed African-Americans benefited from chattel slavery, claiming it would teach students that enslaved people \"eventually parlayed , you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life.\"\n\n\"That means they developed skills in spite of slavery, not because of slavery,\" DeSantis added. \"It was them showing resourcefulness and then using those skills once slavery ended.\"\n\nThe remarks came as DeSantis also attempted to distance himself from the same provision. \"I didn't do it. I wasn't involved,\" he told NBC.\n\nLast month, Florida's Board of Education approved its new standards, including two controversial inclusions:\n\nAs I wrote at the time, the move added to Florida's ongoing efforts, under DeSantis' leadership, to water down Black history and other topics the governor and his conservative allies have deemed \"woke\" in Florida's curriculum.\n\nThe new guidelines suggesting that Black people benefited from slavery sparked outrage from Black leaders on both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).\n\n\"What slavery was really about was separating families, about mutilating humans and even raping their wives. It was just devastating,\" Scott, who is also running for the GOP presidential nomination, said at an Iowa event. \"So, I would hope that every person in our country, and certainly running for president, would appreciate that.\"\n\nDeSantis' defense of the provision comes as Republican voters appear to sour on the party's focus on culture wars. As my colleague Isabela Dias wrote this weekend, only 24 percent of national Republican voters sought \"a candidate who focuses on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture\" over \"a candidate who focuses on restoring law and order in our streets and at the border.\"\n\nThat's bad news for DeSantis, whose entire brand has relied on championing himself as a crusader against \"woke\" everything. One has to wonder what the Florida governor might have to offer beyond that.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nDeSantis is fighting hard to block a ballot initiative codifying abortion rights in Florida-so hard he's sent police to question people who signed a petition supporting the measure.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nFlorida governor and national embarrassment Ron DeSantis has found a new and terrifying way to violate the constitutional rights of his constituents. DeSantis usually aims at the 14th Amendment rights of Florida residents by denying equal protection of the laws to people who are gay, trans, or read books written by Black authors. But now, Governor Rain Boots is taking aim at the First Amendment by using state forces to chill the rights of free speech and free association.\n\nAccording to multiple reports , DeSantis has been using his Department of Election Crimes and Security-a task force he ordered the Florida legislature to create in 2022 to investigate the false and unfounded claims of voter fraud that Republicans like to make whenever people of color vote in ways that displease them-to accost Florida residents in their homes. The action that triggered DeSantis's ire appears to be a petition these residents signed to add Amendment 4 to the November ballot. Amendment 4 would codify the right to an abortion in Florida's Constitution. The amendment seeks to undo what DeSantis did when he signed a six-week abortion ban into law in Florida.\n\nPeople who have been harassed report that state police officers have shown up at their homes and asked if they signed the petition-and then required them to show state identification before the officers would leave. In at least one case, a person was asked if a family member had signed the petition and warned that the relatives could be the \"victim\" of identity fraud.\n\nThe DeSantis regime has taken other steps to undermine the proposed amendment, including posting a website stippled with misinformation about the amendment and writing a description of the measure -on the ballot itself-that claims, untruthfully, that it will harm the state's budget. It's always worth noting that these anti-choice Republicans are happy to force people to give birth against their will but unwilling to do anything to help women pay for the considerable expenses involved in being pregnant for nine months or raising a child for 18 years.\n\nRyan Ash, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State, told the Tampa Bay Times that the home visits are necessary because his office has \"uncovered evidence of illegal conduct with fraudulent petitions.\" He went on to say that the investigation-which is looking into whether some signatures were forged-would continue and that criminal referrals would be made.\n\nThus far, no actual evidence of signature fraud has been reported (of course). And DeSantis's track record is pathetic enough to raise serious questions about whether any will be. In 2022, DeSantis's new voter-intimidation task force arrested 20 people for allegedly committing voter fraud in Florida during the 2020 election. That's 20 people out of over 11 million votes cast. But here's the kicker: The government was unable to sustain prosecutions against most of the 20. It was all a stunt. It's always a stunt with these people.\n\nThe intimidation tactic at play here should be obvious, but since Republicans excel at feigned ignorance, I'll spell it out. Sending the police to the homes of people who signed a ballot petition is a way to discourage people from signing ballot petitions-or voting for the initiative once it's on the ballot. It's a way for the DeSantis administration to tell people that the government knows who they are and that they're being watched by the state.\n\nTelling family members that someone in their family signed a petition supporting abortion rights is also a way to discourage participation, but, more than that, it is a concerted government effort to \"out\" people and potentially make them victims of domestic violence.\n\nWhat DeSantis is doing should be considered a violation of the First Amendment. He's using the government to chill the free association of the people. If you happened to sign a petition for Amendment 4, the cops showed up at your house. But there have been no reports of the cops harassing people who signed a petition to get Amendment 2 on the Florida ballot; that amendment would establish a constitutional right to hunt and fish. The DeSantis administration is not investigating voter fraud; it's investigating people who support reproductive rights, and that should be a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nI say \"should\" be a violation because... who's going to tell DeSantis it is a violation of the First Amendment? Normally, it would be the courts. But the Florida State Supreme Court lives in his back pocket. The Supreme Court of the United States hates reproductive rights more than DeSantis does. The fact that DeSantis can do this is yet one more consequence of ceding the judicial branch of the government to Republican supermajorities for a generation.\n\nEven if the courts weren't already captured by the cult of forced-birth, though, getting this case in front of a court would be difficult. Arguably, the Department of Justice could-and should -sue DeSantis and Florida for violating both the First Amendment and the Voting Rights Act, as Florida's actions could be interpreted as voter intimidation. But saying \"the Department of Justice should sue\" is like saying \"I should practice meditation techniques and wellness before the election.\" It's true, but it's never going to happen. Merrick Garland let DeSantis get away with kidnapping migrants and shipping them across state lines like unwanted garbage. He's not going to do a thing to stop this.\n\nThe individual voters who've been questioned, or a civil liberties organization operating on their behalf, could also potentially sue. But it would not be an easy case. The legal test in First Amendment cases is whether the government is pursuing its legitimate interest in the \"least restrictive\" way. I'd say that sending police officers to people's homes to interrogate them about reproductive rights is not the \"least\" the government could be doing to suss out voter fraud-but I'm not a Republican judge, so my application of normal legal standards literally doesn't matter.\n\nAs for the voting rights violations, there are two problems. The first is that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing voter fraud, even though Republican claims of voter fraud are almost always illegitimate. The second is that most cases of voter intimidation are brought when something has been done to harass a person while they are voting or to confuse them or prevent them from voting at all. Again, I would entertain the argument that pre-voting harassment constitutes voter intimidation, but I'm not a Republican who shares Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society's aversion to democratic participation.\n\nAll of this means that DeSantis's latest experiment with antidemocratic fascism is likely to continue. The people of Florida will keep electing Republicans, and those Republicans will continue to use their power to violate the constitutional rights of the people of Florida.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nStill, Amendment 4 remains on the Florida ballot this November. If Democrats in the state simply show up to vote in record numbers for reproductive rights, they might also be able to vote out some of the Republicans who are trying to intimidate them. The best way to stop voter intimidation is to not be afraid-and to vote the bullies out.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

In the novel, as in Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation starring Christian Bale as Bateman, it's left unclear whether the sociopathic stockbroker actually acts on his vile fantasies or merely entertains them as a logical outgrowth of his antisocial worldview. The novel and movie remain hotly debated because of another ambiguity: Are they satirizing Bateman's pathological violence, or reveling in it? Whether a fantasist or a mass murderer, Bateman is utterly repulsive-at least to readers and viewers with a modicum of decency. Normally, anyone running for public office would not want voters to think of them as having anything in common with a necrophilic cannibal serial killer. But Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in his increasingly desperate and flailing bid to gain traction in the Republican presidential primary, has made the strange decision to embrace, elevate, and defend an ad where he is likened to Bateman. The ad was made by an anonymous DeSantis fan and retweeted by the DeSantis campaign on June 30. The argument of the ad is that Donald Trump was too friendly to LGBTQ rights, drawing a contrast with DeSantis, shown to be a relentless warrior against LGBTQ equality. After it was widely attacked, including by the conservative LGBT group Log Cabin Republicans, DeSantis defended the ad as making a valid point.

April 18, 2025 The political ideology of the ad, suggesting that even Trump's lip service to LGBTQ rights went too far, is repugnant. The ad quotes a DeSantis critic saying the governor has \"produced some of the harshest, most draconian laws that literally threaten trans existence.\" This accusation of having an eliminationist program is touted as an achievement. The ad's aesthetics are as disturbing as its politics.

He tweeted , \"This is actually very gay.\" In The New Republic , Robert Schlessinger convincingly explained the valorization of Bateman as a product of a specific niche culture, the \"manosphere,\" where anxiety about the decline of masculine authority fuels a celebration of macho strength in bodybuilding, a selective reading of ancient culture, and movies with rule-breaking antiheroes. As Schlessinger notes, \"In the decades since he cut his swath across the silver screen, Bale's satirical antihero has become an earnest hero in certain meme-ified, heavily male corners of the internet.\" Current Issue View our current issue Writing in Vice , Brad Esposito placed Bateman in the same category as \" Fight Club 's Tyler Durden, later joined by Jaoquin Phoenix's Joker and Leonardo DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort: a collection of lost toys that young men-in age or experience-use as watermarks for identity.\" The list of \"broken toys\" could be extended further to include the long line of goons and gangsters whom some people come to see as heroes to emulate: Michael Corleone in The Godfather films, Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas , and Tony Soprano on The Sopranos . There is often an element of comedy to such lawless protagonists. American Psycho , both the novel and movie, are best defended as works of satire. But the satirical impulse can go rancid when used to defend bigotry. Politico rightly describes the DeSantis ad as displaying an \"irony-laden variety of homophobia.\" The celebration of Bateman and other miscreants is a form of joking-not-joking, a use of irony to deflect criticism and analysis. In his classic book Anti-Semite and Jew (1944), Jean-Paul Sartre deftly observed that anti-Semites often resorted to the cloak of jokiness: Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. This \"right to play\" is the basis of much supposedly transgressive far-right humor that promotes bigotry with a wink and a nod. Rogue male antiheroes often charm the audience by being agents of disruption and disrespect, giving the raspberry to respectable society by acting on primal instincts that are necessarily repressed in ordinary life. When fused with right-wing politics, such criminal antiheroes allow those who uphold hierarchy and the status quo to adopt the more appealing pose of being a rebel.

Pretending to be Patrick Bateman isn't going to convince anyone that DeSantis is a macho man.\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\nApril 21, 2025\n\nApril 18, 2025\n\nThe political ideology of the ad, suggesting that even Trump's lip service to LGBTQ rights went too far, is repugnant. The ad quotes a DeSantis critic saying the governor has \"produced some of the harshest, most draconian laws that literally threaten trans existence.\" This accusation of having an eliminationist program is touted as an achievement. The ad's aesthetics are as disturbing as its politics. As Politico notes , the ad \"is \"just plain weird, a video that is largely unintelligible to someone who hasn't spent too many hours on the darker corners of the internet.\" Interspersed with images of a resolute DeSantis, sometimes displaying superpowers like the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, are clips of other supposedly admirable manly men. Along with Christian Bale as Bateman, we're shown Leonardo DiCaprio as stock market swindler Jordan Belfort (from the 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street ); Brad Pitt as the ancient Greek hero Achilles (from the 2004 movie Troy ); Cillian Murphy as the fictional gangster Thomas Shelby (from the British TV drama Peaky Blinders ); various body builders, including a meme of a sharply cleft muscleman known by the terminally online as GigaChad. The makers of Peaky Blinders condemned the use of their character in the ad.

There is often an element of comedy to such lawless protagonists. American Psycho , both the novel and movie, are best defended as works of satire. But the satirical impulse can go rancid when used to defend bigotry. Politico rightly describes the DeSantis ad as displaying an \"irony-laden variety of homophobia.\" The celebration of Bateman and other miscreants is a form of joking-not-joking, a use of irony to deflect criticism and analysis. In his classic book Anti-Semite and Jew (1944), Jean-Paul Sartre deftly observed that anti-Semites often resorted to the cloak of jokiness: Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. This \"right to play\" is the basis of much supposedly transgressive far-right humor that promotes bigotry with a wink and a nod. Rogue male antiheroes often charm the audience by being agents of disruption and disrespect, giving the raspberry to respectable society by acting on primal instincts that are necessarily repressed in ordinary life. When fused with right-wing politics, such criminal antiheroes allow those who uphold hierarchy and the status quo to adopt the more appealing pose of being a rebel.

In aligning himself with Patrick Bateman fanboys, DeSantis is not just challenging Trump but also trying to copy him. Unfortunately for DeSantis, Trump is a hard act to mimic. DeSantis is to Trump what Pat Boone was to rock and roll outlaws like Elvis: a pale, shallow imitation lacking in authenticity. That comparison is perhaps unfair to Boone, who at least had a singing voice. DeSantis is so far from the original that he comes across as not even Pat Boone but someone ineptly trying to sing a Boone song with a karaoke machine.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nThe Florida governor's presidential bid has already crashed and burned, but a major caucus defeat could finally get him off the campaign trail.\n\nRon DeSantis departs after speaking at meeting in Ankeny, Iowa, Friday, January 12, 2024.\n\nRon DeSantis is not going to be the Republican nominee for president in 2024. In fact, what once seemed like a promising bid to displace former president Donald Trump as the party's standard-bearer has failed so miserably that the governor of Florida may have dealt a permanent blow to his long-term presidential prospects.\n\nDeSantis has proven to be a uniquely uncomfortable, and seemingly unhappy candidate , since announcing his bid in May. Now, with his poll numbers dipping almost as rapidly as temperatures in the first-caucus state of Iowa, and collapsing in the first-primary state of New Hampshire, it's just a matter of time before his \"suspension of candidacy\" press conference.\n\nBut this hyper-ambitious if not hyper-competent candidate appears to be intent on delaying the inevitable.\n\nLike another relatively young Republican gubernatorial \"star,\" 2016 failure Scott Walker , the 45-year-old governor of Florida has run the wrong campaign in the wrong year. However, unlike Walker, who quit when it became clear that there was no way forward for his bid against Trump, DeSantis's ego is still getting the better of him. So it appears that he may require some career counseling from the Republicans who will come out in Iowa's snow and cold on Monday night to attend the caucuses that formally begin the GOP nominating process.\n\nDeSantis and his backers, who have poured millions of dollars into the Iowa campaign, are still scrambling to salvage something from the wreckage-in the form of a credible second-place finish behind Trump. But, if the latest polls are to be believed, the message from Des Moines and Dubuque could prove to be devastating for DeSantis.\n\nTrump looks to be headed for a big win. And DeSantis is still expected to finish second. But if he slips to third, behind former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, that would be a disaster for the Floridian. Without a major boost from the Hawkeye State, it's hard to see how DeSantis will be competitive when New Hampshire holds the first primary barely a week later, on January 23. One recent poll from New Hampshire-conducted before former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie quit the race -had Haley rising fast, while DeSantis was running fifth.\n\nLike Walker in 2016, DeSantis went into the 2024 race with a strategy that was all about Iowa, hoping that a strong start would power him through the rest of the race. DeSantis toured all 99 Iowa counties , on a grueling schedule that took him to some of the smallest towns in the state-like Nodaway, population 74, in southwest Iowa's Adams County, where, in a typically awkward moment, the candidate informed local farmers, \"In the winter, I think I could close my eyes and throw a dart and hit a Midwesterner on vacation.\" (Meanwhile, Trump was satisfied to hold higher-profile and better-attended rallies in the state's cities.)\n\nDeSantis has secured key endorsements, including that of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds , although the campaign was perhaps a little embarrassed last week by reports that PACS that back DeSantis had donated close to $100,000 to Iowa legislators who endorsed him. Now, in the final days before the primary, the candidate's aides and allies say he'll flood the caucuses with an army of 1,600 precinct captains for a final push that follows the classic model for winning in a state where grassroots organization still matters.\n\nBut basic appeal matters too-and the more Iowans have gotten to know DeSantis, polls suggest, the more they have been inclined to look for alternatives to his agonizingly predictable \"war on woke\" candidacy. Most Iowa Republicans appear to have settled on Trump. A November Des Moines Register poll gave Trump majority support-51 percent-as opposed to 19 percent for DeSantis. But since that bellwether survey came out, things have only gotten worse for the governor. The Real Clear Politics average of the most recent Iowa polls has Trump moving up to 52.2 percent, while DeSantis, at 16.4 percent, has fallen ever so narrowly behind Haley, who has jumped to 16.6 percent.\n\nUnlike DeSantis, Haley never put all her eggs in the Iowa basket. She staked her bid on a strong showing in New Hampshire, which she now appears likely to get. CNN's latest New Hampshire poll had Trump at 39 percent among likely Republican primary voters, while Haley was at 32 percent. Christie, who focused on New Hampshire before his departure from the race, was at 12 percent, while entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy was at 8 percent. DeSantis had a dismal 5 percent. Christie's exit is likely to give a further boost to Haley in the Granite State.\n\nHaley has surged so significantly-in New Hampshire and in national polls -that her standing in Iowa has also risen. She now looks to be highly competitive in the real race in the Hawkeye State: a contest for second-place that's expected to help settle the argument about which contender has even a remote chance of stopping Trump. That's very bad news for DeSantis, who desperately needs an Iowa boost to resuscitate his campaign in New Hampshire and other states that he has neglected in order to make his way to places\n\nDeSantis's declining appeal put him in a tough position going into last Wednesday night's final debate with Haley. The headlines said it all: \"Haley's got the momentum-as well as the spotlight,\" chirped Politico , while the Associated Press explained that the debate \"could help decide the Republican alternative to Trump.\"\n\nActually, Iowa Republicans will do that, and DeSantis hasn't given up on them.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nHe went into the debate in attack mode, focusing on a suggestion Haley made at a New Hampshire event when she was still assuming DeSantis would run ahead of her in Iowa. \"You know how to do this,\" she said . \"You know Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it.\" The line has come back to haunt the South Carolinian as her position in Iowa has strengthened.\n\nThe problem for DeSantis, however, is that he's losing the margin of error that might allow for a correction in his favor. If Haley beats him in Iowa, there's no credible argument for him to carry on in New Hampshire, a state where he trails her by 27 points. If he crawls across the finish line ahead of Haley in Iowa, then she-and Trump-will trounce him eight days later in New Hampshire.\n\nEither way, Ron DeSantis finishes the race not as the nominee but as the Scott Walker of 2024.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Twice-impeached Donald Trump never found a nickname that stuck to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. And you might think that made DeSantis a strong rival for the presidential nomination against Trump. But you'd be wrong. Heading into the New Hampshire primary, Florida Man pulled a U-turn and left the race Sunday, multiple nicknames and all. I think the fact that Trump never found a moniker to stick was part of Tiny D's problem. What did he stand for? What did he care about? Could you pick him out of a lineup? Ronnie, we hardly knew ye. I'm neck deep in a long feature about whether the 2024 GOP presidential primary could have turned out any other way besides the likely re-coronation of Trump (There's still time! Not really but...!) And everyone who indulges me in what one GOP adviser called \"fan fiction\" says the only possibility at all goes back to the end of 2022, when Republicans botched the midterm and DeSantis loomed. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 DeSantis won his reelection overwhelmingly. Meanwhile, Trump's 2022 picks for Senate, House, and governor-remember Kari Lake, Blake Masters, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Doug Mastriano, Herschel Walker, and Sarah Palin-all lost winnable purple seats. DeSantis looked indomitable. Trump looked... sad. So eventually (some admirers say he waited too long) DeSantis declared he was running . It was all downhill from there. Not being a GOP primary voter, I always pause before suggesting reasons a Republican failed. But I think DeSantis's big problem was that he is deeply unlikable. Also: He doesn't seem to like people. He botched so many easy layups on the campaign trail. He utterly blew his campaign launch trying to win over Elon Musk. I could say: Don't get into a fight with Mickey Mouse! Or any Disney characters! Take the debate this month in which DeSantis claimed Disney was involved in \"transing kids.\" Who wanted that fight, Meatball Ron? And what did it even mean? Current Issue View our current issue I displayed my best attempt at fairness in covering his one-on-one debate with Haley . I praised his only praiseworthy statement: coming out against cutting benefits or raising the eligibility age for Social Security: \"I don't see how you can raise the retirement age when life expectancy is going down,\" he said. Good on ya, Ron. Then Haley noted that DeSantis voted to raise the retirement age back when he was in Congress. That's what these louts are all about. Before I began this piece, I started writing about how deranged racist Donald Trump began calling Nikki Haley a bastardized version of her name Nimarata (\" Nimbra \") Saturday and then arguably said worse: He blamed her twice for security failures during the January 6 insurrection. Smarter people than me knew he was confusing Haley with and falsely blaming then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I guess. Both things sound equally bizarre. But Florida Man got Trump off the hook, once again. At least temporarily, he obscured his crazy rambling about Haley. Oh, and he even endorsed him, in case you were wondering. I wasn't, which is why I tucked this in here, when I was basically finished writing. This is how it will all go from here on in-even when Haley drops out after losing New Hampshire, as she almost certainly will.\n\nTwice-impeached Donald Trump never found a nickname that stuck to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

But these credentials have not stopped the Republican presidential contender from spewing out a toxic slurry of ignorant bigotry regarding the Palestinian men, women, and children who have been forced to flee from Israel's \"complete siege\" of Gaza.\n\nIn a CBS Face the Nation interview regarding the conflict, which has seen thousands of Israelis and Palestinians die since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israeli kibbutizim and a music festival, DeSantis refused to say-as a former Navy Judge Advocate General Corps legal adviser-that he'd advise that Israel's massive assault on Gaza should be doing more to distinguish between legitimate military targets and civilians. He declined to call for the Israeli military to avoid attacking essential infrastructure for the 2.4 million Palestinians living in Gaza. And he declared that, because Hamas is holding Israeli and American hostages in Gaza, \"I don't think [the Israelis are] under an obligation to be providing water and these utilities while those hostages are being held\"-despite the fact that the denial of food, water, and electricity has created a humanitarian crisis that's recognized by the United Nations, aid agencies and many responsible Israelis. Asked about the devastating impact of Israel's bombing of civilian targets in Gaza, which has now left an estimated 1,000 children dead, DeSantis said , \"It's not a collective punishment.\"\n\nIt is impossible to deny that life in Gaza, a place that even conservatives such as former British Prime Minister David Cameron have described as the world's largest open-air \"prison camp,\" is a living hell right now. But DeSantis seems determined to avoid that reality. He has also made it abundantly clear that he has zero sympathy for innocent families who are trying to survive in Gaza-or who are trying to get out. On the campaign trail in Iowa last week, the governor announced , \"We cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees. I am not going to do that. If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all anti-Semitic.\"\n\nFace the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan pressed DeSantis on the intellectual and practical dishonesty of his statement. \"I'm sure you know, all Arabs are Semites,\" said the chief foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News when she spoke with the candidate on Sunday. \"But how can you paint with such a broad brush to say 2.3 million people are anti-Semitic?\"\n\nInstead of acknowledging that Brennan had called him out on a basic reality of the region about which he was ranting and raving, DeSantis simply pressed ahead. \"Well, first of all, my position is very clear,\" he said. \"Those [from] Gaza are refugees, Palestinian Arabs should go to Arab countries. The US should not be absorbing any of those.\" Why? \"[They] elected Hamas, let's just be clear about that.\"\n\nLet's unpack these statements from DeSantis.\n\nFirst, as Brennan pointed out to the governor, Palestinians, like other Arabs, are Semites. The Encyclopedia Britannica staff explains that \"Semite\" is the \"name given in the 19th century to a member of any people who speak one of the Semitic languages, a family of languages spoken primarily in parts of western Asia and Africa. The term therefore came to include Arabs, Akkadians, Canaanites, Hebrews, some Ethiopians (including the Amhara and the Tigrayans), and Aramaean tribes.\"\n\nIndeed, in the 1950s, a small group of Israelis and Palestinians formed Semitic Action , an organization that for many years argued for Arabs and Israelis to unite in opposition to the colonial powers of Europe. (It has been revived in recent years by younger activists.)\n\nOne of the leading figures in the original group was Uri Avnery , who went on to serve three terms in the Israeli Knesset and famously met with Yasser Arafat in 1982. At that historic meeting, Avnery told the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, \"Our two peoples will in the end find a solution.\" Ultimately, said Avnery, \"There will be a Palestinian state and there will be a state of Israel and the two people will peacefully live together in two states that slowly become not only good neighbors but more than this.\"\n\nMany Israelis and Palestinians still keep the faith that a path to peace might be found. Polling in Gaza from July of this year found that 62 percent of Gazans favored a continued cease-fire with Israel and at least half of Gazans agreed that \"Hamas should stop calling for Israel's destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.\" That doesn't mean there aren't people in Gaza who entertain anti-Semitic thoughts about Israeli Jews, just as there are anti-Semitic haters in the United States. But it does suggest that there are people on all sides of the divide between Israel and Palestine who want peace and justice.\n\nAvnery recognized that reality in 1982, a year when Israel invaded southern Lebanon and tensions flared throughout the region. And he kept the faith until his death in 2018 at age 94.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nThat was because he believed, as an Israeli, that there were Palestinians he could talk with, negotiate with, and ultimately develop peace agreements with. It is still the case that there are Israelis and Palestinians who are ready to pursue peace. And it is still the case that there must be Americans who support that pursuit.\n\nThat's what makes DeSantis's sweeping claims so troubling. He wants Americans to imagine that Gaza and Hamas are pretty much synonymous-hence the line: \"They elected Hamas.\"\n\nThe problem with the governor's false premise is that \"they\"-the vast majority of the people who are being bombed, denied water, and collectively punished in Gaza-didn't elect Hamas. The last elections in Palestine took place in 2006 , when Hamas won 44 percent of the vote. Under the complex election system that had been devised, Hamas took a majority of parliamentary seats. But there have been no elections since then. Roughly half of Gaza's population is under the age of 18 , and the overwhelming majority of Gazans are under the age of 35. None of them voted for Hamas or any other political party in 2006.\n\nSo Desantis was off the mark when he said \" They elected Hamas.\" And it would be equally off the mark to assume that they would elect Hamas in a new election. For most of the last decade, polls have shown that the vast majority of Gazans-70 percent in the most recent Washington Institute poll -would prefer that the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, take charge of Gaza. Moreover, the basic idea that civilians can be legitimate targets of war based on whom they voted for is not one that should be seriously entertained.\n\nYou would think that someone seeking the presidency would be up to speed on the basic realities of the Middle East. But DeSantis is either actually ignorant or willfully promoting ignorance. So much so that his fellow Republican contenders recognized the absurdity of the Floridian's remarks, even as they generally embraced his anti-refugee politics. \"I don't think that they're all anti-Semitic. I just can't tell you who's who,\" said South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. Former president Donald Trump, no friend of refugees, proposed \"ideological screening\" of immigrants in order to prevent Hamas supporters from entering the country. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley brought a more moderate line to the debate, saying, \"America's always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists. And that's what we have to do.\"\n\nDeSantis doesn't seem to mind being the most extreme candidate on the question. He's struggling to maintain a presidential bid that was once seen as a serious threat to Trump's front-runner status-but is now so diminished that polls from the first primary state of New Hampshire have him trailing Haley .\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time that DeSantis has tried to ride bigotry and lies to political success. But we're in a moment where his ignorance-whether sincere or feigned-is \"incredibly destructive and dangerous,\" as US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) put it.\n\nReferencing the killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume , a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy who was stabbed to death on Saturday by a Chicago-area landlord-who authorities said targeted the family because they are Muslim, spurred by the Hamas attack- AOC said , \"We just had a 6-year-old boy stabbed 26 times this morning because of rhetoric like that\" peddled by DeSantis.\n\n\"It is dangerous, it is unacceptable, it is reckless,\" said Ocasio-Cortez, \"and no leader in the United States of America should be amplifying a message like that.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nAt last night's Fox News debate, even a home field advantage couldn't keep the aspiring presidential candidate from choking.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Florida Governor Ron DeSantis speaks on September 16, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa, and California Governor Gavin Newsom, speaks on September 12, 2023, in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nTwo-thirds of the way through Thursday's much-hyped debate between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, moderated by Fox News's Sean Hannity and held in Alpharetta, Ga., the conversation turned to book banning. This was DeSantis's terrain, his political bread and butter. Theatrically, DeSantis removed from his jacket pocket pages from the controversial book Gender Queer , which depicts a variety of sex acts in ways that leave, well, nothing to the imagination. The book was, the governor declared forcefully, pure \"pornography,\" and it was being peddled to young kids in states like California, via out-of-control sex education classes. By contrast, DeSantis said, he had taken measures to ensure that elementary school children weren't subjected to such filth in their classrooms.\n\nThis was the sort of gotcha moment the conservative Fox crowd loves, one loaded with political peril for a progressive governor such as Newsom. Had there been an in-studio audience, which, thankfully, there wasn't, it would likely have started booing the moment the Californian stood up to respond. Defend the book-which is indeed full of explicit imagery-too aggressively, and Newsom risked being seen as wildly out of touch with Middle America. Back off, however, and he risked coming across as weak, unwilling to stand his ground on matters of principle.\n\nGovernor Newsom claims not to have presidential ambitions in this election cycle, but earlier this year he put $10 million into a political action committee that in part is campaigning to win over voters in red states, and he is increasingly seen as having established a shadow campaign ready to launch should the aging and increasingly unpopular Biden decide to call it a day. And last night, he handled DeSantis's stunt with aplomb. First, he listed many of the other literary works under attack in Florida-by authors such as the acclaimed novelist Toni Morrison and Amanda Gorman, the young African American poet who read at President Biden's inauguration. Fully 1,406 books, he told viewers, were the targets of book-banners in Florida, and most of them had none of the ribald imagery displayed on the pages DeSantis had pulled up out of his pocket. And then, not for the first or last time in the 90-minute confrontation, the telegenic 56-year-old politician went on the attack. \"I don't like the way you demean people,\" he said angrily, looking squarely at his rival. \"I don't like the way you demean the LGBTQ community, Ron.\"\n\nA few minutes later, as DeSantis unleashed a blistering verbal salvo on Newsom's record in tackling homelessness in the Golden State, the California governor looked at the Floridian again and put on his best laid-back Californian air: \"Ron, relax. I can handle it. I'm used to bullies. You're nothing but a bully.\" He raised his arms and smiled disarmingly. DeSantis cringed, visibly. Astoundingly, he seemed caught off-guard by Newsom's debating tactics. He looked, in that moment, like an outmaneuvered younger sibling, left at the mercy of an older and more dynamic older brother.\n\nWhen DeSantis went after another supposed Achilles' heel for Newsom and the Democrats-the large numbers of people crossing the southern border illegally and then claiming asylum-Newsom again went on the attack. He accused his opponent of gamesmanship, of having once backed the principle of amnesty for undocumented residents and of tacking to the right solely to try to woo an extremist base. He pointed out that, while Biden has presented immigration reform plans to Congress, Congress itself has stymied all efforts to legislate change. Its members have instead largely just stood back while governors such as DeSantis have pulled a wave of stunts, including flying asylum seekers north to Martha's Vineyard . \"You're trying to out-Trump Trump,\" Newsom said. And then came the dagger between the shoulder blades: \"By the way, how's that going for you, Ron? You're down 41 points in your own state.\"\n\nThere was a lot of shouting in this debate, and for much of the time the two governors were talking over each other so much that it was impossible to hear what either was saying. There was also an abundance of misleading information on both sides. Yet, at the same time-and yes, I realize it's a low bar-it was a far more substantive debate than the GOP contests from the past few months. With only two contenders and moderator Hannity in the studio, there was room for real policies to be discussed and for a genuine ideological back-and-forth to take place.\n\nOn paper, the format, and the fact that Sean Hannity is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, should have benefited DeSantis. Hannity was only too happy to trot out head-to-head data to viewers: indicating that the number of homeless in California, as a percentage of the population, was three and a half times that in Florida; that California's violent crime rate was far higher than the national average, while Florida's was far lower; that three-quarters of a million people left California during the pandemic, while nearly half a million migrated to Florida; that the tax burden on Floridians is lower than the burden on Californians; that Florida's unemployment rate is 2.8 percent and California's 4.8 percent. With the moderator's collaboration, DeSantis was able to paint Florida in a very favorable light compared to its Western rival.\n\nAnd yet, despite both unleashing a number of zingers at Newsom and pointing to real economic accomplishment in Florida, DeSantis struggled to gain purchase. By the end of the evening, it was the Californian who walked away having scored the most points. As he defended both his state's record and Biden's federal accomplishments, he seemed relaxed; in contrast, DeSantis spent much of the evening twisting his face into ever-more-forced grimaces, perhaps realizing that this wasn't going to be the home- run-filled evening that he desperately needed in order to rescue his flailing presidential campaign.\n\nThere are a number of credible Democrats waiting in the wings should Biden decide to retire, including Illinois's wealthy Governor J.B. Pritzker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. But it is Newsom who has, in recent months, most methodically planted himself on center stage in national politics. Thursday's debate showcased his ability to defend California's record-even its less positive aspects-by relentlessly forcing the issue against his opponent. Not once did he back down; not once did he show hesitation. It's a trait that will serve him well should he ever have the opportunity to take on Donald Trump in next year's race for the White House.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

He humiliates and obliterates them.\n\nIn the brutal game of politics, autopsies are often conducted while the patient is still alive. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis only ended his presidential bid on Sunday, but the stench of decay and mortality followed his campaign for many months, as he faltered in the polls and was mercilessly mocked by front-runner Donald Trump. Well before DeSantis threw in the towel, journalists at NBC and The Washington Post had run lengthy postmortems of the infighting and incompetence that allegedly hamstrung the candidate from the start. My Nation colleague Joan Walsh waited for DeSantis's announcement suspending his campaign before delivering her own efficient and slashing rebuke . By all these accounts, DeSantis was doomed even before he announced his candidacy by a mixture of indecisiveness, poor strategic planning, and lack of a coherent message.\n\nTo the extent that DeSantis's failure smooths the path for Trump's inevitable coronation, it's to be regretted. But DeSantis was never a Trump alternative in any meaningful sense. The whole logic of his candidacy was that he was Trump without the baggage-someone who could carry out Trump's agenda in a more competent and forceful way than the former president. To that end, DeSantis styled for himself a political persona of cold, calculated bigotry that was singularly loathsome. DeSantis allied himself with the homophobes and transphobes of Moms for Liberty to sign many wide-ranging anti-LGBTQ+ laws designed to make life miserable for sexual minorities in Florida. He targeted black voters for disenfranchisement in a reversion to the dark history of Jim Crow. He placed the state's colleges and universities -particularly the New College of Florida-in the hands of far-right ideological fanatics intent on destroying intellectual freedom and efforts to promote racial diversity. In a particularly vile stunt, he turned migrants into political props by having them transported from Florida to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nAs Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch concluded , \"It's so tempting to pile on the Ron DeSantis jokes but I keep thinking about the Black voters he had arrested, the kids who had to leave New College, the migrants he tricked onto that plane-all for the sake of the worst campaign in American history.\" There's no reason to mourn DeSantis's epic failure.\n\nDeSantis's early defeat is remarkable given the lavish amount of money and media support he received from GOP plutocrats. By last September big donors had given his campaign more than $23 million-far more than to any other Republican candidate. Because moneyed DeSantis donors quickly ran into the limits of campaign finance law, his campaign relied heavily on the Never Back Down super PAC, funded to the tune of more than $130 million by last fall.\n\nNBC's dissection on DeSantis's collapse emphasizes the logistical problems caused by the campaign's lopsided dependency on funding from billionaires. Under campaign laws, campaigns aren't allowed to coordinate with outside groups such as Never Back Down. The DeSantis campaign allegedly played fast and loose with these rules, because the super PAC was where the money was. Aside from the coordination problem, the big donors who made up the backbone of DeSantis's support soured on the candidate's heavy emphasis on red-meat culture-war politics. They preferred a more old-style Republican emphasis on austerity and foreign policy hawkishness. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott initially benefited from this re-funneling of money, although the donor class eventually settled on Nikki Haley, who goes forward as the last viable alternative to Trump.\n\nThe NBC account documents many more strategic failures: the fecklessness of Scott Wagner, the CEO of Never Back Down, who spent time in the crucial days before the Iowa caucus assembling a jigsaw puzzle; the reluctance to launch DeSantis's campaign quickly after his 2022 reelection as Florida governor; a social media strategy that involved elevating and catering to cranks (including a staffer who promoted a video using Nazi imagery ); an ill-advised decision to launch the campaign on a glitchy Twitter platform; overspending in the early weeks of the campaign that quickly depleted resources and led to staffing layoffs; an ill-conceived focus on door-to-door canvassing of rural voters, rather than the suburban Republicans who were more receptive to a Trump-skeptical message.\n\nThe Washington Post offers a parallel litany of maladministration. According to the newspaper, \"From the beginning, the effort was hobbled by major miscalculations, competing advisers, wooden interactions with voters and a series of indictments against the former president that DeSantis could not control.\"\n\nThe point about \"a series of indictments\" hints at the true problem, which cuts closer to the core rationale of DeSantis's run and went well beyond the haphazard mistakes that bedevil all campaigns. Normally, having a rival who was under more than 90 indictments for serious crimes would be good for a candidate.\n\nBut the Republican electorate was so enamored of Donald Trump that the more often he was indicted the stronger he became in polling in the primaries. The reason is simple: Trump's core political identity is as an anti-system politician-an outsider who upsets the applecart of the status quo. When he's indicted, that's just further proof that the system is out to get him.\n\nDeSantis's big problem was that the GOP electorate loves Trump as the great avatar of their hatred of the political status quo (which they see as beholden to powerful and devious liberal elites). Give this electorate, did it ever make sense to run as \"Trump-but more politically adept and administratively competent\"? It's precisely Trump's opposition to the norms of normal politics and administrative knowledge that makes him appealing. Running as \"Trump-but competent\" is like trying to create a rock star that is \"Elvis-but chaste and subdued.\" It reflects a misunderstanding of the product being sold.\n\nOne manifestation of Trump's anti-system politics is that he doesn't want to just defeat his rivals; he wants to humiliate them so they stand exposed as craven and weak. Consider the nicknames he gives them: Little Marco (Rubio); Lyin' Ted (Cruz), Liddle Mike Pence, and Ron DeSanctimonious. These childish gibes are especially harmful to Republicans, because they eventually have to eat their pride and endorse Trump if they want any role in the party's future. In the case of Cruz, the fact that Trump accused Cruz's father of being involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination (and called Cruz's wife ugly) hasn't stopped Cruz from become a particularly servile lapdog of Trumpism.\n\nLast Sunday, DeSantis commented on Trump's bullying by telling an Iowa crowd , \"You can be the most worthless Republican in America. But if you kiss the ring, he'll say you're wonderful.\" The governor then added , \"You can be the strongest, most dynamic, successful Republican and conservative in America ― but if you don't kiss that ring, then he'll try to trash you.\"\n\nExactly one week after these damning words, DeSantis endorsed Trump.

Activate your online access\n\nThe governor of Florida is on a 2024 trajectory that mirrors the former governor of Wisconsin's doomed 2016 campaign.\n\nA brand new Rasmussen Reports survey has Florida Governor Ron DeSantis polling at just 13 percent in the race for the Republican presidential nomination- 44 points behind Donald Trump . Despite Trump's mounting legal troubles, the embattled former president has gained 10 points since the last Rasmussen poll, while DeSantis has lost seven.\n\nCould it get any worse for DeSantis? Yes.\n\nA Harvard-Harris poll , which like the Rasmussen poll was released on Monday, has DeSantis falling to just 12 percent with Republican voters nationwide-40 points behind Trump and just two points ahead of political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nWhen the governor of Florida launched his presidential campaign two months ago, he positioned himself as a political \" giant killer \" whose \" war on woke \" crusade would displace Trump and secure the Republican Party's 2024 nomination.\n\nBut, with each passing week, the governor of Florida is looking more and more like what Trump called him over the weekend: \"a loser.\"\n\nDeSantis is shedding staff, struggling to gain traction in critical caucus and primary states, and making billionaire donors nervous about writing more checks to a campaign that has been burning through cash so fast that The New York Times recently observed , \"DeSantis is spending hand over fist, and his dependence on large donors suggests a lack of grassroots support.\"\n\nOnce heralded by the mainstream media as the alternative to Trump, DeSantis is now taking a pounding in the press. \"DeSantis Can't Shake Trump's Long Shadow,\" warns U.S. News and World Report. \"There Is No Ron DeSantis 2.0,\" asserts Politico in a dismal assessment of prospects for a campaign reset. The Atlantic simply notes \"The Humiliation of Ron DeSantis.\"\n\nThis all sounds oddly familiar to those of us who chronicled the rise and fall of another GOP \"star\" who imagined that a reputation as a headline-grabbing Republican governor, along with a penchant for mouthing social-conservative dogma, would be enough to win a Republican presidential nomination.\n\nEight years ago this summer, Scott Walker was the hottest commodity in GOP politics. The recently reelected governor of Wisconsin had joined the 2016 presidential field with a splashy announcement that drew the national press corps to an exposition center amid the suburban sprawl of what was then a reliably Republican county. Walker went live that night with Sean Hannity on Fox News-attacking \"lame ideas\" from \"the left\" such as the minimum wage . The next morning, images of the 47-year-old career politician plunging into a crowd of seemingly enthusiastic supporters were splashed across the front pages of the nation's newspapers, as The New York Times reported that Walker would cast himself as a cultural conservative \"who would defend the 'unborn,' the Americans who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds, and more broadly the conservative and traditional citizens who feel under attack from what they consider coastal elites.\"\n\nRepublican operatives assured reporters that the Wisconsinite had what it took to grab the GOP nod and take back the White House from President Barack Obama's Democrats. Walker, South Carolina Republican Party chair Matt Moore announced, had \"rocketed to the top tier of candidates.\" A Reuters analysis noted that \"a resume that appeals to conservatives\" had \"placed him among the top contenders for his party's nomination in poll after poll.\" In Iowa, he led surveys of likely Republican participants in the state's first-in-the-nation caucuses. In New Hampshire, the first primary state, headlines reported that Walker was \"surging.\"\n\nBut, within weeks of its formal launch, there were signs that Walker's campaign was unraveling . There were money problems. Staffing problems. Messaging problems. And Donald Trump problems, which surfaced when the political newcomer shredded Walker in debates. By September, just two months after he started running, Walker's poll numbers had tanked to roughly zero. He quit the race with a feeble call for Republicans to unite against Trump and then, when political reality finally dawned on him, repositioned himself as a Trump enthusiast.\n\nDefeated for reelection in 2018, Walker is now in the business of giving vapid advice to losing political candidates . He even has a tip for DeSantis: \"light a fire with primary and caucus voters with some really bold ideas.\" Walker doesn't have an actual plan for DeSantis; just a word salad of political happy talk. The failed governor turned presidential candidate of 2015 says the failed governor turned presidential candidate of 2023 needs to \"be lean and, at the same time, he needs to go bold. I know this firsthand.\"\n\nWhile Walker's practical advice is trite-what candidate doesn't want to \"be lean\" and \"go bold\"? -he's right about his area of expertise.\n\nFew Republicans know so much about getting beaten to a political pulp by Trump as Walker. But DeSantis is rapidly accumulating his own \"firsthand knowledge\" of how to tank a campaign for the Republican presidential nod.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

      "text": "What Is Ron DeSantis Doing to Florida's Public Liberal-Arts College?\n\nIn the context of other universities-the sort of assessment the Princeton Review's guidebooks might do-New College of Florida, situated on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, a few miles north of downtown Sarasota, has a number of standout features. Its curriculum is unusually self-directed: it gives out no letter grades, and has an academic research project built around independent study in partnership with professors. Two-thirds of its seven hundred students are women, and there is a prominent queer community; in the past, New College ranked among the most \"gay-friendly\" campuses in the country. Those attributes make it seem like a progressive northern liberal-arts college, to which alumni often compare it, but New College is a public school, which means that in-state tuition costs under seven thousand dollars annually-a bargain-and also that it is subject to the influence of Florida's state politics.\n\nEarly in January, the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis , announced that he would be making six new appointments to New College's Board of Trustees, and, weeks later, the Florida Board of Governors appointed a seventh, which gave DeSantis's incoming choices an immediate majority on the board. DeSantis's chief of staff, James Uthmeier, told National Review that he hoped New College would become a \"Hillsdale of the South\"-a reference to the private, Christian conservative college in Michigan. Shortly afterward, Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist and one of DeSantis's new appointments to New College's board, gave an interview to the Times ' Michelle Goldberg that was even more pointed: he spoke of a \"top-down restructuring\" of the school's curriculum and culture, and suggested that if professors and students weren't in line with the changes, they could leave. The project, Rufo went on, could serve as a model for similar takeovers around the country. \"If we can take this high-risk, high-reward gambit and turn it into a victory, we're going to see conservative state legislators starting to reconquer public institutions all over the United States,\" he said.\n\nFor the past few years, DeSantis's culture-war campaigns have operated in American politics like a spooling synth loop: it keeps coming around. The Governor of Florida has sought to suspend the Walt Disney Corporation's tax breaks because the company opposed his \" Don't Say Gay \" bill; has moved to limit what teachers can say in public school classrooms about race and gender, and what books can be available in libraries; has encouraged state police to arrest and prosecute ex-felons for voting; and has flown migrants to Martha's Vineyard as a political stunt . These campaigns have raised an enormous political war chest for DeSantis, and helped give him a regular perch on Fox News. But what distinguishes DeSantis from other culture warriors, especially in the eyes of conservative intellectuals, is that he not only uses his profile to inveigh against progressive control of institutions but also his powers as governor to remake them. After Rufo made his comments about New College to the Times , he called DeSantis's aides. \"I was, like, 'Man, did I go too far?' \" Rufo told me recently. \"They were, like, 'No, it's great. Keep going.' \"\n\nRufo, a documentary filmmaker and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has had one of the most dynamic trajectories of any conservative intellectual over the past few years, having been at the center of the right-wing campaign against critical race theory , which is what initially drew him into DeSantis's orbit. He has since consulted with the Florida Governor on the Stop WOKE Act and aided DeSantis's campaign against Disney by writing articles about its theme parks employing dozens of pedophilic sex predators and indoctrinating their employees with diversity politics. (A Disney spokesperson said that insuring \" a safe environment for children and families is a responsibility\" the company takes \"very seriously.\") Rufo seemed to see his arrival in Sarasota as an event unto itself: he had with him an aide, a cameraman, and a security guard-a large, loping, bearded guy, who, Rufo told me, had been a golden-glove boxer in Ohio-which seemed an extreme precaution for a conservative trustee visiting the campus of a hippie college.\n\nBut Rufo's arrival was hard for the New Collegers to dismiss. DeSantis had just won a large majority by running on aggressively defending social conservatism. Florida's constitution and laws gave him the power to assert control over its public universities. Rufo explained to me the story, as he saw it. New College was a struggling campus. The most recent data shows that it accepted seventy-five per cent of students who applied, but enrolled only thirteen per cent of those who were accepted. Twenty per cent of students dropped out before the end of their first year; a third were not employed or in graduate school a year after they got their degree; and, of those who were employed, the median salary was thirty-two thousand dollars. The source of these failures, Rufo went on, was a culture that valued protest and activism over work. Consultants' reports found that the top words students associated with New College's culture were \"politically correct,\" \"druggies,\" and \"weirdos.\" The environment had become a problem, he said. \"The trustees need to reëstablish authority.\"\n\nI asked for details about how the curriculum would change. \"I'm the narrative guy, the political guy,\" Rufo told me, waving off the question. \"I'm a soldier in DeSantis's army.\" The sun was setting over the Gulf, leaving just a fuzzy pink line on the horizon. To our south, past downtown Sarasota, were the rich, beachy hubs of Longboat and Siesta Keys, with day-drunk strips of restaurants and residential roads that tracked the shore; most of the houses had a dock with a big boat out back. This has long been politically conservative territory; now it's DeSantis country. \"This is really a brilliant strategy on behalf of the Governor to say, we are losing our democratic control of these institutions because we aren't using our democratic power at all,\" Rufo said. \"Let's actually use the power of the Board of Trustees in the way that it was intended, in a way that is authorized in the Constitution, to turn political will into institutional outcomes. New board, new trustees, new majority, new vision. It's either turn around or shut down.\"\n\nThe next morning, Rufo and another new DeSantis-appointed trustee, Jason (Eddie) Speir, who co-founded and is the superintendent of  a Christian school in Bradenton, held a public Q. & A. session with New College's faculty and staff. (Someone had e-mailed the University threatening Speir just beforehand, and the Sarasota Police and campus administration had tried to cancel the event, only for Rufo and Speir to overrule them.) Rufo was challenged about whether he thought members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community were a threat to campus life. At one point, Rufo responded, \"We should have a unified standard by which we treat people fairly. Identity-based preferences are policies that I strongly disagree with.\" Mostly, though, the faculty tried to defend the curriculum. One reason that so many students quit after their first year, someone suggested, might be that New College was a very specific educational environment, and they hadn't realized what they were getting into. Amid a generally tense conversation, some members of the faculty seemed to be searching for \"where we can find common ground, particularly around the ideals of a liberal arts education,\" as one history professor put it.\n\nThe academics in the audience might not have much liked Rufo-might even, in many cases, have feared what he represented-but there was no confusion: he was prepared and aggressive and camera-ready, a facsimile of DeSantis himself. Nearly all the questions went to him. Speir, buff and bearded, with a spacey manner and an elliptical speaking style that at times scanned as Christian and at others as stoner, was somewhat harder to fathom. He spent a couple of minutes detailing his complaints with his treatment at the hands of the local Sarasota paper, and his failed efforts to suspend the \"unwelcoming\" comments section. Later in the day, at a meeting with students, Speir spoke out in favor of increasing the number of Christian students on campus. When he was asked whether he favored open carry on campus, he said that \"we cannot sacrifice our freedoms for safety.\"As a conciliatory gesture to the faculty, Speir acknowledged that his own school's philosophy was designed to be self-directed in a way somewhat similar to New College's, but he also kept hinting that the Governor would send more money if the campus were to \"go along\" with the imminent changes.\n\nAt one point, when a student accused Rufo of being anti-science, Speir took out his microphone and said, \"If there's somebody that would be anti-science, that would be me.\" He mentioned a social-media thread he had made, questioning whether the Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest after being slammed in the chest on the field, owed his near-death experience to the fact that he had taken the COVID -19 vaccine. \"I think questions need to be asked. I think that's the beginning of science,\" Speir said. (The following week, Speir would propose that the new Board of Trustees summarily fire every single faculty member-most of them unionized and most of them with tenure-by asking the Florida legislature to authorize a \"financial emergency\" as rationale. His idea was not formally presented to the board.) If Rufo represented a modern, media-savvy social conservatism, then Speir embodied a more atavistic traditionalism, both more wandering and more truculent. But that is part of DeSantis's coalition, too.\n\nDeSantis came to Sarasota a week later. He delivered a speech outlining some legislative proposals regarding public higher education in Florida: he would ban diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) programs and the teaching of critical race theory, give trustees broader powers to review and fire faculty, and compel colleges to deprioritize fields deemed to fit a \"political agenda.\" At New College, the action was more direct, and swift. With each of DeSantis's appointees voting in favor, the Board of Trustees fired the college's president, Patricia Okker, a scholar of nineteenth-century literature, and replaced her with Richard Corcoran, a former Republican speaker of the Florida State House and DeSantis's first Commissioner of Education. \"It was very illustrative of their intentions, because with Dr. Okker you had someone who was a career educator,\" Alex Obraud, a junior majoring in anthropology and a leader of recent student protests against DeSantis's appointees, told me. \"I didn't agree with her about everything, but she was in it for the right reasons, and she was smart and effective. Getting rid of her summarily to pay more than twice as much money to a career politician who is coming in with an agenda-that's not someone who's in it for the students.\"\n\nIn the public forums I attended, the students seemed more likely to perceive the takeover as an effort to make the campus less welcoming to gender difference, while the faculty were more inclined to see it as a misunderstanding of what made the college educationally distinct. Donal O'Shea, a math professor who served as New College's president before Okker, told me, \"If you think about the state-university system as an educational portfolio, then New College is an alternative investment that occasionally paid enormous dividends.\" One year, O'Shea went on, New College had supplied four of the state university system's six Fulbright scholars; another year, the school's student scientists had won forty per cent of the Goldwater scholarships awarded in Florida.\n\nUniversities, like cities, often look politically uniform from a distance but have a dense and highly contested internal politics. The argument that New College was a political monolith is complicated by the most famous story told about the campus before the DeSantis takeover: the conversion of R. Derek Black, who had grown up in a prominent white-nationalist family, in West Palm Beach, before coming to New College in 2010. While on a study-abroad program, Black was exposed in campus-wide chat forums as the host of a white-nationalist Internet radio show. Demonstrations ensued. Black had chosen the school because it had an excellent medieval-studies department and because it was affordable. Family lore also held that one thing that the Blacks did at college was learn to argue with leftists. But after he had been exposed, Black found himself being drawn away from white nationalism by his classmates. There were small gestures-people making conversation in the lunch line-and large ones: a Jewish student invited him to attend weekly Shabbat dinners. By graduation, he had split with the white-nationalist movement and his family and now considers himself something of a progressive; he also married one of the women who had engaged with him after his return to campus.\n\nBlack is now a doctoral candidate in medieval history at the University of Chicago. When I spoke to him last week, I asked whether he thought his conversion would have happened at another college. \"I really don't think so,\" he said. The key, Black went on, was New College's small scale. In the school forum, \"there were all these threads that said 'Don't speak to him, don't acknowledge him, we want to make him feel like a pariah,\" Black said. \"But the underlying thing is that is so difficult to enforce.\" Black has been involved in the campaign against the trustees. \"I think the school is a good enough institution that the state should want to support it,\" he said. His hope is that \"DeSantis loses interest or it proves too difficult or they can't figure out what victory looks like.\"\n\nI had been wondering about what victory might look like to the new trustees myself. Another new DeSantis-appointed trustee, Matthew Spalding, a former official at the Heritage Foundation and now a vice-president at Hillsdale College, took pains to explain that Hillsdale is \"a private, Christian college\" that accepts no government funds, while New College is public and funded by taxpayers. \"That will not change,\" Spalding wrote to me. \"The legislatively defined 'distinctive mission' of New College is to be 'the residential liberal arts college of Florida.' This is important.\"\n\nAnother board member I spoke with, Mark Bauerlein, a retired English professor at Emory, took a similar line. Bauerlein, a \"vigorous, ruthless, and relentless\" opponent of D.E.I. programs, has some quirky points of view-he wanted more organized sports and was bothered by a campus that was  sixty-five per cent female. \"Any society with that kind of gender imbalance is inherently unstable,\" he said. But he also sounded like he mostly wanted a \"great books\" liberal-arts education; he told me that he would like to bring the academic Stanley Fish to campus. \"The work demand, the intensity of the liberal-arts education-that's pretty good,\" Bauerlein said. \"I do not doubt the commitment of the faculty.\"\n\nFor the people at New College, this has been an often confusing situation to read. The sort of reforms that Bauerlein and Spalding were suggesting did not really seem so scary, but they also did not seem like they matched the more aggressive rhetoric coming from the Governor and Rufo. This is a characteristic of DeSantisism. Andrew Spar, the President of the Florida Education Association, which has battled DeSantis over separate laws regulating how race could be taught in Florida classrooms, how gender could be taught in Florida classrooms, and what materials should be allowed in school libraries, pointed out to me that, in each case, the law had created enormous confusion about what exactly schools were supposed to do, and led to different districts and teachers following the rules in different ways. \"All three of those laws are really vague,\" Spar said. \"And because the laws themselves are so vague, and there's so much confusion, the impacts of these policies are really damning, because people don't know what to do.\"\n\nNew College is dealing with a similar vagueness. With his new trustees, DeSantis has assembled some leading intellectuals who represent different strains within social conservatism, but among them there are internal contradictions. Did the new trustees want a traditional liberal-arts education, or a university that sends graduates to higher-paying jobs? Did they want to defend the rights of the faculty to say whatever they pleased, or ask the Florida state legislature to fire all of them? A Christian college or a secular one? Should it try to grow dramatically, or stay about the same size? If a woke culture was supposed to be the problem, how were they defining \"wokeness,\" anyway?\n\nAt times, DeSantis's vagueness has been seen as a cover for a hidden agenda-for instance, to drain resources from public schools for private ones, or to keep Floridians from publicly acknowledging the existence of gay people. My own view is that his politics are less programmatic than that. DeSantis has pursued some of these campaigns extensively, and quietly dropped others not long after they made a splash. The process underway in Florida and at New College is less about ideology than about power. DeSantis's culture war has teeth because he is the governor of a large and growing state with unified political control and-unlike Trump-he understands and can make use of his bureaucratic powers. What makes DeSantis both distinct and formidable is that his campaigns are about not ends but means. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Ron DeSantis Slump\n\nGo to YouTube, and you can still find the Ron DeSantis who got Republican donors and media so excited, just a year ago. A source familiar with the campaign described clips of DeSantis, usually at press conferences he gave as governor of Florida, that went viral in Republican circles. \"A reporter comes in and asks a question, and he just rips their heart out,\" the source said. The questions were often about DeSantis's COVID policies, and also sometimes about his aggressive stances against the teaching of race and gender topics in public schools or his perplexing war on Disney. In response, DeSantis generally took an impatient tone-the press, he seemed to suggest, was once again wasting everyone's time. The source went on, \"But those were situations where it was about Florida policies, which he knew like the back of his hand, where he could deploy his computer brain. And it was in front of a crowd that was going to applaud no matter what.\" In every sense, the staffer said, \"he was in total control of the situation.\"\n\nDeSantis was offering something in thin supply during the pandemic years : the impression of conservative mastery. Just forty-four years old, a former Little League World Series standout who had gone to Yale on the strength of his ninety-ninth-percentile S.A.T.s, DeSantis had taken a contrarian, laissez-faire position on COVID . He didn't endure the disastrous public-health outcomes that liberals had warned of. His political popularity boomed, and so did migration to Florida. It wasn't surprising that this kind of figure would appeal most keenly to conservative élites: his gubernatorial campaign last year, effectively a COVID victory lap, drew an astonishing two hundred million dollars in contributions from donors, and, in a four-month period just after the 2020 election, Fox News producers asked DeSantis to appear on the network more than a hundred and ten times. By the end of 2022, after DeSantis romped to reëlection in a midterm cycle in which Republicans underperformed and some of Trump's preferred candidates flamed out, it seemed to G.O.P. pollsters that the DeSantis phenomenon was no longer just top-down. \"Every stitch of data I had said they really liked him,\" a pollster for an opposing Republican campaign told me.\n\nSince the 2020 election, Sarah Longwell, a Republican pollster closely affiliated with the Never Trump movement, has been conducting frequent focus groups with Republicans who voted twice for Trump. This past winter, Longwell told me, \"We started having to screen groups for Trump favorability to find people who even wanted Trump to run again. I can't tell you how dominant DeSantis was in that moment, and how clear people were that it was time to move on.\" Former Trump voters, Longwell said, \"were very DeSantis curious. They just thought Trump had too much baggage. But the way they talked about DeSantis, which I found interesting, was that they would talk about him relative to Trump. They would say, 'He's Trump without the baggage,' or 'He's Trump with a new fight,' or 'He's Trump not on steroids.' That was one of my favorites.\"\n\nOne theory circulating among politicos right now is that DeSantis simply waited too long to enter the race. He did not announce his candidacy formally until May, and did so in a clumsy and widely mocked Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk. But, whatever the reasons for the delay, it was also the case that DeSantis and his advisers had not solved a fundamental problem for the campaign: how to run against Trump. Within two months of DeSantis's announcement, his campaign laid off a third of its staff; last week, he fired his campaign manager. In a recent Times /Siena poll, he trailed Trump 54-17 among national Republican primary voters. \"Trump Crushing DeSantis and G.O.P. Rivals,\" the headline ran .\n\nEven before its official launch, the campaign and its allies were conducting polls and focus groups to test various anti-Trump messages. Across several months, the source familiar with the campaign said that it consistently struggled to find a message critical of Trump that resonated with rank-and-file Republican voters. Even attaching Trump's name to an otherwise effective message had a tendency to invert the results, this source said. If a moderator said that the COVID lockdowns destroyed small businesses and facilitated the largest upward wealth transfer in modern American history, seventy per cent of the Republicans surveyed would agree. But, if the moderator said that Trump's COVID lockdowns destroyed small businesses and facilitated the largest upward wealth transfer in modern American history, the source said, seventy per cent would disagree.\n\nAt the outset of his campaign, DeSantis had a strong base of support among more moderate, college-educated voters. But this base alone is not big enough to win the Republican primaries. \"Early on in the race, DeSantis was gonna have to make a decision,\" a leading G.O.P. consultant working with a rival candidate told me. One path, he said, would have been to run as a moderate, pull all the anti-Trump people into his camp, and then go to work on the conservatives by arguing that he was younger than Trump, more competent at governing, and likelier to win. The other path was to try to run from the right, even if that cost him the support of his natural base, on the theory that it would be impossible to beat Trump without denting his conservative support and that eventually the moderates would come home because, as the consultant put it, \"Where the fuck else are they gonna go?\" The DeSantis campaign, he posited, \"started with that second strategy. And then the polling tanked and they got scared.\"\n\nIn truth, a conservative run was a more natural fit for DeSantis. As DeSantis built his national brand, he had leaned heavily into a hard form of culture war: attacking Disney and pushing laws that curtailed the teaching of gender- and race-related topics. It would have been tricky for even the most adept politician to pivot from this to a moderate pitch of good governance and policy. The DeSantis campaign also seemed to lack Trump's appeal to what the source familiar with the campaign called the \"deep base instincts\" of the Republican Party. Perhaps to compensate for this and to channel the right-wing id, the campaign associated itself with some envelope-pushing young activists and journalists. This backfired. One of them, Pedro Gonzalez, was revealed in June to have sent countless antisemitic messages through Telegram Messenger. (An example: \"Not every Jew is problematic, but the sad fact is that most are.\") In July, a young DeSantis speechwriter, Nate Hochman, was fired after circulating a pro-DeSantis video that included a symbol, the Sonnenrad, that is common in Nazi imagery. The rival consultant told me, \"I think that was a pretty good peek under the lid about what they're obsessed with in Tallahassee. And it ain't improving homeownership rates.\"\n\nBut, from the start of this year, DeSantis has struggled to identify issues that might appeal to very conservative voters. In February, DeSantis criticized the U.S.'s support of the Ukraine war, but he was forced to reverse his position after some prominent donors threw a fit. In April, as much of the political world was coming to terms with Democrats' electoral advantage after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade, DeSantis signed a bill outlawing abortion after six weeks. Even on his signature \"anti-woke\" platform, he sometimes seemed to be searching for an original message. In April, NBC News reported that DeSantis was carrying around \" Woke, Inc. ,\" the book written by his Republican Presidential primary rival Vivek Ramaswamy , an outsider and former longshot who last week edged ahead of DeSantis in one national poll. DeSantis can sound quite similar to Ramaswamy on the campaign trail: both candidates have called for bans on TikTok and for a \"declaration of economic independence\" from China, and to \"shut down the F.B.I.\" (Ramaswamy) or to fire its director (DeSantis). In February, Ramaswamy had called for the deployment of the U.S. military against Mexican drug cartels (\"we gotta go Soleimani on them\"), and this month DeSantis said he would use military force and drone strikes against the cartels. Without the same dominant position in conservative media he'd had this winter, DeSantis's ideas could sound a little generic.\n\nFor several years now, it's been common to hear Republican consultants and pollsters say that Trump dominates among the Party's conservative base because he is seen as a \"fighter.\" More than anyone else in the G.O.P. primary, DeSantis has a reputation for political aggression and a track record of conservative efficacy, but that doesn't seem to have helped him. Perhaps this characterization of Trump is misleading. Is he really a fighter ? He is a yeller, certainly, an expresser, a maker of big threats. He also wanders away from the fights he has started. To think that what Republican voters really want in a Presidential candidate is someone they can trust to complete the border wall may be a misunderstanding of the Party's base. Trump has managed to always make politics gargantuan: it wasn't about immigration but a civilizational struggle; it wasn't about an election but democracy itself. \"You have millions of Americans who are literally willing to die for Trump right now,\" the source familiar with the DeSantis campaign told me, \"and being, like, 'He didn't fire Fauci' is not going to change their minds.\"\n\nOn August 4th, a verdict of a sort was delivered on DeSantis's effort to pry the conservative base from Trump. The hotel magnate Robert Bigelow, the largest individual donor to the DeSantis super PAC , Never Back Down, to which he'd given twenty million dollars, told Reuters that he would not give any more money to the campaign unless it adopts a more moderate approach, saying that DeSantis \"does need to shift to get moderates.\" When I spoke with Sarah Longwell a few days later, she told me that, in her last two focus groups of two-time Trump voters, not a single participant had said that they wanted DeSantis to win the nomination; some had said that they preferred Tim Scott or Ramaswamy. When a moderator mentioned DeSantis, Longwell tweeted, one participant had said, dismissively, that he \"might be Deep State.\"\n\nDeSantis is running haggard on the trail. In recent weeks, he's often spent his Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in Iowa, on whose caucuses his fortunes increasingly seem to rest. He wears cowboy boots with slightly raised heels, and his wife, Casey, wears cowboy boots, too. The towns are small, the venues impeccably styled, the crowds medium-sized, late-middle-aged, and respectful. \"We're banging out those counties,\" DeSantis said to a small clutch of reporters in National, with a forced joviality. Whether you compare this scene with Trump's rolling, snarling jam-band tour, now in its sixth year, or with DeSantis's original ambitions to stage a national campaign, leaning heavily on the airwaves, the Florida governor's campaign right now looks small. (At the Iowa State Fair this past weekend, the Trump team hired a private plane to \"strategically\" fly overhead while DeSantis was flipping burgers, according to Semafor .) The qualities that recommended DeSantis six months ago are intact; Trump is in a strong poll position but a perilous legal one . When I followed DeSantis on the Iowa trail last week, at least, the challenge seemed to be the fundamental political matter of what, exactly, he was trying to say.\n\nIn a brewery on the outskirts of Decorah, DeSantis didn't tell many stories, about others or himself, or give a capsule version of his biography; perhaps he assumed his audience already knew it. Instead, he sounded much like he does in the format in which he is most adept, the rapid-fire TV interview, ticking through a series of talking points that are familiar to those who follow conservative media closely but can be opaque to others; a line denouncing the excesses of E.S.G. was met with silence. He did not mention his conflict with Disney; the riff on \"parental rights in education\" was reserved for his wife, who took the mike after him. Was he abandoning the culture-war hard line? It was difficult to tell. I had the impression that he was hedging. During the Q. & A. session, he was asked what he thought about the latest indictment of Trump , this time for his role in the January 6th insurrection . DeSantis replied, \"It's politically motivated-absolutely. . . . They've been trying to get him since he became President.\" He was more or less making his opponent's points for him.\n\nIf the DeSantis campaign is changing, it isn't yet obvious how. The source familiar with the campaign told me, \"If you're seeking to understand why this entire operation has been such a disaster, the problem has more to do with the fact that there isn't any unifying theory of the case and certainly no unifying, coherent message-it's a schizophrenic campaign with a schizophrenic message.\" DeSantis, the source went on, had put himself in the impossible position of trying to be \"more moderate than Trump and more conservative than him simultaneously.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the campaign had taken note of an anti-Trump message that seemed likely to have some traction with Republican voters: a sixty-second spot, \"John,\" cut by a PAC . In it, a middle-aged man, seated on the steps of a suburban home and speaking calmly to the camera, says that he loves Donald Trump and saw him as a \"breath of fresh air,\" but that this got him disinvited from his sister's for Thanksgiving. \"The drama . . . he's got so many distractions, the constant fighting, there's something every day,\" John says. \"And I'm not sure he can focus on moving the country forward.\" The country is heading in the wrong direction, he adds, \"and we definitely need somebody that can freakin' win. I think you probably lose that bet if you voted for Trump.\"\n\nBut if this was the sort of message that DeSantis's supporters hoped might dent Trump's standing, there was an obvious problem: it did not so much as mention DeSantis. The first debate is on August 23rd, and the best message that the DeSantis campaign has found is not about the Florida governor himself. Like so much else about his candidacy, it exists in wary relation to Trump. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Minor Reboot Won't Save Ron DeSantis's Toxic Campaign\n\nOut of Tallahassee, Florida, comes unsurprising news. After being barraged by negative media stories, watching its man's poll ratings plummet downward like a kid on a zip line, and running into an early cash crunch, Ron DeSantis 's Presidential campaign is planning a \"reboot,\" NBC News reported last week. On Sunday, the Times followed up NBC's scoop with a dishy story about overspending and infighting inside the campaign, which is a sprawling operation-although a bit less sprawling than it was a couple of weeks ago, before a looming money shortage prompted it to lay off roughly ten people.\n\nNews of the reboot emerged as the Florida governor found himself at the center of yet more damaging stories. Last week, Florida's Board of Education approved new guidelines for the state's public-school course in African American history, which said, in part: \"Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" When reporters asked DeSantis about the new guidelines on Friday, he said that he hadn't had anything to do with writing them but continued to defend them, remarking that they would probably show some of the enslaved \"eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life.\"\n\nOver the weekend, the Times published another article about DeSantis, this one focussing on his record during the coronavirus pandemic , when he initially pushed for Floridians aged sixty-five and older to be vaccinated but subsequently highlighted his opposition to vaccine mandates when the shot became available to younger residents. In the summer of 2021, the Delta variant hit the state hard, and about twenty-three thousand Floridians died, nine thousand of whom were under sixty-five. \"These were preventable deaths,\" Dr. Scott Rivkees, who was Florida's surgeon general until September, 2021, told the Times . \"It breaks my heart thinking that things could have turned out differently if people embraced vaccines instead of this anti-vax stuff.\"\n\nHow bad are things for DeSantis? According to Real Clear Politics' average of recent G.O.P. primary polls, he is still in second place, with the support of 19.3 per cent of respondents, but he's trailing Donald Trump by more than thirty points. The latest individual survey, from Harvard CAPS -Harris, put the Trump-DeSantis margin at forty points-Trump is polling at fifty-two per cent, and DeSantis at twelve per cent. That poll also showed Vivek Ramaswamy , the biotech entrepreneur, who is attracting a good deal of media attention, running just two points behind DeSantis. The survey may have been an outlier, but for DeSantis the bad news keeps coming. According to the Financial Times , two of his richest potential backers, the billionaires Ken Griffin and Nelson Peltz, are now rethinking their plans to support him because of his far-right positions, including his clampdown on teaching about gender issues and his signing of a law banning abortions after six weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, officials from DeSantis's campaign met with some of his remaining donors at a luxury ski lodge in Deer Valley, Utah, and told them that, going forward, the governor's team would adopt a leaner, \"insurgent,\" posture, Politico reported. The NBC News story said that the new campaign strategy will involve \"more handshaking in diners and churches,\" more of a national focus with fewer references to his home state, and an effort to further engage the mainstream media. In the world of political consultants, campaign operatives, and political reporters, it is often taken as a given that operational details of this nature can determine a campaign's outcome. Recent history doesn't provide much support for that theory, though. In 2016, Trump's local organization was spotty, many of his campaign stops took place in sports stadiums and aircraft hangars, and he was too cheap to blanket the airwaves. He won the Republican nomination easily. Four years later, Joe Biden got the Democratic nomination despite running a lacklustre primary campaign that saw him finish fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. After he turned things around in South Carolina, with a big assist from Representative Jim Clyburn , other moderate Democratic candidates decided that he represented the best shot of beating Trump, and they dropped out before Super Tuesday.\n\nThis record suggests that Presidential races-primaries and general elections-are usually decided by major political forces that transcend the details of the campaign. In 2016, Trump successfully tapped into nativism, nationalism, economic disenchantment, and alienation from organized politics-all phenomena which were (and are) deeply rooted in American society. In 2020, Biden tapped into an even more powerful force at the time: revulsion at Trump's Presidency. The question facing DeSantis isn't whether he gives interviews to Newsmax or CNN. It's what big political force does he have at his back that could sweep him to victory?\n\nAt the start of this year, the answer appeared to be electability. Following DeSantis's runaway reëlection in Florida, the argument was that he could appeal to a broad spectrum of Republicans who believed it was time to move on from Trump. Today, that voting demographic looks a good deal narrower. Since April, when the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg , indicted Trump on charges related to paying off the adult-film performer Stormy Daniels , many Republican voters have rallied around him. Meanwhile, DeSantis has undermined the electability argument by running to the right of Trump on cultural issues, evidently in the belief that \"anti-wokeism\" is the big force that will propel him to the nomination. It's too early to say for sure that this culture-war strategy is doomed-he's still in second place, and the Iowa caucus is nearly six months away-but one thing is certain: it has propelled him into the political netherworld of encouraging anti-vaxxers and inciting bigotry.\n\nDeSantis's suggestion that slavery had some positive aspects is only the latest example. Late last month, his campaign shared a video that criticized Trump for past statements expressing support for the L.G.B.T.Q. community and highlighted DeSantis's signing of extreme anti-trans laws in Florida. Even after Log Cabin Republicans, an organization representing L.G.B.T. conservatives, criticized the video as homophobic, DeSantis defended its contents. He said that it was \"totally fair game\" to target Trump because, before becoming President, he allowed trans-women to compete in his Miss Universe beauty pageant.\n\nSetting aside, for a moment, the sheer obnoxiousness of DeSantis's tactics, strategic questions arise. Did anyone in his circle raise the question of how many Republican primary voters would be susceptible to the argument that Trump was a spreader of \"gender ideology,\" as DeSantis claimed in his defense of the video? More broadly, how strong is the evidence that \"anti-wokeism\" is as potent a force as DeSantis-a self-described \"data guy\"-believes it to be? Without a doubt, attacking Anthony Fauci and supporting the removal of some books from Florida school libraries fires up some right-wing activists, social-media influencers, and talk-show hosts. But there's also evidence that most Republican voters are primarily concerned with many of the same things that other Americans care about: the economy, health care, immigration, guns, and crime. In the latest Harvard CAPS -Harris poll, just six per cent of all respondents, and just eight per cent of Republicans, said that \"Political correctness/cancel culture\" is one of the most important issues facing the country. (Thirty-nine per cent of Republicans identified \"Price increases/inflation\" as a top issue, and twenty-nine per cent picked \"Economy and Jobs.\")\n\nIt's sometimes overlooked that, in 2016, Trump twinned his race-baiting and attacks on cultural élites with criticisms of C.E.O.s, corporations, and bankers who had shipped abroad American jobs, and of the politicians who had enabled them. Although debates continue about the relative importance of economic and cultural factors in Trump's victory, his championing of economic nationalism and protectionism surely played a role in persuading large numbers of working-class Americans to vote for him. Democrats have been forced to respond. The Biden Administration has retained some of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and has adopted an aggressive industrial policy aimed at rebuilding U.S. manufacturing.\n\nIn running as the ultimate culture warrior, meanwhile, DeSantis has largely absented himself from broader debates about the country's future. Back in March, when he delivered his annual State of the State address, he did talk about Florida's economic record, boasting, \"We rank No. 1 in the nation for new business formations. We are No. 1 in economic growth among large states.\" Surprisingly, these themes haven't figured prominently in his campaign to date. And, going forward, according to the NBC News story, he's going to be making even fewer references to Florida.\n\nReboot or no reboot, DeSantis appears to be all in on the culture war. So far, this hasn't worked for him, and appearing at more Iowa diners seems unlikely to change things. Like the rest of the Republican candidates not named Trump, he's left hoping for a divine or judicial intervention. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Can Ron DeSantis Displace Donald Trump as the G.O.P.'s Combatant-in-Chief?\n\nOne Sunday afternoon in September, 2020, Jay Bhattacharya, an epidemiologist at Stanford University, was at home in Los Altos when he got an unexpected call. It was Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and he wanted to talk about the coronavirus. In the early months of the pandemic, Bhattacharya had established himself as an outlier among public-health experts. He is one of three scientists who drafted the Great Barrington Declaration, which argued that many governments were doing more harm than good by shutting down economies and schools. The only practical approach, they said, would be to protect the most vulnerable-mainly by isolating the elderly-and allow everyone else to go about their lives until vaccines and herd immunity neutralized the disease. With COVID -19 killing hundreds of Americans every day, the signers of the declaration became pariahs in their profession. \"I've lost friends,\" Bhattacharya told me. \"I'm lucky to have tenure.\"\n\nDeSantis, young and aggressively confident, was similarly convinced that he could find a better way to handle the virus. Talking with him, Bhattacharya was surprised by his command of the research. \"He'd read all the medical literature-all of it, not just the abstracts,\" he told me. The science, though, remained unclear-Did the virus linger on surfaces? Did it travel in droplets or in a fog?-and many politicians found that the most appealing solutions were the ones that fit their ideology. For DeSantis, who espouses a libertarian vision of small government and personal freedom, the ideas in the Great Barrington Declaration resonated. In his view, the government, apart from protecting the elderly and making treatments available, should do almost nothing.\n\nDexter Filkins discusses the Florida governor on The New Yorker Radio Hour.\n\nInitially, as the virus began spreading in Florida, DeSantis had ordered a statewide lockdown, in accordance with Dr. Anthony Fauci's recommendations. Three weeks later, he changed his mind. \"We will never do any of these lockdowns again,\" he said. After talking to Bhattacharya, he lifted nearly all remaining restrictions-on schools, government buildings, stores, restaurants, and other private businesses-and halted the enforcement of mask mandates.\n\nAs the death toll mounted, he was mocked by critics as \"DeathSantis\" and denounced by the mainstream press. \"Any public distrust of this administration has been well-earned,\" the Miami Herald editorial board wrote. \"We can't trust the governor with our lives.\" A former political adviser with knowledge of the COVID response told me that DeSantis was unfazed: \"We were getting crucified, but to him it was just noise.\" DeSantis revels in defying what he sees as a corrupt and self-satisfied liberal establishment. Those who work closely with him say that he is unique among elected officials in his disregard for public opinion and the press. \"Ron's strength as a politician is that he doesn't give a fuck,\" a Republican consultant who knows him told me. \"Ron's weakness as a politician is that he doesn't give a fuck. Big donors? He doesn't give a shit. Cancels on them all the time.\"\n\nDeSantis's approach to the pandemic gave rise to an entire governing strategy, in which he regularly denounced some outrage, invariably perpetrated by the left, and proclaimed that he was the only one brave enough to stop it. He laced his speeches and press conferences with anger; when he walked, he thrust out his chest like a soldier on parade. He became a regular on Fox News, second only to Donald Trump as a figure of admiration. His aggressive defense of minimal state action, and his denunciations of anyone who disagreed with him, made him a conservative folk hero.\n\nDeSantis faces reëlection later this year, but his ascent has been so dramatic that in a few polls he comes out ahead of Trump in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination; without Trump, he commands a big lead. Both men claim to channel the rage of an electorate that feels sneered at and dismissed by liberal institutions. But while Trump, with his lazy, Barnumesque persona, projects a fundamental lack of seriousness, DeSantis has an intense work ethic, a formidable intelligence, and a granular understanding of policy. Articulate and fast on his feet, he has been described as Trump with a brain.\n\nIn February, DeSantis appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel, a sprawling resort near Orlando. The convention halls were filled with the Party's new vanguard, which was, on the whole, poorer and angrier than the bankers and golfers who led the G.O.P. a generation ago. The panels ranged from outraged to vengeful. A health-care panel was called \"Obamacare Still Kills.\" A discussion of COVID -19 policy was titled \"Lock Downs and Mandates: Now Do You Understand Why We Have a Second Amendment.\"\n\nFrom the main stage, DeSantis flashed a smile and tossed baseball caps into the crowd. In a twenty-minute speech, he described an America under assault by left-wing élites, who \"want to delegitimize our founding institutions.\" His job as governor, he said, was to fight the horsemen of the left: critical race theory, \"Faucian dystopia,\" uncontrolled immigration, Big Tech, \"left-wing oligarchs,\" \"Soros-funded prosecutors,\" transgender athletes, and the \"corporate media.\" In Florida, he said, he had created a \"citadel of freedom\" that had become a beacon for people \"chafing under authoritarian rule\"; he cited disgruntled citizens of Australia, Canada, and Europe. (He didn't mention the Russian invasion of Ukraine.) \"We're not letting Florida cities burn down,\" DeSantis told the crowd. \"In Florida, you're not going to get a slap on the wrist. You are getting the inside of a jail cell.\" He offered no new policies, though he did mention that he was requiring high-school seniors to pass a civics exam.\n\nDeSantis is not a charismatic speaker, but he is dogged and precise, and the crowd was inflamed. Trump, the ostensible star of CPAC , was scheduled to speak later, but DeSantis didn't mention him. (\"Their relationship is complicated,\" a lawyer close to DeSantis told me.) And, while DeSantis used Florida as a touchstone, he sounded as if he had all of America on his mind. \"In times like these, there is no substitute for courage,\" he said. \"We need people all over the country to be willing to put on that full armor of God.\" As the crowd burst into cheers, he vowed, \"We have only begun to fight.\"\n\nFrom a remove-onstage at a conference, or pressing an argument on Fox News-DeSantis seems constructed for political success. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood, went to Yale and played on the baseball team, graduated from Harvard Law School, served in the military in Iraq. His family is ready made for a campaign brochure. \"He's good-looking,\" John Morgan, a lawyer in Orlando who has worked with DeSantis, told me. \"His wife is really good-looking. His family is beautiful. They look like they're from central casting.\"\n\nIn person, he often comes across differently. \"Ron is at his best on paper,\" a Florida political leader who knows DeSantis told me. \"Then you meet him and you say, 'Oh, my gosh.' \" People who work closely with him describe a man so aloof that he sometimes finds it difficult to carry on a conversation. \"He's not comfortable engaging other people,\" a political leader who sees him often told me. \"He walks into the meeting and doesn't acknowledge the rest of us. There's no eye contact and little or no interaction. The moment I start to ask him a question, his head twitches. You can tell he doesn't want to be there.\" (DeSantis's office declined requests for comment.)\n\nLink copied\n\nNearly everyone I talked to who knew DeSantis commented on his affect: his lack of curiosity about others, his indifferent table manners, his aversion to the political rituals of dispensing handshakes and questions about the kids. One former associate told me that his demeanor stems from a conviction that others have advantages that were denied to him. \"The anger comes more easily to him because he has a chip on his shoulder,\" she said. \"He is a serious guy. Driven.\"\n\nIn February, I drove to Dunedin, Florida, a city of thirty-six thousand near Tampa, where DeSantis spent most of his youth. His old neighborhood is typical of those built before the boom years began, in the nineteen-seventies; the houses are modest and close together, and the city, once dotted with open lots, is overrun by traffic. DeSantis's street is quiet, though; many of the houses have screen doors and jalousie windows and sprinklers attached to garden hoses. American flags and Trump signs mark the lawns, including the one at the house where DeSantis's parents still live.\n\nWhen I knocked, the Governor's father, also named Ron, came to the door. He was dressed in a Florida State University T-shirt and shorts, and there was a day's stubble on his face. \"I'd rather not talk to you,\" he said. \"You might be a good guy, but, if I tell you something, somebody-maybe not you-will twist it around.\" Then he stepped outside and started to talk. The F.S.U. T-shirt, he said, came from his daughter, Christina, who earned bachelor's and master's degrees there. \"When my daughter graduated from F.S.U., I thought it was the last time I'd ever have to make the drive to Tallahassee-two hundred and thirty-one miles,\" he said. In fact, his wife, Karen, who is a retired nurse, was in Tallahassee that day to visit their son at the governor's mansion; Ron, Sr., had stayed home alone.\n\nDeSantis told me that he'd brought his family to Dunedin from Jacksonville, where Ron was born, in 1978. He had a job with Nielsen, the television-ratings company. For years, he traversed neighborhoods, asking people if they would agree to have a Nielsen box attached to their television. \"It's incredible how many people would just let me into their houses, even though they didn't know me,\" he said. \"I'd be there until eight o'clock installing the thing.\"\n\nI asked what Ron was like growing up. \"He was stubborn,\" DeSantis said. \"If he set his mind to something, you couldn't shake him.\" DeSantis pointed into the street, where he and his son used to play catch; there were ball fields nearby, where he had coached Ron's Little League teams. \"I tried not to favor him, and Ron didn't like that,\" he said. Early on, his son had read \"The Science of Hitting,\" by Ted Williams, the baseball great, who advised young hitters to take care in choosing pitches to swing at. \"I must have thrown a half million pitches to Ron, and I think he swung at about five hundred of them,\" he said. \"I wish he would have never read it.\" In 1991, when DeSantis was twelve, his team made it to the Little League World Series.\n\nThe young DeSantis attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School and then Dunedin High, where he was a star outfielder. He was focussed and motivated, his father said, adding, \"He didn't get that from me.\" DeSantis scored in the ninety-ninth percentile on his SAT and was accepted to Yale, his father said: \"It's still the thing I'm most proud of.\" But he didn't like to make too much of it. \"Everybody wants to brag about their kids, and people ask me about Ron. I try to be modest.\"\n\nAt Yale, DeSantis majored in history and played on the baseball team, in the outfield. In the Yale tradition, the team never had a winning season while DeSantis was there. (\"Pretty sure we were the worst team in Division One,\" one of his teammates told me.) In his senior year, he was among the best hitters, batting .336, and was elected captain. His former teammates' recollections are sharply divided, but nearly everyone I spoke with remembered him as singularly focussed, with little time for parties or goofing off; he worked several jobs to help pay his tuition. \"Ron was a bit of a loner, not a social butterfly,\" Dave Fortenbaugh, a former teammate, told me. \"He spent a lot of hours in the library.\"\n\nSome recalled that DeSantis was so intensely focussed that he wasn't much of a teammate. \"Ron is the most selfish person I have ever interacted with,\" another teammate told me. \"He has always loved embarrassing and humiliating people. I'm speaking for others-he was the biggest dick we knew.\" But the same teammate praised DeSantis's intellect. \"This is the frustrating part. He's so fucking smart and so creative,\" he said. \"You couldn't even plagiarize off his work. He'd take some angle, and everyone knew there was only one person who could have done that.\"\n\nAfter graduating, with honors, DeSantis taught history for a year at the Darlington School, a private institution in Rome, Georgia, before enrolling at Harvard Law School; a friend told me that he'd been inspired by the movie \"A Few Good Men.\" In the film, Tom Cruise plays a judge advocate general-a Navy attorney-who defends marines accused of a deadly assault at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. With the war in Iraq still raging, DeSantis, too, became a judge advocate general. He was posted to Naval Station Mayport, near Jacksonville, and also to Guantánamo, where he dealt with detainees. A colleague who served with DeSantis remembered, \"Ron was a voracious worker, and he worked at phenomenal speed. He was a superb writer, especially for his age.\" Even then, his ambition seemed consuming. \"Ron's a user,\" the former colleague told me. \"If you had utility to him, he would be nice to you. If you didn't, he wouldn't give you the time of day.\"\n\nIn 2007, DeSantis deployed to Iraq as a lawyer for SEAL Team One, which was conducting operations in Ramadi. The SEAL s have a reputation for being secretive and insular, but DeSantis enjoyed their company, his father told me: \"He worked out with them.\" DeSantis briefed the SEAL s on rules of engagement-when they could shoot, how they should treat prisoners. \"Of course we were worried about him,\" his father said. \"Ron told us he was just in one place, in Ramadi, but afterwards we found out that he'd been moving all around the area, from city to city, with the SEAL s. It really upset my wife.\"\n\nBack in Florida, DeSantis started dating Casey Black, a television news reporter for WJXT, in Jacksonville; in 2010, they were married. Not long afterward, a seat opened up in the Sixth Congressional District, south of Jacksonville Beach. In 2012, DeSantis entered the race.\n\nDeSantis campaigned on smaller government and lower taxes, arguing to overturn Obamacare and eliminate entire federal agencies. \"My mission was largely to stop Barack Obama,\" he told a crowd later. As the campaign got under way, DeSantis published a book titled \"Dreams from Our Founding Fathers\"-a swipe at the President's memoir. For a campaign book, it's unusually wide-ranging, with carefully argued sections on the Federalist Papers, the Progressive Era, and the leftist theoretician Saul Alinsky. The basic contention, though, would have been familiar to followers of Barry Goldwater: \"The conceit that underlies many of Obama's policies and his allies is that virtually any issue, from the waistline of children to the temperature of the earth, is ripe for intervention of expert (and progressive) central planners.\" DeSantis's book was largely ignored-he once told a crowd that it was \"read by about a dozen people\"-but his message resonated in the Sixth District, one of the most conservative in the state. He won the election, and was reëlected twice by wide margins.\n\nIn Congress, an institution where seniority matters, DeSantis had little time to make a substantive impact. Theatrically, though, he created an impression. He helped found the Freedom Caucus, an invitation-only club of hard-right conservatives, and he was among the Republicans who took the government to the brink of default by refusing to raise the national-debt ceiling. Many people worried that the move would harm the government's credit rating and the country's economy. Even John Boehner, the House Speaker, opposed it. In response, DeSantis joined a group of Republican congressmen who threatened to remove Boehner from his post. \"There were governing conservatives and shutdown conservatives,\" David Jolly, a congressman from Florida who served with DeSantis, told me. \"Ron was a shutdown conservative.\"\n\nMany of DeSantis's colleagues remember him as remote. A former member of the Florida delegation told me, \"He always had his earbuds in, to keep people away.\" Others, like Jolly, had a more temperate view. \"He's a little reclusive, a bit of an odd duck,\" Jolly said, \"but he's just incredibly disciplined.\"\n\nDeSantis's colleagues say that he was less interested in drafting legislation than in positioning himself for higher office. In his first term, he started courting leading conservative donors, including the Koch family and Sheldon Adelson, and money began to flow. \"It's not easy getting those meetings,\" Jolly told me. \"But Ron did it, and he convinced them that he was one of their friends.\"\n\nIn 2018, two years after Trump carried Florida in the Presidential election, DeSantis declared his run for governor. His opponent in the primary was Adam Putnam, the state commissioner of agriculture. Putnam was the sort of Republican that Trump had swept away in the primaries: a staid, moderate product of the establishment.\n\nDeSantis's record in Congress had put him at the libertarian edge of his party; he earned one-hundred-per-cent ratings from the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity. He was ideologically consistent, even when it cost him. Twice, DeSantis voted to cut price supports for sugar, pitting himself against one of Florida's most powerful interests, which receives tens of millions of dollars in state subsidies a year. The industry funded Putnam's campaign generously, and its allies financed several attack ads against DeSantis.\n\nFor much of the campaign, DeSantis trailed Putnam. But, in 2017, he started appearing regularly on Fox News, railing against the investigation of Russia's role in helping Trump get elected. On Laura Ingraham's show, he said that the special counsel Robert Mueller's efforts had criminalized ordinary political behavior. \"This is actually taking a bias and basically saying you're gonna use the machinery of government to prevent the American people from making a choice,\" he said. (Mueller's team indicted or took guilty pleas from thirty-seven people and revealed more than a hundred contacts between Trump's campaign and agents of the Russian state.)\n\nTrump saw DeSantis on television and found him appealing: a combative conservative and a former athlete. \"The President loves athletes,\" the former DeSantis associate, who is also close to Trump, explained. Soon afterward, Trump endorsed him on Twitter and then appeared with him at a rally in Tampa. DeSantis shot upward in the polls, and beat Putnam in the primary.\n\nDeSantis began mimicking Trump's characteristic gestures in campaign appearances and paying tribute to him in television ads. In one, DeSantis reads to his son, Mason (\" 'Then Mr. Trump said, \"You're fired!\" '-I love that part.\") and plays blocks with his young daughter, Madison, exhorting her to \"build the wall!\" The ad was tongue in cheek, but it succeeded in linking DeSantis with the President. \"It was the dumbest, most effective ad in Florida history,\" Kevin Cate, a media consultant for DeSantis's opponent, said.\n\nDeSantis had an advantage in the general election: his opponent, Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and the first Black candidate for governor, was running as a progressive in a not particularly progressive state. Gillum was also dogged by an F.B.I. investigation into whether he had accepted gifts from lobbyists. Still, DeSantis began the campaign with a disastrous gaffe, saying on television, \"The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. DeSantis insisted that there was no racial motive behind the statement-\"He uses a lot of dorky phrases like that,\" one of his former colleagues told me-and the outrage didn't endure. But his tone deafness created a disadvantage. \"We were handling Gillum with kid gloves,\" the lawyer close to DeSantis told me. \"We can't hit the guy, because we're trying to defend the fact that we're not racist.\" DeSantis won by about thirty thousand votes, less than half a per cent of the ballots cast.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Trump took credit for DeSantis's victory, saying, \"If I didn't endorse him, he wouldn't have won.\" The campaign was managed by Susie Wiles, a veteran political strategist who had helped Trump win the Presidency in 2016. But, after the election, DeSantis abruptly broke off his relationship with Wiles. A longtime Tallahassee lobbyist told me that DeSantis became angry that her lobbying firm-Ballard Partners, one of the most powerful in the state-was taking over the process of appointing officials. \"There was a confrontation in a meeting, and it all fell apart,\" he said. DeSantis told the firm that its clients would not be welcome in his office as long as they retained Wiles. (Brian Ballard, a founding partner, denied this as \"totally false.\") Wiles left, and Trump hired her to run his 2020 campaign in Florida. Trump told me that DeSantis complained about the move, but that he replied, \"If you have a manager who wins the World Series, you keep the manager.\"\n\nIn office, DeSantis took steps that suggested he intended to govern closer to the center. He buoyed environmentalists by forcing out the nine-member board of the South Florida Water Management District, political appointees who were considered hostile to environmental interests. He named a commission to tackle algae blooms, which befouled rivers and lakes in the southern part of the state. And he appointed several Black jurists. At his inauguration, DeSantis asked the Reverend R. B. Holmes, the pastor of a predominantly Black church in Tallahassee, to lead the prayer. \"I was encouraged,\" Holmes told me.\n\nFor decades, the Democratic Party had commanded a majority of Florida's registered voters. But the state was changing, as Trump's election helped energize a shift in political affinities. The Republican Party's rank and file became increasingly radical, and G.O.P. leaders appeared only too happy to follow them. \"There was always an element of the Republican Party that was batshit crazy,\" Mac Stipanovich, the chief of staff to Governor Bob Martinez, a moderate Republican, told me. \"They had lots of different names-they were John Birchers, they were 'movement conservatives,' they were the religious right. And we did what every other Republican candidate did: we exploited them. We got them to the polls. We talked about abortion. We promised-and we did nothing. They could grumble, but their choices were limited.\n\n\"So what happened?\" Stipanovich continued. \"Trump opened Pandora's box and let them out. And all the nasty stuff that was in the underbelly of American politics got a voice. What was thirty-five per cent of the Republican Party is now eighty-five per cent. And it's too late to turn back.\"\n\nIn April, 2020, during the early days of the pandemic, DeSantis travelled to the convention center in Miami Beach to appear with Dan Gelber, the city's mayor, to discuss the state's response. Gelber, a Democrat, is a former minority leader in the Florida House who teamed up to pass legislation with such Republican leaders as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio; he told me that he is still friendly with both. \"I don't agree with Jeb on a lot of things, but I have a deep and abiding respect for him,\" he said.\n\nAppearing with Gelber, DeSantis outlined the steps that his administration had taken. He had ordered a statewide lockdown. He'd ordered nursing homes sealed off and told the elderly to quarantine; at the time, many states, including New York, were still sending virus patients into nursing homes, which ended in thousands of deaths. Florida had established the first of hundreds of testing centers and set up a Web site that detailed the virus's trajectory. Most notably, it had ordered millions of masks for health-care workers; DeSantis said that he was fighting to get more. \"Having a mask on, I think, would be something that could potentially ward off infections for the most vulnerable,\" he said. At numerous public appearances, the Governor wore a mask himself.\n\nDeSantis regarded these efforts as a kind of baseline. \"If some folks want to do things more, then they can do more in certain situations,\" he said. \"We want to work with the local folks.\" Under Gelber's leadership, Miami Beach, a destination for visitors from abroad, had imposed a mask mandate and aggressively ticketed violators. Gelber told me that he urged DeSantis to establish a robust program of contact-tracing. \"The Governor was supportive of everything we were doing,\" he said.\n\nBut DeSantis soon seemed to lose faith in the scientific establishment. Early in the pandemic, Scott Rivkees, the state surgeon general, convened a conference call of many of Florida's leading public-health experts; at the end of the meeting, he announced that it would be the last. Among those boxed out was Glenn Morris, an epidemiologist whom the University of Florida had recruited in 2007 to set up a center that would help guide the state though the next pandemic. \"We spent years preparing for this moment,\" Morris told me.\n\nThe Governor's aides say that he was intent on his own research, poring over scientific data and medical journals. He also began to consult a small circle of experts from out of state, who saw the virus as essentially uncontrollable. In April, 2020, he began lifting the statewide lockdown-in keeping, he said, with guidelines set forth by Trump's White House. The former political adviser with knowledge of the COVID response told me that DeSantis sympathized with the state's working class, who weren't able to work remotely and typically didn't have much in savings. \"The people who were criticizing the Governor for keeping everything open tended to be people who had the luxury of working at home,\" he said.\n\nFlorida quickly posted some of the country's highest totals of virus cases. In Miami-Dade County, according to records provided by a local official, the number of hospitalizations for COVID rose from about six hundred in an average week to more than two thousand. DeSantis carried on; in July, his education commissioner ordered schools to fully reopen. \"Fear does not help us combat the virus,\" DeSantis said. At times, though, he seemed to be discouraging a clear picture of COVID 's progress. Florida's contact-tracing program was anemic; that July, Gelber noted, it reached only eighteen per cent of infected people in Miami-Dade, the state's most populous county. DeSantis's aides began ignoring Gelber's requests for city-by-city mortality data.\n\nWith cases skyrocketing, the Miami-Dade County Commission imposed a rule requiring masks in any public place. Daily cases declined sharply, in some places to lockdown levels. \"The numbers speak for themselves,\" Gelber said. Across the state, at least nineteen counties followed suit.\n\nSimilar mandates were taking effect around the country, but Bhattacharya, the Stanford epidemiologist who advised DeSantis, argued that there was little evidence to support them. COVID -19 is transmitted not by droplets-as many contagious diseases are-but by mist, he pointed out. In an analysis of sixty-seven randomized trials, the Cochrane Library, a medical database, found that masks did not significantly slow the spread of influenza, which is transmitted similarly to COVID -19. \"Masks are good at stopping droplets, but not aerosols,\" Bhattacharya told me.\n\nBhattacharya's views are not widely shared; many scientists I spoke to said that, although real-world data is scarce, research shows that properly worn masks can slow the spread of the coronavirus. The problem, they said, was that what people do in scientific experiments-wear tightly fitting N95 masks-is not what they do in day-to-day life. They wear inferior masks, often incorrectly, and sometimes ignore the mask requirement altogether. \"There isn't really a debate on whether masks work-we know that masks work,\" Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown University, told me. \"It's theory versus practice. If you go into a crowded bar and take your mask off to drink, a mask requirement is not going to work very well.\"\n\nFor DeSantis, the mandates were a futile, unacceptable intrusion on individual liberties. In September, 2020, as he lifted nearly all remaining government-imposed coronavirus restrictions, he issued an executive order prohibiting local governments from enforcing mask mandates. Gelber responded with a letter, arguing that the order invited needless suffering. \"This is a frightening view, especially in a state where the major industry is hospitality and tourism,\" he said. \"It is not merely going to cause additional community spread and sickness but also hamper our efforts to reopen.\"\n\nThat month, Florida recorded nearly a hundred thousand new cases. Patients overwhelmed hospitals, swamping emergency rooms. \"It's a free-for-all here,\" Dr. Bernard Ashby, a cardiologist and internist who works at Lawnwood Hospital, in Fort Pierce, told me at the time. \"We don't have any beds. The nurses are exhausted.\" Ashby said that, early in the pandemic, DeSantis had failed to alleviate the crisis by helping make such treatments as monoclonal antibodies available. \"He is either completely ignorant of the science, or he's doing what I suspect, playing politics.\"\n\nDr. Aileen Marty, a professor of infectious disease at Florida International University who advised the mayors of several cities, believes that DeSantis was making a conscious choice. \"I think the Governor in his heart of hearts is spreading the virus as a way to herd immunity,\" she said. \"He's under the mistaken impression that once you get the disease you're through with it.\" Seeking herd immunity through natural infection, many scientists say, places a huge proportion of the population at risk of serious illness or death-not just the elderly but also cancer patients and others with compromised immune systems, as well as diabetics and the obese. \"It's forty per cent of the population,\" Marty said.\n\nDeSantis came under furious criticism, accused of putting the forthcoming Presidential election ahead of his citizens' health. \"We believe they want schools to open to falsely portray a nation-and the largest swing state-as moving past the virus,\" an editorial in the Sun-Sentinel , a South Florida newspaper, said. DeSantis assured confidants that he was unmoved by the outrage. The lawyer close to DeSantis told me that he said, \"I'm not worried about what the news cycle is saying about me. It's my responsibility to make decisions, and I'll deal with the criticism.\" But his administration became increasingly intent on controlling its message. At a press conference that April, Surgeon General Rivkees said that people should consider social distancing-for \"probably a year, if not longer.\" After Rivkees sat down, DeSantis's communications director approached and escorted him from the room. Rivkees largely vanished from public view. Last September, he left the administration and joined Brown University.\n\nIn appearances, DeSantis adopted a strident tone, dismissing those who questioned him. During a press conference in January, 2021, Rosa Flores, of CNN, raised her hand to ask a question. Vaccines were becoming available, but the distribution was haphazard; reports had spread of elderly people, some of them in wheelchairs and makeshift beds, waiting all night to get inoculated. \"Governor, what has gone wrong with the rollout of the vaccine?\" Flores asked. \"We've seen phone lines jammed, Web sites crashing-\"\n\nDeSantis interrupted: \"There's a lot of demand.\" As Flores tried to complete her thought, DeSantis jabbed a finger and added, \"You just said, 'What has gone wrong?,' so I'm answering the question.\" Talking over her, he went on, \"You're going to ask how many questions? You get three?\" He pointed to other reporters. \"They only got one question. Why do you get three?\"\n\nWhen Flores finally finished her question, it was a reasonable one: Why had people been kept waiting for vaccines? DeSantis gave an answer, which was not unreasonable, either: Many hospitals had adopted a first-come-first-served policy. But by then DeSantis had evidently decided that much of the media was not worth trying to convince. His real constituency was elsewhere.\n\nAround the time of the press conference, Meredith Beatrice, a communications aide to DeSantis, sent an e-mail to Bridget Gleason, a producer for \"Fox and Friends,\" the network's premier morning show. Beatrice was offering an \"exclusive\" story: Florida was about to vaccinate its millionth senior citizen. \"Look forward to working with you and the team bright and early tomorrow!\" she wrote.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe \"Fox and Friends\" segment, which aired on January 22nd, was more than seven minutes long, and as sunny as a campaign ad. DeSantis appeared with Henry Sayler, a hundred-year-old Second World War veteran who was to receive the milestone vaccine, and boasted about how swiftly his state was vaccinating seniors. The host Pete Hegseth said, \"What are you doing differently that's allowing you to vaccinate so many more of the vulnerable population?\" DeSantis replied, \"We are working with pharmacies, we are working with hospitals. And if you doubled my vaccine allotment next week, I would be able to do double the vaccines.\" As he spoke, a chart appeared, detailing Florida's nationwide lead in vaccinations; it had been supplied by his office.\n\nAfterward, Gleason, the Fox producer, made it clear to DeSantis's aides that the network would welcome him back anytime. \"I honestly think he could host the show, with the chops we saw from him at the vaccine site with the 100-year-old veteran!\" she wrote.\n\nWith Trump exiting the White House, Fox needed a dominating personality to animate its news and talk shows. DeSantis's forceful presence and growing popularity seemed likely to yield high ratings. In the following months, e-mail traffic between Fox producers and DeSantis's office, produced in response to a public-records request, revealed an unusually collaborative exchange. DeSantis's aides could not only pitch stories, they could also shape the discussion. \"We are flexible on topic,\" the producer Beth Sullivan wrote to Meredith Beatrice. (Fox denied any favoritism, saying, \"Like all news organizations, we conduct pre-interviews with guests to ensure preparedness.\") Before one appearance, Beatrice wrote to Fox, \"Feel free to carry this announcement live on your feeds.\"\n\nThe e-mails suggest that the Fox News producers were intent on making DeSantis a national figure. Most of the stories focussed on amplifying his unorthodox approach to the coronavirus, but some traded on his nascent celebrity; one featured his three-year-old son's golf game. \"We see him as the future of the party,\" a booker named Karrah Kaplan wrote to Beatrice. The producers all but begged him to appear on their shows. Once, when he demurred, Kaplan protested, \"He made time for Tucker last night!\"\n\nIn the year after the Presidential election, Fox News producers asked DeSantis to appear at least a hundred and ten times, and he agreed at least thirty-four times. They posted some three hundred and forty stories about him online. The coverage drew attention from across the country. This March, DeSantis's campaign and his political-action committee, Friends of Ron DeSantis, reported raising a hundred and ten million dollars. Nearly forty per cent of it came from out-of-state contributors, including the billionaires Peter Thiel and Ken Griffin.\n\nThe more DeSantis appeared on Fox and similarly strident platforms, the more polarizing his rhetoric became. He refused to say that President Biden had been legitimately elected; he referred instead to the Biden \"regime\" and adopted the language of the President's cruder detractors. \"If you look at what we've done to fight back against Brandon so far, you know, we succeeded,\" he told the Fox News Radio host Guy Benson in March. \"The contrast between a doddering, quasi-senile President who has to have his press team clean up his remarks after every time he opens his mouth, versus somebody like me who's out there-I am very direct, I say what I mean, I mean what I say, I lead, and I get things done.\"\n\nLast January, a Jewish student was beaten up at a neo-Nazi rally outside Orlando; the next day, a group of men on a nearby overpass waved a swastika flag and placards with anti-Semitic slogans. Officials from around the state issued condemnations. DeSantis's response came from his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, who suggested that the incidents might have been faked. \"Do we even know they're Nazis?\" she mused on Twitter.\n\nAfter days of criticism from Democrats, DeSantis arrived at a press conference near Palm Beach; he was there to talk about the Everglades, but he took the opportunity to counterattack. \"I'm not going to have people try to smear me that belong to a political party that has elevated anti-Semites to the halls of Congress, like Ilhan Omar,\" he said.\n\nFor DeSantis, the moment exemplified a theatrical governing style, which involved subverting a venerable American political ritual: an elected official says something offensive, or fails to condemn something offensive, which triggers waves of performative indignation in the press-until the politician offers an apology. DeSantis instead turned moments like the one with the Nazis to his advantage; the more he defied tradition, the more it thrilled his supporters. On Twitter, one of them suggested, implausibly, that DeSantis's critics were as bad as the anti-Semites on the bridge: \"How about all cnts calling people racist, and essentially nazis for disagreeing with them? Desantis is probably the next president. Deal with it.\"\n\nAs DeSantis prepared to run for reëlection, he introduced a series of legislative measures that seemed calculated to spark similar fights, and to inspire fevered discussion outside of Florida. Many rested on flimsy legal grounds. One bill banned \"sanctuary cities,\" in which local governments refuse to coöperate with federal officials to deport undocumented immigrants; Florida has no such cities. Another bill created a police force dedicated to preventing election fraud; almost no fraud has been proved in recent Florida elections. DeSantis also dispatched a battalion of state law-enforcement officers to Texas to help stop illegal immigration, even though the nearest portion of the Mexican border is nearly nine hundred miles away. (As DeSantis saw off the troops, Fox covered the moment live.)\n\nSome of these actions appeared brazenly partisan. In 2020, following a summer of protests over the killing of George Floyd, DeSantis proposed an \"anti-rioting\" law that would make it a crime to block traffic during even a peaceful protest. \"When they start to do that, there needs to be swift penalties,\" he said. (In Florida, the George Floyd protests had been almost entirely peaceful.) The Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, but that September a federal judge declared it unconstitutional, saying that its definition of \"riot\" was so vague as to be open to partisan enforcement.\n\nIf DeSantis's legislative strategy was polarizing, that seemed to be the point. When attacked, he gave no quarter; he went after reporters aggressively, sometimes inaccurately, often in person. Unlike Trump, he spoke in clear, complete sentences, which made him harder to dismiss. His principal partner was his press secretary, Christina Pushaw. From early morning until late at night, seven days a week, Pushaw took to Twitter to trash anyone who presented the slightest critique of her boss. In February, immigration activists likened people trying to cross the Mexican border to the Cubans who fled Castro's dictatorship in the nineteen-sixties. DeSantis declared the comparison \"disgusting\"-a sop to Miami's influential Cuban community. When Thomas Wenski, the Catholic Archbishop of Miami, argued that \"no child should be deemed disgusting, especially by a public servant,\" Pushaw responded by posting a photo of Wenski over the caption \"Lying is a sin.\"\n\nPushaw, thirty-one, previously worked at Stand Together, a nonprofit organization backed by the Koch brothers, and spent time in the former Soviet Union, where she claimed to have witnessed the failures of socialism. Pushaw says that her job is \"debunking false narratives,\" which often entails describing DeSantis's opponents as pedophiles or socialists, and urging supporters to \"drag them.\" Her ferocity inspires cautious admiration. \"She is the most powerful woman in Florida,\" a consultant to several Republican candidates told me. \"Ron loves her, because she says things that even he won't say.\"\n\nDisdaining the \"corporate media,\" DeSantis and Pushaw often bristled under questioning. In March, 2021, when the Herald reported that some of the first vaccines in the state had gone to residents of wealthy enclaves where DeSantis donors lived, the Governor denounced the story as \"a really, really poorly executed hit piece.\"\n\nIt helped DeSantis that sometimes he was right. In April, 2021, \"60 Minutes\" reported that he had given the Publix supermarket chain a no-bid contract to distribute the COVID vaccine, after it contributed a hundred thousand dollars to his political-action committee. The segment featured video of a press conference, at which the show's reporter Sharyn Alfonsi suggested that DeSantis had engaged in \"pay to play.\" Viewers saw DeSantis tearing into Alfonsi: \"It's wrong, it's a fake narrative. I just disabused you of the narrative, and you don't care about the facts.\" But the unedited video, which later circulated online, showed DeSantis providing an explanation: in consultation with local officials, vaccine contracts had also been offered to several other retail and pharmaceutical chains.\n\nThe unstated premise of DeSantis's approach was that there was little point in trying to attract Democratic or even moderate voters; if he got his loyalists outraged enough, they would come to the polls in sufficient numbers for him to win. Stuart Stevens, an adviser to Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign in 2012, told me that Republican leaders have made a calculated choice in recent decades. As their reliable cadre of white voters shrank, they realized that they could either try to attract more minorities or try to motivate white citizens who rarely voted by tapping their racial insecurities. When Romney ran, he rejected the latter strategy, Stevens told me. Then came Trump, who embraced it and won. \"The G.O.P. has become a white-grievance party,\" Stevens said.\n\nDeSantis, he believes, is following the Trump playbook. \"To me, Ron DeSantis is a fairly run-of-the-mill politician who will do anything to get elected,\" he said. \"The problem is what the Party has become. It's a race to the bottom.\"\n\nThis past May, DeSantis scheduled a ceremony to sign a bill that, in the name of ballot security, would restrict access to the polls. \"Fox and Friends\" was granted exclusive access; all other outlets, including the Herald and the Tampa Bay Times , were excluded. Fox ran the ceremony live for seven and a half minutes.\n\nIn March, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker nullified large parts of the law, calling it a \"cynical effort\" to suppress turnout among Black voters. DeSantis dismissed the decision as \"performative partisanship.\" Legal experts say that DeSantis will likely prevail in federal appellate courts, which in recent years have given legislatures broad authority to rewrite voting rules.\n\nThe law was consistent with an array of Republican-led efforts to make voting more difficult, which typically discourage likely Democratic voters more than Republican ones. DeSantis and his allies in the legislature have launched a series of other initiatives to control the conduct of elections. In addition to creating the Office of Election Crimes and Security, they sharply curbed voting by mail and the use of third parties to register to vote and to cast ballots.\n\nEarlier this year, DeSantis broke with tradition to take control of legislative redistricting. For decades, after each new census, the Florida legislature has redrawn voting districts. The process usually involved a protracted political struggle, but when the legislature-Republican or Democratic-presented its plan to the governor, it was typically approved.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn March, DeSantis rejected the new map and proposed his own. The legislature's plan had created a new district that seemed likely to be won by a Republican, but DeSantis felt that it was not ambitious enough. His redrawn map eliminated two of four congressional seats held by African Americans and created four districts that seemed likely to turn white and Republican. DeSantis justified the changes by saying that he was eliminating illegal \"racial gerrymandering.\"\n\nBlack leaders were appalled. One of the congressmen whose districts were nullified was Al Lawson, who was first elected in 2016. He represents the Fifth District, which stretches from the small towns west of Tallahassee all the way to Jacksonville; its population is nearly half Black. \"DeSantis is not representing the interests of African American voters in the state of Florida,\" he said. \"He just doesn't do that.\"\n\nLast July, DeSantis travelled to St. Petersburg and encouraged Floridians to get a COVID vaccine. He'd received one himself, he noted: the single-shot Johnson & Johnson. \"These vaccines are saving lives,\" he said.\n\nBut DeSantis also signed a bill prohibiting businesses from requiring patrons to show proof of vaccination, even in such closed environments as cruise ships. He implied that people who wanted to protect themselves could simply get their own vaccine. If you argued otherwise, he said, \"you really are saying you don't believe in the vaccines, you don't believe in the data, you don't believe in the science.\"\n\nWithin a few months, any enthusiasm he had felt for vaccines seemed to have evaporated. Asked whether he'd received a booster shot, he would say only, \"I'm not gonna let that be a weapon for people to be able to use.\" DeSantis clearly recognized the political gamesmanship around vaccines. He also clearly recognized which team he was playing for. Glenn Morris, the director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute, at the University of Florida, told me, \"He's questioning the vaccine because he knows who his constituency is.\"\n\nIn September, DeSantis appointed Dr. Joseph Ladapo the state's surgeon general. Like DeSantis, Ladapo was an Ivy League apostate; trained at Harvard, he had often been at odds with the medical mainstream. Though he had served for several years on the U.C.L.A. faculty, his supervisor there declined to recommend him, writing, \"The people of Florida would be better served by a Surgeon General who grounds his policy decisions and recommendations in the best scientific evidence rather than his opinions.\" Ladapo had signed the Great Barrington Declaration and, early in the pandemic, had stood before the Supreme Court building to advocate such alternative COVID treatments as hydroxychloroquine, which has repeatedly been shown to be ineffective.\n\nWhen Ladapo took the job, he appeared with DeSantis and chided his colleagues in other states who recommended more stringent measures. \"We're done with fear,\" he said. \"It's over here. Expiration date. It's done.\" At the time, some fifty thousand Floridians had already died from the virus.\n\nDemocratic legislators were pleased to express outrage at Ladapo's views. In October, before his confirmation hearings, he entered the office of Senator Tina Polsky without a mask. Polsky, who was scheduled to undergo treatment for breast cancer, asked him to put one on. Ladapo instead offered to meet her outside. \"He was very condescending,\" Polsky told me. Ladapo maintained afterward that the mask inhibited his self-expression: \"It is important for me to communicate clearly and effectively with people. I can't do that when half my face is covered.\" (On hearing this, Polsky said, \"Don't doctors wear masks?\")\n\nLadapo gave vaccines only a lukewarm endorsement, even though they are widely understood to prevent more deaths and hospitalizations than any other tool. \"There's nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,\" he said. He also said that there was more to learn about their efficacy, adding, \"People need to continue to stick with their intuition and their sensibilities.\" By 2022, Florida ranked twenty-second in the nation in its percentage of vaccinated adults, making it one of the lowest-ranking large states.\n\nIncreasingly, DeSantis argued that Democratic-leaning states were run by oppressive governments eager to strip citizens of their rights. He boasted that Florida had received a stream of new arrivals, many of them fleeing states like California. (This was true, but misleading. In the course of the pandemic, California's population decreased by roughly three hundred thousand, and Florida's grew by about the same figure. But Florida had gained citizens at a similar rate nearly every year since the late nineteen-sixties.) \"Florida is a free state-we reject the biomedical security state that curtails liberty, ruins livelihoods, and divides society,\" DeSantis said earlier this year. \"These unprecedented policies have been as ineffective as they have been destructive. They are grounded more in blind adherence to Faucian declarations than they are in the constitutional traditions that are the foundation of free nations.\"\n\nBut DeSantis's insistence on preventing mandates sometimes violated the kinds of liberties he championed in his campaign book-former core principles of the Republican Party. Giving people the right to go to work unvaccinated also meant telling companies that they were not free to decide how to manage their employees. And preventing mask mandates meant telling town governments and schools that they were not free to enforce local standards.\n\nAfter DeSantis issued executive orders to stifle mask mandates, more than a dozen school districts and local governments defied him. An ally of his, a Republican legislator named Anthony Sabatini, filed at least fifteen lawsuits against COVID protocols. DeSantis also called a special session of the legislature to pass measures that made local governments drop their COVID -safety mandates. Not a single Republican voted against them.\n\nThe laws meant that schools had to open but were powerless to compel students to wear masks or to get vaccinated. Local officials were mystified and angry. \"People were dying all around me, including family members,\" Joy Bowen, a school-board member in Leon County, told me. \"I looked at this from a personal standpoint: I am taking care of my children, and I am taking care of other people's children who voted for me to keep their kids safe.\"\n\nGlenn Morris, the director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute, lamented the cost of the battle over COVID . \"The politicization of the vaccine was entirely unnecessary, and it's a tragedy,\" he told me. As the pandemic began, Morris and his colleagues at the University of Florida in Gainesville maintained close contact with the state Department of Health. Two or three times a week, the department shared new data, and a group of epidemiologists analyzed them, to inform research and to make recommendations to the state. \"When you have an outbreak, you have so many questions,\" Tom Hladish, one of the scientists, said. \"When will it peak? How bad will it be? What is the hospital burden? How many people are dead?\"\n\nIn June, 2020, the epidemiologists say, the health department terminated the relationship and stopped sharing data. (The department declined requests for comment.) \"The only reason you don't collect data is that you don't want to know what the data says,\" Derek Cummings, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida, said. \"The recommendations we were making were consistently at odds with the policy of the state.\"\n\nAt the university, a dashboard was set up to track the virus's trajectory through the campus-a sprawling place, with sixty thousand students. After the campus reopened, on DeSantis's orders, in the fall of 2020, the dashboard became an embarrassment to the Governor. Day after day, the university recorded the highest caseloads of any in the country. Mike Lauzardo, the deputy director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute, who oversaw the dashboard, was ordered to destroy coronavirus data by health-department officials, who accused him of improperly sharing information. An investigation by the university found no evidence of misconduct, and the data remained intact. Still, one of his colleagues told me, \"Lauzardo was feeling incredible pressure.\"\n\nOn several occasions, the university prohibited professors from testifying as expert witnesses in court cases that were brought against DeSantis's policies. Daniel Smith, a professor of political science, was one of three professors barred from testifying in a lawsuit against legislation that curtailed access to polls. Another professor, Dr. Jeffrey Goldhagen, was barred from testifying in defense of local governments that imposed mask mandates. The faculty senate found that professors were also discouraged from teaching or even researching controversial subjects like critical race theory. \"The policy was, we couldn't do things on campus that tick off the Governor,\" according to one of the faculty members who took part in the investigation.\n\nKent Fuchs, the university's president, declined to speak to me. In August, after the faculty senate gave his administration a vote of no confidence for its handling of the COVID -19 response, he announced that he was resigning. Daniel Smith and other professors sued the university and won; a federal judge said, \"U.F. has bowed to perceived pressure from Florida's political leaders and has sanctioned the unconstitutional suppression of ideas out of favor with Florida's ruling party.\"\n\nMuch of DeSantis's influence at the university appears to be exercised through Mori Hosseini, a real-estate developer who serves as the chairman of the board. Hosseini contributed more than a hundred and eighty thousand dollars to DeSantis's political-action committee and, according to a report in Politico, gave the Governor's wife a ride on his plane. The board has thirteen members, most of whom were appointed by either DeSantis or his predecessor, Rick Scott. Together, ten of them gave nearly a million dollars to DeSantis's PAC . \"Members of the board of trustees have told me that serving the Governor is their No. 1 task,\" Paul Ortiz, a history professor who leads the faculty union, told me.\n\nPerhaps the most telling evidence of DeSantis's influence is that Joseph Ladapo, the surgeon general, was hired to teach at the medical school. An investigation found that Ladapo was made a tenured professor without a full tenure evaluation or a search for other qualified candidates-all in violation of university rules. (The university denies this, saying that Ladapo completed a standard application process. Ladapo didn't respond to a request for comment.) The professorship, along with the position of surgeon general, gave Ladapo a combined salary of four hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars. The process was initiated by Hosseini, according to an e-mail he sent to the head of the university's medical network, which was obtained in a public-records request. \"There is only one reason that Ladapo was hired as a professor, and that is to support the Governor's policies,\" Goldhagen, the doctor who was barred from testifying, told me.\n\nIn January, DeSantis appeared at Florida's capitol for his annual State of the State address. He spoke for more than thirty minutes, in a celebratory mood. Florida was creating jobs and businesses at a robust pace. The state budget had a fifteen-billion-dollar surplus, despite one of the country's lowest tax burdens. \"Our economy is the envy of the nation,\" he told the assembled legislators.\n\nLink copied\n\nFor DeSantis, it was a rare moment of publicity for his policy agenda rather than for his fight with the liberal establishment. \"Compared to the culture-war measures, the mainstream stuff he has enacted is almost invisible,\" Jon Mills, a former House speaker and a co-director of the University of Florida's Center of Governmental Responsibility, told me. \"But there's a lot of it.\" Many of these measures have enjoyed broad support. DeSantis persuaded the legislature to create one of the country's first wildlife corridors and steered more than a billion dollars to Everglades restoration (even if much of the money came from Biden's infrastructure plan). He signed a measure to temporarily suspend the state gasoline tax, and raised salaries for public-school teachers.\n\nThe moment of comity with teachers didn't last, though. In March, DeSantis signed a bill forbidding educators to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity with students before the fourth grade; the law allows parents to sue school districts for violations. DeSantis said he was battling the imposition of \"woke gender ideology,\" and invoked his most reliable foils-\"these leftist politicians, corporate media outlets, some of these activist groups\" who \"support sexualizing kids in kindergarten.\" Pushaw, his press secretary, went further, suggesting on Twitter that opponents of the bill were pedophiles: \"You are probably a groomer or at least you don't denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children. Silence is complicity.\"\n\nBut, in his address at the capitol, DeSantis focussed on the fact that Florida's public schools had stayed open during the pandemic, protecting some 2.7 million students from the educational damage brought on by closings elsewhere. In carrying out his COVID policies, DeSantis said, he had faced down \"hysterical media,\" public ridicule, and an array of lawsuits. \"We have protected the right of our citizens to earn a living, provided our businesses with the ability to prosper, fought back against unconstitutional federal mandates, and insured our kids have the opportunity to thrive,\" DeSantis told the legislators. \"We were right, and they were wrong.\"\n\nIt is difficult to say with certainty which policies have worked best during the pandemic. Every responsible official has made trade-offs between keeping citizens employed, keeping them educated, and keeping them healthy. Analysts who sympathize with DeSantis's libertarian views maintain that the stringent and sometimes coercive measures taken by many of the country's largest states did not necessarily save many lives. A recent study by researchers at the University of Chicago, the Heritage Foundation, and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity compared states' death rates, adjusted for age and other risk factors. Florida came in twenty-eighth in the country. California ranked twenty-seventh, and New York forty-seventh. \"States that withdrew the most from economic activity did not significantly improve health by doing so,\" the study said.\n\nBut scientists I spoke to argued that adjusting for risk factors can be misleading; if your population is more vulnerable, they say, you should be more cautious, not less. And state-by-state comparisons are tricky, because populations and circumstances differ so widely. New York, for instance, had an enormous spike of deaths at the beginning of the pandemic, which has not recurred as precautions have become widespread. In Florida, deaths have tended to spike with each new wave of infections. In all, more than seventy-five thousand people died of COVID in Florida, one of the country's highest totals. Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, argued that as many as half of those lives could have been spared if DeSantis had mandated masks and vaccines. This month, as vaccines were approved for children younger than five, every state in the country rushed to order supplies-except for Florida, where DeSantis resisted until he was overwhelmed by criticism.\n\nThe thing that separated DeSantis from other governors was not just policy but tone. Interviewing scientists about COVID -19, it is easy to be struck by their humility before a disease that is still evolving. \"There's just so much we don't know,\" Nuzzo, of Brown University, told me. \"We are going to be studying this virus for a long time.\"\n\nHumility is not a tone that DeSantis ever struck. The politicization of the virus was perhaps inevitable in a country as polarized as America has become, but it almost certainly inhibited our ability to have an intelligent discussion about it. \"It's a tragedy,\" Bhattacharya told me.\n\nBut DeSantis's outrage attracted followers. In 2021, registered Republicans exceeded registered Democrats in Florida for the first time. DeSantis and the Republican Party enjoy near-total command of the state's political machinery. The Florida Democratic Party is so enfeebled that, in 2020, it applied to the Paycheck Protection Program for a loan, intended to help distressed small businesses survive the pandemic.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, when Trump was running for reëlection, he harbored persistent doubts that DeSantis, whom he viewed as his creation, was entirely his ally. DeSantis campaigned for the President, appeared at his rallies in Florida, and occasionally went to Mar-a-Lago. \"Ron will tell you he's doing everything he can for the President, and he'll sound believable,\" a lawyer who speaks regularly to both men told me at the time. But Trump was not convinced.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, Trump and DeSantis had been happy to lean on each other. When DeSantis joined a press event in the Oval Office and explained his COVID policies, Trump held up a chart that the Governor had brought along-an uncharacteristic supporting role.\n\nAfter Trump lost the Presidential election, he grew concerned that DeSantis no longer needed him. The following spring, Trump scheduled a rally in Sarasota-one of his first since losing-and invited DeSantis to join him onstage. People who know both men told me that DeSantis didn't decline, but he didn't confirm, either. \"There were alarm bells ringing-will DeSantis appear?\" a former Republican congressman told me. \"Ron didn't want to be onstage with Trump.\" At the last minute, a condominium tower in Surfside collapsed, and nearly a hundred people were killed. DeSantis rushed to the scene and missed Trump's speech. \"I've never seen anyone use Trump for his own purposes, but Ron used Trump,\" the former congressman said.\n\nTrump told me repeatedly that he and DeSantis had a \"very good relationship,\" adding, \"I'm proud of Ron.\" But others say that, as DeSantis's popularity grew, tension hardened into resentment. \"He won't kiss the ring,\" the political leader who sees DeSantis often told me. After the 2020 election, Trump made Mar-a-Lago his permanent home, but DeSantis rarely showed his face there. He looked busier than Trump, too: as a sitting governor, DeSantis could call a press conference or propose a new initiative anytime, whereas Trump was reduced to appearing on One America News and sending out e-mails.\n\nThe thing that grated most was that, as Trump considered running in 2024, DeSantis did not rule out a campaign of his own. The more plausible DeSantis has become as a nominee, the more people have speculated that he might decide to take on Trump.\n\nTrump told me that he was \"very close to making a decision\" about whether to run. \"I don't know if Ron is running, and I don't ask him,\" he said. \"It's his prerogative. I think I would win.\" In nearly every poll of likely Republican contenders, Trump still has a solid advantage: DeSantis's constituency was Trump's first. Trump seems to want to keep it that way. A consultant who has worked for several Republican candidates said that the former President had talked with confidants about ways to stop DeSantis: \"Trump World is working overtime to find ways to burn DeSantis down. They really hate him.\"\n\nBut Trump may have good reasons to sit out the election. \"He can do everything now that he could do when he was President, except shoot off missiles,\" the consultant who knows both him and DeSantis said. \"He's making a lot of money. That's the most important thing to him.\" Without Trump in the primaries, DeSantis would likely have an immediate lead. A nationwide survey, conducted by the pollster Tony Fabrizio, suggests that thirty-nine per cent of Republican voters would support him; his nearest challenger is Mike Pence, with fifteen per cent. Whatever discussions DeSantis is having about the subject are private, in part because the uncertainty is good for him. \"The moment he shows up in Iowa, the suspense is over,\" the consultant to Republican candidates told me. In the meantime, all of the consultant's colleagues are lining up to work for DeSantis: \"Everyone is trying to get a piece of him.\"\n\nDeSantis has remade the political landscape in Florida. It seems conceivable that he could attempt something similar on a national level-though some political observers wonder whether he could endure the countless hours of banal conversation required to succeed in a national election. \"He's going to have to go sit in a diner and listen to the local county chairman jerk off for twenty minutes,\" a Republican consultant told me. \"I don't know if he can do that.\"\n\nIt is possible that the only thing that will complicate DeSantis's ascent is his own impatience. At forty-three, he can afford to wait. But there is every indication that he doesn't want to. \"Ron has been told for four years that he's Trump's successor-that all the women want to sleep with him, and all the men want to be him,\" the consultant told me. \"Ron has heard way too many times, 'You're next.' \" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "When Ron DeSantis Forgot His Coat\n\nOn Tuesday, during a walloping Iowa snowstorm, less than a week before the caucuses, the Florida governor and U.S. Presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis, who's been campaigning doggedly across Iowa, flew to Tallahassee, delivered a speech, then returned without his coat. Schools were closed, cars veered into ditches, and DeSantis did his best to bond with locals over their strange, snowy ways. \"I actually do have a winter coat, and I forgot it,\" he told a group of highway-construction contractors, on Wednesday morning. \"So the next people that are coming up from Tallahassee, they're going to bring it. . . . But I think I'm going to need earmuffs and all that other stuff. So any tips you can give me . . .\"\n\nThe campaign was having trouble keeping warm. For months, DeSantis had languished far behind Donald Trump ; now, in a poll from Suffolk University, he was also trailing Nikki Haley , the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, whom he'd spent much of his time attacking. In the past week, DeSantis raced through several events in and around Des Moines, including trade conferences, a conservatives' breakfast, a Fox News town hall, and a CNN debate. At none did he seem to be enjoying himself. He was anxious and pugnacious, his smile labored, all while insisting that he loved being underestimated.\n\nThe contractors' event took place in a banquet hall of several dozen people, mostly men, mostly white, many burly or tattooed. DeSantis spoke in front of a screen flashing sponsors' names: a concrete-pipe association, a hardscape company, a sand-and-gravel concern. \"In Florida, we take all this stuff very seriously,\" DeSantis said, before launching into a story about hurricane damage to a Sanibel Island causeway. He pledged to get rid of Joe Biden's project-labor agreements, talked about cutting red tape, proposed two constitutional amendments, mocked New York and California, and suggested that he, as President, get a line-item veto so that he could nix things like \"promoting transgenderism in Bangladesh.\" He railed against electric vehicles, adding that salt water in Florida storm surges caused E.V.s \"to catch fire and burn the house down.\"\n\nWhen he opened the floor for questions, the room was silent. Eventually, a few people piped up, and DeSantis responded with a mélange of bummers. A man asked about immigration reform and international borders, and DeSantis invoked Houthi rebels, Sharia, and Mexican drug cartels before decrying Brooklyn's sheltering homeless migrants in a school (\"That will stop when I become President\"). A woman asked about improving mental-health services, and DeSantis mentioned veterans who \"commit suicide\" despite being \"pumped with pharmaceuticals.\" Then: \"All righty! Thanks so much! Happy New Year, everyone!\"\n\nAs DeSantis made his way out of the room, I asked people for their thoughts. Jerry Myers, of Osage, Iowa, who has a long beard and works for a truck-accessories business, told me that he broadly agreed with DeSantis but was skeptical of most politicians. They come to an event like this, he said, but in Washington they care about \"the two or three people in a private room, having a steak dinner.\" He went on, \"I want to get back to the days of Thomas Jefferson, where, when you were done serving in Congress, you shut up and went home to your farm. And you worked on your farm, and you talked to your neighbors and the people in your town. And then you went back the next year, took care of the problems, then shut up and came back to your farm. These guys work all year on keeping themselves in office.\" Myers's priorities include the economy, especially the three remaining factories in his town (animal feed, bug repellent, sock), and he's opposed to electric vehicles. \"Our current power grid can already barely support us,\" he said.\n\nIn the back of the hall, near a straight-backed state trooper, was a display of donated auction items: a Gatling gun, a Barbie-and-Ken doll duo, a kid's stuffed deer. I talked to several other attendees, none of whom was committed to caucusing for DeSantis. (Many weren't registered as Democrat or Republican, so couldn't caucus at all.) One young father said that he cared most about worker and public safety, economic stability, and the future for his three daughters \"at schools and sporting events.\" Thinking of shootings, I asked what he meant. \"If boys are playing girls,\" he said. A construction engineer who had grown up on a hog farm, and who wasn't planning to caucus, told me that, when it comes to voting, people need to do their own research-look at candidates' records, their lobbying affiliations. We talked about hog-farm literature; he mentioned \" Animal Farm .\" \"I just remember the horse being sent away,\" he said, of the steadfast workhorse who collapses from exhaustion. \"I knew he was headed to the glue factory.\"\n\nAfter Wednesday's CNN debate , DeSantis and Haley spoke Thursday morning at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit, tactfully separated by a keynote. The venue was the Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino, and DeSantis's bus-carrying the slogan \" FIGHT. WIN. LEAD. \"-was parked near the entrance. Inside, professionals in ethanol, yeast, soybeans, and so on exchanged hearty greetings, perused industry booths, and said things like \"Get the dehydrated-potato guys on it!\" DeSantis did his \"Forgot my coat\" bit, along with other standards: constitutional amendments, line-item veto, transgenderism in Bangladesh. He leaned hard on the Mafia-esque assertion that in Florida he had \"kneecapped\" E.S.G.-investing that takes into account environmental, social, and corporate-governance issues-which the Biden Administration supports. \"We need to just nix that once and for all,\" he said. Haley got more applause for her precise, calibrated performance, proposing draconian immigration measures (\"Instead of catch and release, we'll go to catch and deport \") while expressing strong support for Ukraine.\n\nIt was a moderate crowd: robust capitalists interested in sustainability. Ron Langel, an insurance agent and retired farmer from Templeton, Iowa, was an early investor in ethanol, in the early two-thousands-\"one of the best decisions I ever made financially\"-and was now curious about sustainable aviation fuel, a panel topic that day. \"I've been leaning Haley/DeSantis,\" he told me. He became briefly famous when he asked DeSantis, at a recent town hall, whether he thought the January 6th insurrectionists \"displayed patriotism, as some of them claim they did.\" (DeSantis said no, adding that the left and the media have \"really tried to politicize it.\") Langel doesn't like Trump's unwillingness to listen. \"He was a failure at that,\" Langel said. He believes that other Iowans feel the same way, but that \"many people are too afraid to speak out.\"\n\nTrump was mentioned often by attendees, though he's the one modern phenomenon that DeSantis, the conservative culture warrior, can seem reluctant to fight. Mike Carey, who works for a lending company that assists farmers, likes Haley, and thinks it's time to move past Trump. \"We need Trump's business acumen without the extracurriculars,\" he said. Jay Nelson, who works for a company that crushes soybeans, is from Perry, Iowa, where a teen-age gunman recently killed two people and injured several others at a school. Nelson's daughter, a student there, was unhurt. \"I am a registered Independent for a reason,\" Nelson told me. \"I vote the person, not the party.\" A buttoned-up attendee from a sustainable-fuels business expressed surprise at DeSantis's boast about E.S.G.-that he would \"nix\" it at the federal level. He shook his head, suggesting incredulity in the face of naïveté. \"E.S.G. is happening,\" he said. \"That's going to be a no-win battle for him.\"\n\nOne businessman told me that he wasn't sure what he thought about January 6th. \"It's confusing, because the media tells one narrative, and then if you get on to any social-media platform that gives you a different narrative-they couldn't be more diametrically opposed,\" he said. He thinks the insurrection started as a peaceful protest, and that the election had some voting \"irregularities.\" He didn't seem like he would have stormed the Capitol, but, like many other moderate Iowans I met, he also didn't seem like he would caucus.\n\nFriday morning brought extreme coat weather, earmuffs and all. As I headed to a DeSantis breakfast in Ankeny, driving through a blizzard on desolate white roads, NPR reported that Haley had cancelled her in-person event that day. This seemed reasonable. But the DeSantis affair, hosted by the Ankeny Republicans, was packed. By a backdrop that said \" NO EXCUSES. JUST RESULTS ,\" a local pastor led the room in prayer. Governor Kim Reynolds introduced DeSantis (\"a great dad and husband\"), and DeSantis took the stage in a fleece jacket, looking slightly buoyant. He announced that he had beaten the teachers' unions, beaten Anthony Fauci, beaten the Democrats. At the end of a short speech, he turned startlingly lyrical, invoking George Washington, the sacred fire of liberty, the Berlin Wall, and the beaches of Normandy. He responded to questions with vigor and arguments. Someone asked, movingly, about the connection between national security, border security, and support for Ukraine, and DeSantis snapped, \"Our southern border is not the same issue as that. All due respect.\" (We need to stop \"paying pensions for the bureaucrats in Ukraine,\" he added.) A question about education prompted a comment about \"union people\" who were \"going to the Bahamas, living their best life while kids suffer.\" A man who praised DeSantis and asked about \"passing on the baton of freedom for L.G.B.T.Q. issues\" got a peevish, dismissive response (\"I can't really speak to that\") and a scolding about D.E.I.-which DeSantis said stands not for diversity, equity, and inclusion but for discrimination, exclusion, and indoctrination-which got a burst of applause. A boy who asked about a favorite baseball memory got an anecdote that began, \"My buddy . . . his dad was the manager of the Red Sox. . . .\" Posing for photographs, DeSantis looked as if he were trying to keep his smile perfectly still while it attempted to crawl off his face.\n\nJohn Frank, a retired police officer, told me that DeSantis is the candidate best positioned to beat the Democratic nominee: \"I think it's going to be Michelle Obama.\" He gave me a shrewd look and explained his reasoning, which I hadn't encountered before. Logan Lindow, a pro-DeSantis student at Faith Baptist Bible College, in Ankeny, is from Florida. He said that DeSantis had dismantled bureaucracy in the state's foster-care system, enabling his family to adopt his siblings; Lindow is pro-life and pro-\"sovereignty of our border,\" and argued that, in Florida, legal Cuban immigrants vote Republican because they know the horrors of communism. Todd Stiles, the pastor who had led the prayer, thought DeSantis would be a \"great President.\" \"I'm a single-issue voter,\" he said. \"That issue is life.\" He wasn't happy with Haley's language: \"I don't know how you 'humanize' abortion. I know some people don't like single-issue voters, but, without life, what else do you have?\"\n\nMany of Iowa's evangelical leaders have endorsed DeSantis, though most of their followers remain pro-Trump. A bigger problem is that, unlike in 2016, when Ted Cruz won the state as a zealous social conservative, voters now seem more interested in who can win, period. Steve and Carmine Boal, who founded Ankeny Republicans, aren't hard-core DeSantis supporters. Steve, a retired C.F.O., is \"torn between Nikki and Ron\"; Carmine, a retired state legislator, is caucusing for Haley. \"She's the best to beat Biden,\" she told me. Carmine mentioned that, in recent weeks, she had talked to reporters from Germany, Finland, and other distant countries. I asked what the couple thought of DeSantis's response to the Ukraine question, and Steve furrowed his brow. \"I didn't hear him say what he would do. That was what bothered me,\" he said. \"He pointed out what was wrong. But what are you going to do ?\"\n\nDeSantis hadn't provided an update on his winter coat that morning, but he'd mentioned his young son's excitement about the snow, and smiled, sort of. \"I promised that, whenever we get a break in the action today, he's going to be able to do a snowball fight with me,\" he said. It seemed as fitting an image as any: snowball fights, like some debates and some primaries, can be boisterously combative and occasionally ruthless, but rarely produce a victor of consequence. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why Ron DeSantis Doesn't Have a Prayer in Iowa\n\nNow and then on the campaign trail you catch a glimpse of something that reminds you of the politics of the past.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, while I was in a crowd waiting for a Ron DeSantis event to begin at a pub and live-music spot called the Thunderdome, in Jasper County, Iowa, an evangelical leader named Bob Vander Plaats happened to walk across the front of the stage. Vander Plaats had his body turned away from the crowd- Creedence Clearwater Revival was playing, neighbors were greeting one another, he was just trying to get from here to there-but some people at the front noticed him and there was a burst of applause. Vander Plaats is silver-haired and schooner-smooth, and he gave a confident little wave of acknowledgement, as if he was sure that political power in the Republican Party still flows from the evangelical grass roots up-as if it were still 2004-and not (as has been the case more recently) from Donald Trump down. Vander Plaats had recently endorsed DeSantis, triggering a spiteful feud with Trump, who wrote on social media that Vander Plaats is \"more known for scamming Candidates than he is for Victory.\" When it was Vander Plaats's turn to take the mike onstage, he said, \"Donald Trump has been a friend of mine for well over a dozen years. It's getting harder.\" At this bit of pointed understatement, the crowd cheered.\n\nVander Plaats, who runs a political organization called the Family Leader, has never been an elected official, but he occupies a unique place in social-conservative politics-he was billed by the campaign as \"Iowa kingmaker,\" which he has often been called. Even when speaking about Trump, Vander Plaats was also giving a sermon on the theme of humility. \"I'm looking for someone who fears God,\" he said. \"Because the fear of God is the beginning of all . . .\" Here he paused, and the crowd intoned, \"Wisdom.\" Vander Plaats went on, \"In our country right now we need someone to fear God. We don't need someone to believe they are God.\"\n\nDeSantis's task in Iowa has always seemed straightforward: he just had to be Ted Cruz. In 2016, Cruz had campaigned in the state relentlessly, drawing on its deep evangelical tradition, and had beaten Trump by five points. Cruz's chief strategist in that race, Jeff Roe, is now one of DeSantis's most prominent advisers, and the Florida governor has followed the same blueprint, taking a very hard line on abortion and other social issues and campaigning so relentlessly across Iowa's small towns that Jasper County had been, until Saturday, the only one of the ninety-nine counties in the state that he had yet to visit. Even for those political observers unimpressed by DeSantis's stump presence or underwhelmed by his indecisiveness about how to take on Trump, the 2016 example seemed to set an appealingly reachable bar. We weren't talking about Ronald Reagan. Even if you were a pretty run-of-the-mill retail campaigner, surely it wasn't too much to ask of an aspirant to the Presidency of the United States that he match Ted Cruz.\n\nConservative leaders in Iowa have done their part. The endorsements around the State Capitol have all gone DeSantis's way: The popular governor, Kim Reynolds, the state House majority leader, and the state Senate president have come out for him. Mike Pence and Tim Scott, the other two Presidential candidates with some claim on the evangelical vote, had dropped out. When Vander Plaats announced before Thanksgiving that he was endorsing DeSantis (Politico had been reporting on the \" Vander Plaats primary \" since the summer), it seemed to cement the Florida governor's position as the champion of Iowa's social conservatives.\n\nThose social conservatives had won big legislative margins in the 2022 midterms that had gone against Republicans in other states, and they had used their majority to pass a \"fetal heartbeat\" bill, outlawing most abortions after around six weeks, which in effect comes close to an outright ban. DeSantis had signed a nearly identical bill in Florida; Trump has criticized these measures as too extreme, saying they would backfire on Republicans. So the true believers in Iowa had a substantive reason to turn away from the former President, too.\n\nIt was a highly self-selecting crowd at the Thunderdome-people willing to spend a couple of hours of their Saturday at a DeSantis campaign event-but, as I walked around chatting, I did get the impression that the fetal-heartbeat contretemps had given some Trump-skeptical conservatives something to point to, evidence that the former President really wasn't on their side. I spent a few minutes talking with Jon Dunwell, an evangelical minister who, in 2021, won a state House seat that had been held by Democrats for decades. Dunwell, who, once in office, had sponsored the heartbeat bill, isn't as smooth as Vander Plaats, but he has an intensity of purpose that I recognized from the Bush-era religious right, too. When Trump had turned against the fetal-heartbeat bills, Dunwell said, \"I was shocked. I mean, my jaw dropped. I don't get it. I look at some of my fellow-legislators-there are a few who support Trump who are also pro-life-and I just don't get it.\" He had endorsed DeSantis. Of Trump, he said, \"If he's willing to compromise on something as important as life, what else is he willing to compromise on?\"\n\nThe point of the Jasper County event had been to commemorate DeSantis's completing \"the full Grassley,\" as everyone seemed to have agreed to call it, in honor of the ninety-year-old Iowa senator Chuck Grassley, who has made it his practice to visit every single county each year. People said the phrase \"the full Grassley\" so much that you figured an intern backstage had organized a drinking game. Highlighting this made sense from several points of view, including character: whatever else you might think of Ron DeSantis, he does not lack doggedness. The crowd was healthy-maybe two hundred people-but more notably it was mobbed with press, who kept assertively asking voters questions they didn't really know the answer to, namely how they thought DeSantis could beat Trump.\n\nThe setting also seemed to beckon a quality that DeSantis does very much lack, which is folksiness. The plan seemed to be that the candidate would reminisce about all the charming things he had seen on the campaign trail, and all the personal connections he'd made. Onstage, DeSantis kept consulting a list of such visits, but he was short on detail and emotion, making it sound like he was narrating someone else's scrapbook, or possibly just reciting driving directions. \"When we were in Audubon County, my kids and Casey and me went to this big large bull statue, which I think is the largest bull statue in the entire world, and we got to get some good pictures with that, which was a lot of fun,\" DeSantis said. \"Casey, me, and the kids, when we visited Sac County, we saw the world's largest popcorn ball. Quite a sight.\" On it went. \"We were in Chickasaw County . . .\"\n\nOn some level, all of that is fine. No one comes to see Ron DeSantis for the charm. The theory of DeSantis's political persona has always been that Trump proved that what conservatives really want is just a fighter, someone who understands that the culture wars are constant and will constantly contest them. That had been part of the intent when DeSantis staged a series of media-friendly conflicts beginning in 2020: with Anthony Fauci over COVID , with Martha's Vineyard over migrants , with Disney over trans people, with his own state's universities over race and gender. In 2022, that worked-after DeSantis won a sweeping and much-covered reëlection victory in Florida, he was polling, by the turn of the year, close to Trump. But, in 2023, DeSantis has not only had to fight the culture war each day on Fox News but explain why he would be a better choice than Trump. He has also, generally, been hesitant to criticize the former President, even as his debate and stump performances have been underwhelming and his polling has collapsed. Nationally and in Iowa, he is running about thirty points behind Trump and roughly even with Nikki Haley . Meanwhile, his campaign has concentrated more and more of its resources in Iowa, has fired several high-ranking officials, and is reportedly trying to pivot from television ads to a turnout operation. The social-conservative play in Iowa is beginning to feel like his last real shot.\n\nSo my ears perked up when, in her introduction, his wife, Casey, said that each morning, along with his coffee, her husband puts on \"the full armor of God and the shield of faith.\" Across the room, I could see Vander Plaats paying close attention. Would DeSantis deliver his own sermon? Instead, the Governor talked through his memories of Iowa, then recited the high points from his tenure in Tallahassee, emphasizing his own relentlessness, and never talked about abortion once. Why take a radical position on reproductive rights, which will surely damage him if he gets to a general election, and not mention it to an audience of Iowa evangelicals? DeSantis seemed basically unbudgeable. Eventually, he made his case against Trump. It was about efficacy. \"I've been very frank with, you know, my views on President Trump's campaign where he's campaigning on things that he promised to do in 2016 and didn't deliver,\" DeSantis said. \"And he's doing the same promises, build the wall, drain the swamp, special counsel for Democrats. . . . The problem is, almost everything good that was done was reversed by Biden on Day One.\"\n\nFor those who want Trump beaten in the Republican primary, it is getting alarmingly late. DeSantis's supporters argue that he would win a general election that Trump would lose, but each new poll that shows him trailing badly undermines that claim. In Iowa, DeSantis has a clear opportunity: an electorate that has always been skeptical of Trump, no religious-right alternative, and a local political establishment that is in his corner. But they still need a candidate who can provide some contrast with the former President. DeSantis's bus, parked outside the event, was emblazoned with the slogan \"Fight. Win. Lead.\" Like his campaign, DeSantis has internalized the notion that what voters want is someone who will fight just as hard on their behalf as Trump. The more he sticks to that, the more he sounds like the former President's mini-me. Maybe that's the problem. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "HBO Max Becomes Max, Ron DeSantis Becomes . . . Rhonda Santis?\n\nTwo weeks into his Presidential campaign, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, has been exposed as a flip-flopper. For years, it turns out, he has been toggling between pronouncing his name \"Duh-Santis\" and \"Dee-Santis.\" When Fox News tried to get to the bottom of things, the Governor only complicated matters. \"Listen, the way to pronounce my last name?\" he said. \"Winner.\"\n\nIn politics, names can be just as important as slogans. Was America ever going to elect a Dukakis? Perhaps DeSantis is worried that \"duh\" implies slowness, or a taunt. But \"dee\" pulls his mouth into a sort of smile, which is not among his best expressions. It also whispers of wokeness: de fund, de carbonize, de colonize. (Though there's also de certify the election.) According to the Tampa Bay Times , he was always Ron Dee-Santis until his wife, Casey, decided that she liked it the other way. He's been in limbo ever since. \"It's syllabolic,\" Donald Trump, who sometimes calls the Governor \"Rob,\" said recently. \"Wants a syllabolic name.\"\n\nOne benefit of the DeSantis confusion was that it primed lawmakers for another nomenclatural switcheroo. Last Tuesday, the New York State Senate voted to re-add \"Tappan Zee\" to what's officially the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. Over the years, there have been other proposed names for the river crossing, including the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Bridge (that's ROSE-uh-velt, not RUSE-uh-velt), but, colloquially, it's always been just \"the Tappan Zee\"-until the junior Governor Cuomo, Andrew, sneaked the \"Mario\" renaming into a bill in 2017. \"People feel as though something of their own was stripped away from them in a deeply unfair manner,\" James Skoufis, the new bill's sponsor, said a few minutes after Wednesday's vote. Skoufis (SKOO-fiss) said that this re-renaming was nothing like DeSantis's waffling-\"He's got to figure out how to pronounce his own name\"-but then he dropped a Tappan Zee bombshell. \"The Native American pronunciation is 'tuh-PAN,' \" he said.\n\nWho could keep up? Even professional pronouncers are reeling. \"NPR does not have a position on the bridge that crosses the river as part of the Thruway,\" Tony Cavin, the outlet's managing editor for standards and practices, said the other day. As for DeSantis, Cavin said, most broadcasters have used Duh-Santis. But NPR is a Dee-Santis outfit. \"We had some people who reached out to his office a few months ago, and were told it was Dee-Santis,\" Cavin explained. \"It's uncharted territory,\" he went on. \"We wish he would just tell us what it was.\"\n\nThis called for an expert. \"There are maybe thirteen thousand DeSanti in the United States,\" Mark DeSantis, a one-time Republican candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh, said. \"It's always been Duh-Santis.\" But rogue Dee-Santises abound. Joe DeSantis, a basketball coach and commentator, generally goes by Duh-Santis. But, he acknowledged, \"the more formal it is, the more I'm gonna say Dee-Santis.\" He added, \"At my stage in life, I don't really care. It's not a big deal. But, lemme tell you, there's a third way. Are you ready? Da-Sannis. I will never say that.\" He then mentioned a heretofore unknown variant: \"Once in my life, I gave my name on the phone as Joe Duh-Santis. They said, 'Joda Santis?' \" Could it be that the Governor just doesn't want to be called Rhonda?\n\nLink copied\n\nPrefixes, plosives, portmanteaus: these are times of sylabollic confusion. One day, Facebook; next day, Meta. Football teams, M. & A.s, pronouns. DeSantis may be a flawed messenger for the virtues of self-identification, but you take the allies where you can get them. Even our cultural bedrocks are in flux. The past few years have brought clarifications from Adele (\"uh-DALE\"), Brendan Fraser (like \"razor\"), and Ariana Grande (rhymes with \"candy\"). Ralph Fiennes, van Gogh, Steve Buscemi, Rihanna. Lindsay Lohan was briefly \"LOW-in\"; she's now back to \"LOW-han.\" Denzel Washington is sometimes \"DEN-zil.\" Nobody says \"Nabokov\" with any conviction. The writer actually accepted multiple pronunciations, but never NA-bah-kov, which was used by Sting in \"Don't Stand So Close to Me.\" (\"A despicable gutterism,\" the writer once said, of that variation. Incidentally, he went on, the first name is Vladimir, \"rhyming with 'redeemer.' \")\n\n\"Naming is so important,\" Simon Dixon explained recently. He would know: he's a co-founder of DixonBaxi, the branding firm that oversaw the shortening of \"HBO Max\" to \"Max.\" Dixon said, \"If you have naming that is torturous, or overlapped, or is a confluence of several brands, what happens is you confuse the content.\" He liked \"Max\" because it's simple and flexible, and it combines different portfolios without perplexing people too much. \" 'Max': it's an energetic word,\" he said. \"It's very short. It's easy to say in most languages.\" There was something about the cks sound, as in \"Netflix,\" that conjured a ticking film reel: \"Sometimes there's a subjective magic.\"\n\nDavid Zaslav, the C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Discovery, viewed the \"Max\" rebrand in objectively rapturous terms. \"For our company, this is our rendezvous with destiny!\" he pronounced. Experienced Zaslav watchers may have noticed that he was engaging in a meta form of branding, a tagline within a tagline. \"Rendezvous with destiny!\" was the exact phrase he used, last month, to rally embattled employees at CNN (a Duh-Santis network), and, a few years back, to warn the world about a shark-overfishing crisis.\n\nDixon, for his part, advised against change for change's sake. For instance, people call the bridge \"the Tappan Zee.\" Why fight it? \"And, if it's said in a New York accent, it sounds cool,\" he said. Did he have any advice for DeSantis? Dixon thought he should drop the \"winner\" shtick. As for the name, he said, \"Dee-Santis is more definitive, it sounds more like a leader. Duh-Santis doesn't. So, at some point, I think he will either do some research or just have a gut feeling.\" Neither is likely to make or break his candidacy. But do you ever know, really, when you're going to rendezvous with destiny? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Ron DeSantis promised to champion a new, expansive conservatism. To understand exactly what that would look like, you only need to look to Florida itself.\n\nThis legislative term, the governor and his fellow Republicans waged culture wars everywhere from the classroom to the bathroom to Disney World , making the state a pioneer of some of the most extreme right-wing policies in the US.\n\nDeSantis's legislative agenda in Florida - which he has framed as a \"blueprint\" for America - has targeted immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, Black Americans , and women, as well as the corporations who come to their defense. And state lawmakers have advanced DeSantis's own political career at the expense of transparency and accountability. That's all been done in the name of wooing an activist GOP base, which still loves former President Donald Trump and has given him a historically large lead in Republican primary polls.\n\n\"What's been happening ... in Florida should scare every single person across the entire country,\" US Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) said in a press call. \"Gov. Ron DeSantis running for president and even being within striking distance of the Oval Office should frighten anyone who values democracy, voting rights , civil rights, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nMany of the Florida laws passed this session, which concluded earlier this month, go further even than other red states. Proposals banning gender-affirming care for minors and establishing a six-week abortion ban, for example, impose harsh new restrictions that could have severe consequences on those seeking such care in the state. Immigration proposals targeting undocumented people have also inspired fear among the roughly 772,000 undocumented immigrants in the state, and prompted some to leave.\n\nThe attacks on LGBTQ rights and Black Americans via policies that restrict the teaching of systemic racism and trans people's ability to use bathrooms have been so harsh that civil rights groups like the NAACP and Equality Florida have cautioned people against traveling to the state. Some of those groups are challenging laws DeSantis has signed in court.\n\nDeSantis has nevertheless doubled down on those policies.\n\n\"I think that the culture wars are front and center right now. People are talking about it more than economic issues, more than national security , foreign policy. So I think DeSantis has set himself up nicely,\" said Brendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist based in Texas.\n\nA representative for DeSantis's office did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIt's not clear that pursuing an ultraconservative agenda actually serves DeSantis politically in the long-run. Florida Republicans have legislated so far to the right that there is concern among some GOP donors that DeSantis has gone too far and alienated voters who might have otherwise supported him in a general election.\n\n\"There's a certain anti-Trump segment of the donor class has lined up with him, but another that is still looking for a candidate,\" said Robert Cahaly, senior strategist and pollster at the Trafalgar Group and former Republican political consultant.\n\nHere's how Florida lawmakers have enacted DeSantis's vision this session.\n\nDeSantis has been a key figure behind the national Republican campaign against LGBTQ rights , particularly that of children, with some of Florida's policies being the first of their kind in the nation. Those policies serve a practical purpose for the GOP: They allow them to perform opposition to the \" woke left\" and ensure their social conservative backers show up to vote - even after the religious right achieved its decades-long goal of overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nAs Vox's Rachel Cohen explained, Florida is among the states that have approved a very stringent abortion ban, which significantly curbs people's access to the procedure. It joins other Southern states in harshly curtailing reproductive rights in the region, eliminating Florida's status as a destination for people seeking out such care.\n\nSome Republican donors are concerned the decision to move forward with such an extreme abortion ban will cause DeSantis to face political blowback as he moves on the national stage. Although restrictions on abortion have been a chief focus of some conservative voters, voters overwhelmingly supported abortion access during the 2022 midterms , and there are signs protecting abortion access will be a salient issue in 2024.\n\nIn addition to curbing education about LGBTQ rights and identity in schools, several of the Florida legislature bills have centered on limiting discussions about diversity and race. As Vox's Fabiola Cineas explained , such measures follow a state push to reject the teaching of the AP African American Studies course in Florida.\n\nLegislators approved a wide-ranging slate of immigration policies, which severely limit the ability of undocumented people to both work and travel in the state. These hardline proposals are intended to establish DeSantis's credentials on an issue national Republicans have repeatedly hammered Democrats on.\n\nDeSantis's proposals have been slammed by immigration advocates, who note that the policies could severely hurt the state economically and drive its residents away.\n\n\"As fear becomes the norm in immigrant communities, a lot of these migrant workers will start leaving the state and looking somewhere else,\" Samuel Vilchez Santiago, the Florida state director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, told Vox's Christian Paz .\n\nIn addition to the expansive immigration package it approved, the legislature also passed a law that's expected to harm Chinese immigrants in the state, with some local activists also telling Vox that people are considering moving as a result.\n\nThis law has raised fears of racial profiling of Chinese immigrants in the state overall and has already been challenged in court by the ACLU for being discriminatory.\n\nDeSantis has quietly catered to gun rights activists by loosening Florida's gun laws and invoked what he describes as a \"tough-on-crime\" agenda that he has positioned as a model for the country, even though it's not clear that crime is lower in Florida than in some of the blue cities he's criticized.\n\nThe Florida legislature has propped up DeSantis's battles against what he calls \"woke\" corporations that embrace progressive social justice policies, including Disney, the state's largest taxpayer.\n\nFlorida legislators have passed bills changing the state's election laws and public records requirements in a manner designed to politically benefit DeSantis.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

      "text": "Why Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis are debating each other, explained\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe thirst for attention is real.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nIn what appears to be a blatant attention grab by both politicians, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have agreed to debate one another on live television this week. Given the fact that the two aren't actually competing head-to-head in an election, it's a somewhat confusing event and one that is ultimately an opportunity for both to raise their national profiles and score some political points.\n\nA debate like this is rare: It's not common that politicians who aren't running against one another would attempt to do such a public face-off. Although DeSantis is vying for the 2024 Republican nomination, Newsom has already expressed his support for President Joe Biden and said he won't be running this cycle.\n\nThat said, both politicians clearly feel like they have something to gain from this spectacle. For Newsom, who first proposed this debate in September 2022 , it's a chance to directly confront Republicans and to buoy his political ambitions down the line. For DeSantis, it's an attempt to try to get a breakout moment and deflect the attention from Trump as his 2024 presidential campaign has continued to stall.\n\nThe event, which has been dubbed \"The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate\" will take place on Thursday, November 30, at 9 pm ET, and last for 90 minutes. It will be moderated by Fox host Sean Hannity, and air live without a studio audience. Topics the two governors are expected to cover include: \"the economy, the border, immigration, crime, and inflation,\" according to Fox. Viewers can tune in to Fox News Channel to watch or FoxNews.com , if they have a cable subscription.\n\n\"I think for both of them, it's simply a chance to get attention,\" says David Barker, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \"DeSantis has a lot more to lose, because if he fares poorly he might as well go home. But right now, he has to take chances because if nothing changes he's going to go down in flames to Trump.\"\n\nThe short answer is that this gives both Newsom and DeSantis a way to increase their national profiles and a platform to appear as fighters for their respective parties. Additionally, it builds on a longstanding feud between the two, which has been simmering for months as Newsom has confronted DeSantis over discriminatory rhetoric toward minorities and women, and lax policies on gun control.\n\nAs Politico's Jeremy White has explained, it's been useful for both men to use the other as a foil as a way to show how committed they are to their own respective bases.\n\nThe two governors also have their own individual reasons for wanting to participate. Although he's vocally expressed his support for Biden in the upcoming election, Newsom has long been rumored to be interested in higher office and positioned himself as a rising star in the Democratic Party. The debate against DeSantis keeps Newsom in the spotlight and helps bolster his image as a key champion for Democratic positions ahead of the 2028 elections.\n\nAdditionally, it enables him to take a more combative approach to Republican positions, after frequently criticizing his party for not being aggressive enough. \"We're getting crushed on narrative. We're going to have to do better in terms of getting on the offense and stop being on the damn defense,\" Newsom told CBS News ahead of the midterms last year . Since then, he's appeared on Fox News to fact-check Republican claims on topics like immigration and launched a new political action committee that targets policies in red states.\n\n\"Gov. Newsom has been critical of the lackluster messaging and lack of aggressive hand-to-hand combat that he believes Democrats nationally need to engage in to push back against the tactics of Republicans. This is an opportunity ... to punch back,\" California Democratic strategist Steven Maviglio told Vox. Newsom has also described the face-off as an opportunity to tout the accomplishments of the Biden administration, which has approved of him moving forward with the debate.\n\nWhether this actually bolsters Biden in any way is an open question: Newsom could potentially be a helpful surrogate and use this opportunity to boost support and funding for the campaign, though it's also a chance to effectively sell himself.\n\nFor DeSantis, the debate is similarly an opportunity to show Republican voters that he can authoritatively push GOP stances on issues like abortion , LGBTQ rights, and crime. A chief critique of him up to this point has been his lackluster and often awkward campaign appearances, something he could try to combat via this debate. It's a way to try to convince Trump voters that he can be an effective messenger and confront a Democrat that many Republicans have long villainized.\n\n\"Ron DeSantis is debating Gavin Newsom to highlight the choice facing American voters next year. The left wants America to follow the path of California's decline - Ron DeSantis wants to reignite the American Dream, restore sanity, and ensure our nation's best days are ahead,\" read a memo the DeSantis team sent donors, first reported by CNN .\n\nNewsom and DeSantis have been feuding for some time, with the California governor condemning many of the Floridian's actions, including busing migrants, and the Floridian governor slamming California cities like San Francisco for being too liberal.\n\nFollowing months of back-and-forth, Newsom officially challenged DeSantis to a debate in September 2022 via a tweet . \"Since you have only one overriding need - attention -let's take this up & debate,\" Newsom wrote at the time. \"I'll bring my hair gel. You bring your hairspray. Name the time before Election Day.\"\n\nNewsom then officially agreed to the debate during an appearance on Sean Hannity's show on Fox in June 2023 . And DeSantis did the same in early August 2023. \"Let's get it done. Just tell me when and where. We'll do it,\" he said.\n\nThe most interesting thing to watch in this debate is probably DeSantis's performance, which could either give him a much-needed boost or fully sink an already struggling campaign. If DeSantis can effectively go after Newsom on progressive proposals in California and the state's struggles with issues like homelessness, it's possible that could help convince some Republican voters to give him another look.\n\n\"Desantis's campaign is floundering. He needs something, apparently anything, to illustrate his fight against the 'enemy,'\" Republican strategist Chip Felkel told Vox.\n\nThe stakes are much higher for DeSantis, who needs to show that he can hold his own against Newsom to be considered seriously by Republican voters. Newsom, meanwhile, mostly benefits from the exposure and the chance to go on the offensive against a major GOP candidate. Since he was comfortably reelected to his gubernatorial seat in 2022 and won't be up again for a few more years, there's far less immediate risk for him even if things don't go so well.\n\n\"He can defend his rhetoric and record and vision, and I'll do my best to defend mine and promote Joe Biden,\" Newsom told CNN .\n\nUpdate, November 30, 4:25 pm ET: This story was originally published on August 15 and has been updated to include details about how to watch the debate.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEven after receiving backlash from fellow Republicans, the Florida governor is tripling down on the state's controversial Black history standards.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nDespite strong backlash from Democrats and fellow Republicans, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is tripling down on his state's newly approved social studies curriculum guidelines that erroneously teach students that enslaved people \"developed skills\" that they could use for \"personal benefit.\"\n\nSince news of the state's new standards gained attention in mid-July, DeSantis has faced criticism - including from four of the five Black congressional Republicans, almost all of whom support former president Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.\n\n\"What slavery was really about was separating families , about mutilating humans and even raping their wives,\" said Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is also running for president. \"It was just devastating. So I would hope that every person in our country - and certainly running for president - would appreciate that.\"\n\nBut DeSantis is continuing to defend the standards. In a recent NBC interview this week, the governor stated that enslaved people \"developed skills in spite of slavery, not because of slavery,\" adding that \"it was them showing resourcefulness and then using those skills once slavery ended.\"\n\nIn the interview, DeSantis also defended the steps his administration has taken in the past year to overhaul various aspects of that state's education system. \"We've been involved in education, not indoctrination,\" he said. \"Those standards were not political at all.\"\n\nThe controversy is the latest in a string of education-related fights for DeSantis, including the state's rejection of the AP African American History course , the dismantling of the state's tenure system , and the conservative takeover of the small New College of Florida . With each move, DeSantis has attempted to model what he would do nationally as president.\n\nBut his latest comments have spotlighted his rocky presidential campaign - his approval rating among Republican voters stands at 17 percent in a recent poll with Trump at 54 percent - and how his strategy to antagonize liberals and fight \"wokeness\" may be backfiring. The controversy also highlights the Republican Party's sluggish gains among Black voters, who vote overwhelmingly Democratic, as it makes a rightward shift on race.\n\nOn July 19, Florida's state board of education approved new standards for African American history for instruction in kindergarten through high school classrooms. The state organized a working group to update the state's standards and ensure that they comply with HB 7, also known as the Stop WOKE (Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees) Act , which DeSantis signed into law in 2022 and states \"classroom instruction and curriculum may not be used to indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view inconsistent with the principles\" contained in the law.\n\nThe 19 pages of standards are benchmarks that determine what knowledge students should be taught. The kindergarten through fourth grade standards require students to identify Black people who have had a \"positive impact\" in politics, art, invention, and other areas. Beginning in the fifth grade, students start to learn about slavery through lessons on the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn the sixth through eighth grade, teachers instruct about the slave trade and slave revolts, among other topics. They also learn about how slavery was codified in the law. In these sections, teachers are guided to create lessons about the jobs enslaved people performed, including tailoring, blacksmithing, and agricultural tasks, and how the skills they learned could be used for \"personal benefit.\"\n\nThe high school standards are the most extensive, guiding teachers to produce lessons on everything from key Black figures to Black people's history of resistance and sacrifice.\n\nThough Republican legislators and the state's education commissioner celebrated the new standards, hundreds of teachers across the state, supported by education and civil rights advocacy groups, criticized them.\n\nBroadly, critics have said the standards are \"watered down\" and \"incomplete.\" Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association, told EducationWeek that the middle school standards don't make \"enough connections between the past and present.\" More specifically, the high school standards don't \"dive into Florida's efforts to keep segregation in place.\"\n\nOther critics told EducationWeek that new standards are limited in their coverage of ancient Africa, are missing key facts, and lack nuance, since they \"mimic instruction of U.S. history with more Black faces and without critical thought and analysis of concepts that are more typically a part of African American history and African American studies courses.\"\n\nAhead of the board of education's vote, teachers demanded that the standards be tabled to allow for revision. \"These new standards present only half the story and half the truth. When we name political figures who worked to end slavery but leave anyone who worked to keep slavery legal nameless, kids are forced to fill in the blanks for themselves,\" said Carol Cleaver, an Escambia County science teacher, at a meeting in Orlando ahead of the vote, according to the Tampa Bay Times .\n\nTwo standards in particular garnered national outrage. Critics identified as problematic the section of the middle school standards that states \"slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\" In response to this standard, Vice President Harris flew down to Florida to deliver a speech, stating, \"Adults know what slavery really involved. It involved rape. It involved torture. It involved taking a baby from their mother. It involved some of the worst examples of depriving people of humanity in our world.\"\n\nCritics also pointed to a section of the standards that highlights \"acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans but is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921 Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.\" According to critics, this standard whitewashes history and ignores the terror Black Americans faced.\n\nDeSantis has continued to say that a group of Black scholars developed the standards. But as NBC reported , a majority of the members of the group did not support the most controversial elements that were approved.\n\nThe standards are a natural extension of DeSantis's legislation. The Florida governor signed the Stop WOKE Act, which limits discussions about race in the classroom and at work. The law was written to ensure that white people don't feel guilt, shame, or psychological distress about racism.\n\nThe standards - and DeSantis's insistence on defending the lesson on how enslaved people gained skills to their \"personal benefit\" - are an example of what that law looks like in practice.\n\nThis time, the standards went too far for some Black Republicans. \"Slavery was not CTE! Nothing about that 400 years of evil was a 'net benefit' to my ancestors,\" tweeted Rep. John James, a Michigan Republican, referring to the acronym for career and technical education.\n\nBut in the party overall, Republican leaders have moved right on race, aligning with far-right figures who reject the idea that minority groups face structural bias. Political scientists who studied voters in the 2016 and 2020 elections in one study determined that the strongest predictor of who voted for Donald Trump was the belief that systemic racism is not a factor in American society. The second strongest predictor was the belief that women don't face systemic bias.\n\nDonald Trump, the current frontrunner, sat down for dinner with white supremacist Nick Fuentes in November. A number of Republican House members, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, spoke at a white supremacist gathering where attendees chanted \"Putin!\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville repeatedly refused to denounce white supremacists, calling them \"Americans\" instead. (After multiple interviews, he made a short statement that \"white nationalists are racists.\") Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona called Black people \"colored people\" on the House floor in July. (Crane says he \" misspoke .\")\n\nOther Republicans have dismissed racism. Though Scott rebuked DeSantis for his comments, the senator has repeatedly argued that racism is no longer a problem in America. During a June Fox News Town Hall , he said, \"When I hear people telling me that America is a racist nation, I got to say: Not my America, not our America\" - a statement he made despite having spoken extensively in the past about the racism he has faced, including repeatedly being pulled over for traffic stops by the police. Scott was pulled over seven times in one year.\n\nPresented with Scott's statement during the NBC interview, DeSantis responded, saying, \"Don't take that side of Kamala Harris against the state of Florida. Don't indulge those lies.\"\n\nDuring her trip to Florida, the vice president said she was there to denounce \"extremists\" who were forcing \"propaganda\" onto Florida students.\n\nDeSantis then invited Harris to debate the standards. Harris replied: \"There is no roundtable, no lecture, no invitation we will accept to debate an undeniable fact: There were no redeeming qualities of slavery.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis legislative session has been all about Ron DeSantis.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has leaned heavily on the Florida legislature this session to give him a launchpad for a 2024 presidential bid , which he is expected to announce in the coming weeks .\n\nMost recently, Republican lawmakers, who have supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature, have moved to protect DeSantis from Florida's exhaustive reporting requirements, shielding his dealings as governor from public scrutiny.\n\nRepublicans in the state Senate passed legislation that would eliminate the requirements to report his official travel and meeting logs. Florida Rep. Angie Nixon, a Democrat from Jacksonville, said that's designed to conceal his absence from Florida as he prepares to go on the campaign trail. In March and April, he had 21 days of scheduled travel, including for an international trade mission to Japan and Israel to shore up his foreign policy credentials. \"Floridians deserve someone who's going to be here and who's going to govern our state,\" she said.\n\nThe state Senate has also passed legislation to relax campaign finance reporting requirements for state political committees, which currently disclose their fundraising figures monthly. DeSantis's state political committee, Friends of Ron DeSantis , has almost $86 million in its coffers and raised roughly $3.7 million in March. Under the new bill, that committee would have to report on just a quarterly basis.\n\nBoth of those bills are going before the state House, which is expected to pass them.\n\nAnd the legislature is expected to move forward with legislation that explicitly allows DeSantis to run for president without having to resign from his position as governor, as may have been required by current Florida law. With the legislature scheduled to adjourn May 5, it's running out of time to do so and will likely attach the measure to a larger elections package.\n\nDeSantis's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThese bills on their own will likely have minimal impact on DeSantis's campaign, but they show how DeSantis, with the cooperation of his Republican allies, has been able to set the agenda this session in a way that serves his ambitions for higher office.\n\n\"Because of Republican supermajorities in both the House and the Senate and the lack of courage or principle in either house, the Florida legislature is completely in thrall to DeSantis,\" said Mac Stipanovich, a former Republican consultant in Florida who endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. \"It's embarrassing for the legislature and the antithesis of good government.\"\n\nIn addition to the actions taken to protect DeSantis and his seat as governor, the Florida legislature has been working this session to give him the conservative record he needs to win the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nDeSantis enacted a six-week abortion ban in the state despite the fact that it's unpopular with a big majority of Florida voters. It would effectively ban almost all abortions since most people don't know they're pregnant at that point and Florida law requires two in-person doctor visits with a 24-hour waiting period in between before a patient can obtain an abortion.\n\nDeSantis made Florida the 26th state to adopt permitless carry, appeasing gun rights advocates. The law, which goes into effect July 1, allows gun owners to carry a concealed weapon without a permit or without undergoing training under some restrictions. Previously, gun owners applying for a permit to carry a concealed weapon were required to undergo a background check, fingerprinting, and training, and to demonstrate competency by firing a gun in front of an instructor.\n\nA March University of Florida survey found that those measures are even unpopular with Republicans in the state, suggesting that DeSantis is playing more toward a national audience. More than 60 percent opposed both the permitless carry bill and the six-week abortion ban (though the survey did not specify that the bill included exceptions for rape and incest).\n\nDeSantis's crusade against LGBTQ rights, the subject of his ongoing war with Disney , has also continued with the Florida House passing a bill that would allow the state to take a child away from their parents if they have been \"subjected to or [are] threatened with being subjected to\" gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers or hormone treatments.\n\nThe list goes on with legislative attacks on faculty tenure , freedom of the press , young and minority voters , diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at universities, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Nixon said that Florida Republicans haven't done enough to address the state's property insurance crisis , despite passing an overhaul of the system in December, and its critical teacher shortage .\n\n\"The majority of these bills, unfortunately, have been put forth as red meat to his base,\" she said. \"He's creating these culture wars because he wants to use these talking points during his presidential campaign.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Florida governor is experiencing the growing pains of running a national campaign.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis can't seem to catch a break, despite entering the 2024 GOP primary two months ago favored as the candidate most likely to topple former President Donald Trump .\n\nIn just the last week, DeSantis's campaign finance reports have indicated that he's blowing through cash. There have been staffing shake-ups. Even his big mainstream media debut on CNN Tuesday was overshadowed by Trump's announcement that he could soon be indicted for his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. DeSantis remains more than 30 percentage points behind Trump on average in the polls.\n\nThe timing of the CNN interview was an unforeseen misfortune, much like the technical problems that plagued DeSantis's campaign announcement on Twitter Spaces. But some of what has gone wrong with his campaign stems from his own mistakes. The question is whether he can come back from his troubles given that it's still early days in the 2024 campaign.\n\n\"A presidential campaign is a lot different than a gubernatorial campaign. And his staff is just not measuring up in the same way that he's not measuring up,\" said Mac Stipanovich, a former GOP strategist in Florida who endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. \"His incompetence is compounded by his bad luck.\"\n\nDeSantis's latest campaign finance report , which came out last week, showed warning signs for the GOP hopeful. While he raised more than any other Republican candidate, bringing in $20 million, he has also spent almost $8 million since launching his campaign in late May. What's more, he isn't attracting the kind of grassroots donors that Trump has, with less than 15 percent of DeSantis donations coming in amounts of $200 or less.\n\nThe campaign has cut staff to keep costs down, suggesting that he hired too many people too early. And the kind of people he's hired tend to be \"obsequious\" at a moment when he needs the people around him to challenge the status quo, according to Stipanovich. There has also been some turnover in key roles, with top advisers Dave Abrams and Tucker Obenshain reportedly leaving the campaign for an outside group supporting DeSantis.\n\nHis allies have started publicly expressing doubts about his campaign. During a Twitter Spaces earlier this month, a top spokesperson for DeSantis's super PAC admitted that the campaign was \"way behind\" and called Trump the \"runaway frontrunner.\"\n\nHis agenda is under siege in his home state, with dozens of lawsuits having been filed against his policies , including controversial restrictions on undocumented immigrants in the state and his attacks on Disney . While he maintains he'll win out in the end, they are both a distraction and ammunition for his rivals. And the fact that he's suffered some early losses in a number of those lawsuits, which will likely extend beyond the 2024 election , won't help his pitch of bringing Florida's policies to the entire US.\n\nDeSantis is trying to assure voters and donors that he can turn things around. Though he's largely eschewed mainstream media in favor of friendlier right-wing media outlets, he's beginning to realize that's no pathway to the nomination. He sat down with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday. But it was clear that he wasn't in his comfort zone, avoiding questions on thorny subjects such as his support for a national abortion ban and ending the war in Ukraine .\n\n\"Now he has to go out and face the media and questioning from people who are not carefully vetted and carefully selected. And he doesn't do well at all because he has no practice at it,\" Stipanovich said.\n\nTo add insult to injury, news of a third potential Trump indictment stole DeSantis's thunder and was the first subject that Tapper asked him about - and it's certainly not the first time the governor had struggled to stand out over his one-time mentor. They've held dueling campaign events , and Trump has often tried to one-up DeSantis at critical moments for his campaign: for example, calling his botched 2024 announcement on Twitter a \" #DeSaster .\"\n\n\"Every time DeSantis raises his head, Trump steps on it, in terms of media coverage,\" Stipanovich said.\n\nIt may be a problem that DeSantis just can't rectify. The party has far from moved on from Trump, even if the donor class is eager to do so. And at the moment, there's no sign even a third indictment will change that.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDeSantis has ended a campaign that appealed to a particular kind of conservative elite - and not many others.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nIt's official: Ron DeSantis has put a fork in his presidential campaign. On Sunday, the Florida governor released a video announcing that he's quitting the race and endorsing Donald Trump for president.\n\nDeSantis had staked his entire run on the first-in-the-nation caucus: visiting all 99 Iowa counties and moving huge numbers of staff into the state. In the end, it was all for naught. He came in a distant second in a state he needed to win - or at least come extremely close - to have a chance at the nomination. Polls showed DeSantis as a non-factor in the upcoming New Hampshire primary, and his national numbers had been collapsing for months. After the dismal Iowa result, his campaign was finished in all but name; Sunday's announcement just made things official.\n\nThere are many reasons DeSantis failed, ranging from the candidate's awkward personality to his weirdly lavish spending on private flights . But there's also a more fundamental explanation: Ron DeSantis and his backers completely misread what the GOP electorate wanted.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign was fundamentally a product of a certain class of the GOP's elite: people who admired Trump 's willingness to break the traditional norms of American politics but saw him as basically déclassé or ineffectual. These are the sorts of conservatives who look admiringly at Hungarian autocrat Viktor Orbán , seeing his use of legalistic arcana to crush liberal opposition as a model for how to fight a culture war and win.\n\nObviously, most Republican voters aren't this hyper-ideological. But DeSantis and his allies theorized that the \"Trump but competent\" shtick would allow them to pull from all sides of the GOP electorate. By focusing on his \"culture warrior\" background - like his fights over Covid restrictions and Disney - DeSantis could win over a key portion of the Republican base. By seeming more competent and organized, he could scan as palatable to the traditional establishment.\n\nExcept it turned out that the kind of culture war politics DeSantis offered, an often-abstract assault on \" wokeness ,\" paled in comparison to what Trump served up. The MAGA base wanted Trump and all his hard edges: the bigoted rhetoric and all-consuming post-2020 election anger. The rump establishment bloc preferred Nikki Haley , sticking DeSantis in no-man's land. His campaign was appealing to a small niche of highly intellectual populist conservatives, but that proved to be just about it.\n\nThe MAGA faithful didn't want a pseudo-Trump gussied up for the GOP's elite. They wanted Trump and his \" retribution .\" DeSantis's failure to recognize this doomed him from the start.\n\nIn retrospect, DeSantis peaked in the months after the 2022 midterms.\n\nTrump-backed candidates in competitive elections had miserably underperformed expectations around the country, costing the GOP a Senate majority. DeSantis, by contrast, had cruised to reelection in what was recently seen as a purple state - leading him to emerge as the unquestioned chief rival to Trump among pundits and elite Republicans.\n\nAround that time, I argued that DeSantis did not represent (as some suggested) a return to the traditional GOP. Instead, DeSantis was an \" evolution of Trumpism , a new way of channeling the illiberal populist forces unleashed by the former president's rise to power in 2016.\" The two men represented \"two related but distinct versions of American right-wing populism: Trump its wild id, DeSantis its more calculating and intellectualized ego.\"\n\nDeSantis was betting that Trumpism could be separated from Trump: that enough of the GOP's radical factions wanted the right-wing populism without the chaos of the man who brought it to dominance in the party. He and his brain trust gambled on a DeSantis-style culture war against \"woke capital\" tapping into the same wells of grievance that Trump's attacks on immigrants and Muslims had done in the past.\n\nIf this bet were correct, then DeSantis would emerge as the only viable opponent to Trump. In that scenario, the old-guard establishment figures who wanted to move on from Trump would have no choice but to line up behind the Florida governor rather than one of their own (say, Haley).\n\nAt his high-water mark about in January 2023, it looked like there might be something to this theory: DeSantis had shaved the deficit with Trump down to 13 points in the national RealClearPolitics average . But in the coming months, DeSantis would enter free fall and never recover.\n\nThe reasons for his collapse point to weaknesses in the fundamental DeSantis theory of the GOP electorate.\n\nThe most obvious explanation is the four criminal indictments against Trump. In the week after the first indictment on March 30, Trump's lead over DeSantis increased by about 12 points - from 15 to 27 points - and only went up from there.\n\nThe indictments' impact on the race is so obvious that DeSantis himself cited it as the biggest problem for his campaign in a December interview.\n\n\"If I could have one thing change, I wish Trump hadn't been indicted on any of this stuff,\" DeSantis told the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody in a December interview. The indictments, he said, \"sucked out a lot of oxygen\" from the race.\n\nBut DeSantis is letting himself off too easy. The indictments were not some unpredictable force majeure: There had been ample signs for months prior that Trump was at serious legal risk. A competent campaign would have been able to exploit their chief rival being indicted four times to their benefit.\n\nYet the DeSantis team instead chose to defend Trump. After Trump's first indictment, DeSantis denounced \"the weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda\" by \"the Soros-backed Manhattan District Attorney.\" He even vowed to block an extradition request for Trump from Florida to New York if it came to that (which it never would). His response to the other, even more serious indictments was basically the same .\n\nViewed through the lens of DeSantis's overarching theory of the case, this seemingly bizarre choice made sense.\n\nDeSantis believed (correctly) that he couldn't win without a significant number of Republican voters who liked Trump and his brand of politics. Aligning with Democratic prosecutors and the feds against Trump would be anathema to anyone who bought into Trump's paranoia about stolen elections and the \"deep state.\" So DeSantis instead decided to attack Trump's prosecutors, suggesting only rarely and obliquely that the prosecutions might drag down Trump in the general election.\n\nThat DeSantis felt boxed in like this reflects a fundamental flaw in his campaign's premise. They assumed that Trump's supporters believed that Trumpism, as a movement, could be separated from Trump the man. Focusing fire on the bugbears of conservative populist intellectuals - abstractions things like DEI, ESG, and, above all, \"wokeness\" - would allow them to get at the base's populist sentiments and steal Trump's base out from under him.\n\nBut the GOP faithful were not like DeSantis's backers in the pundit and activist classes. For them, the cause of Trump is inseparable from the cause of the party. A clear majority of Republicans believe both that the 2020 election was stolen and, as a result, that the prosecutions of Trump for January 6-related crimes amount to political persecution.\n\nThis, in their minds, amounts to a crime of world-historical proportions: a plot against the legitimate president of the United States. It is the culmination, the centerpiece, of all the things Trump has been warning about for years: the various betrayals by \"elites\" when it comes to trade, immigration, crime, and the rest. This mattered to them far more than anything ongoing in Budapest or the Disney headquarters in Florida.\n\nIf you accept the basic premises of the Trumpist worldview, as DeSantis's campaign did, you have no real room to make the case against a second Trump nomination. What DeSantis billed as \"Trump but competent\" scanned to voters as \"off-brand Trump.\" And \"why off-brand when we can have the genuine article?\" is an unanswerable question for a political campaign.\n\nTo be fair to DeSantis, there's probably nothing any Republican could have done to beat Trump in 2024 .\n\nNikki Haley campaigned as an establishment type friendly to MAGA, but her recent polling surge hasn't even come close to DeSantis's January 2023 peak - when he was still trailing Trump by 13 points. Neither Chris Christie, who attacked Trump head on, nor Vivek Ramaswamy , who acted like a Trump campaign surrogate, made a serious impact. Trump's power over the Republican Party is too strong for any kind of campaign message to break.\n\nThat means that DeSantis simply may have been too early. For his approach to succeed, DeSantis needed to campaign as the heir apparent to Trump's movement. But the heir can only rise to power when the king is out of the picture. Had the 45-year-old DeSantis waited until Trump was sidelined by the inevitable march of time, it's possible things might have been different for the Florida governor.\n\nNow DeSantis's political future is in doubt. The disastrous performance during the campaign has tarred him as a loser; the media narrative that DeSantis is awkward and unable to relate to voters is largely set in stone. The ignoble end of his campaign after Iowa will only deepen these perceptions, ones that will take DeSantis years to shake (if he can in fact shake them).\n\nThe key lesson from this episode is the one that's been staring us in the face all along: The Republican Party is Trump's party. No one does a better job capturing the resentments and anti-democratic ideologies that have come to fuel internal Republican politics in the last decade ( at least ).\n\nAs long as Trump is on the scene, the Republican Party is his to command. The fall of Ron DeSantis is, more than anything else, a testament to that reality.\n\nUpdate, January 21, 3:30 pm ET: This story was originally published on January 16 and has been updated with news of DeSantis officially quitting the race.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTrailing in by wide margins in the polls, DeSantis may be ever so slowly starting to take on Trump.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign in Iowa Tuesday with a few light digs at former President Donald Trump, who he has so far been reluctant to criticize publicly.\n\nDeSantis is running far behind Trump in the polls - by about 30 percentage points on average - and there are questions as to whether he can run a campaign that feels distinct from MAGA but still has enough general appeal to be successful. That's not an easy task to accomplish without turning off a Republican base that still approves of Trump, but DeSantis seems to be acknowledging that he will have to go on the offensive somewhat. On Tuesday, he did so without ever mentioning Trump by name.\n\nDeSantis contrasted himself with Trump on abortion and Covid-19 policy as he seeks to run to the former president's right on those issues. In his speech at an evangelical church outside of Des Moines, DeSantis touted his signing of a six-week abortion ban in Florida, a measure that some GOP donors worry will doom him in a general election and that Trump has called \"too harsh.\" And he hit back at the former president's recent assertion that New York handled the pandemic better than Florida did.\n\n\"I could count the number of Republicans in this country on my hands that would rather have lived in New York under Cuomo than lived in Florida in our freedom zone,\" DeSantis said in his speech. \"Hell, his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship, are you kidding me?\" he added of Trump, who made his home at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.\n\nDeSantis also indirectly threw shade at Trump's bombastic leadership style, which he contrasted with his own successful efforts to advance conservative priorities in Florida this legislative session. \"At the end of the day, leadership is not about entertainment, it's not about building a brand, it's not about virtue signaling. It is about results,\" DeSantis said.\n\nBut unlike Trump, who is already running a mudslinging campaign against DeSantis , the Florida governor has largely avoided personal attacks on his opponent. That's because DeSantis is walking a tightrope: He has to run to the right of Trump to have a chance at winning the nomination, but can't alienate Trump supporters so much that they oppose him or stay home in a general election. But in running to the right of Trump, he also risks losing Republican moderates or independents in a general election.\n\n\"Anything is possible, but DeSantis doing what he has to do to have any chance of winning the nomination and then surviving the resulting fallout in the general election is highly improbable,\" said Mac Stipanovich, a former Florida Republican consultant who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDeSantis, once a protege of Trump, faces the challenge of consolidating enough support behind him to challenge the former president's historically high polling margin over DeSantis.\n\nThat involves winning over both the faction of the GOP that never thought Trump was fit for office and the majority of Republican voters who are what ex-DeSantis pollster Whit Ayres calls \"Maybe Trump\" voters. DeSantis has to concede that he won't win \"Always Trump\" voters, who represent about a third of the party, Ayres said.\n\n\"The key for anyone challenging Trump will be to consolidate that 'Maybe Trump' faction of the party and maybe pick up a few of the 'Never Trumpers,'\" Ayres said. \"But no candidate is going to be able to penetrate the 'Always Trump' third of the party. They've already decided who they're going to vote for, and they're not interested in anyone else.\"\n\nWhich is why DeSantis may not be able to afford to be overly critical of Trump, and trying to beat the former president at his own game - the name-calling and personal smears, for instance - is probably a losing proposition. \"Everyone who engages Donald Trump in a very personal mud fight ends up losing because he is the all-time champion of the vicious personal attack,\" Ayres said.\n\nBut DeSantis can distinguish himself on policy and his viability as a candidate. Ayres said that DeSantis would also be wise to emphasize the baggage Trump brings. That might not include Trump's indictment in New York, which many Republican voters saw as a politically motivated attack from a Democratic district attorney, giving the former president a bump in the polls. But there may be more criminal charges and legal troubles to come.\n\n\"The key is drawing a contrast with [Trump] on those areas where he is most vulnerable - the amount of baggage that he carries and his potential to lose to Joe Biden or whoever the Democrats come up with in 2024,\" Ayres said.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nRon DeSantis is threatening academic freedom everywhere.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state's Republican-led legislature are fighting a political and ideological war with public colleges and universities.\n\nDeSantis first announced plans to drastically overhaul the state's higher education system in January, floating ideas to defund diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, limit majors like gender studies, remake the small New College of Florida in his conservative vision, expel concepts like critical race theory from the curricula, and limit tenure protections for faculty. Through the bills that DeSantis recently signed this term, SB 266 , HB 931 and SB 240 , a number of these ideas are now law.\n\nAt a recent New College press conference, DeSantis denounced DEI, saying it was best described as \"discrimination, exclusion, and indoctrination.\" He also expressed his wish to have the state turn away from \"niche subjects\" to \"employable majors.\"\n\n\"If you want to do things like gender ideology, go to Berkeley. For us with our tax dollars, we want to be on the classical mission of what a university is supposed to be,\" DeSantis told the audience, alongside Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist and newly appointed New College trustee leading the attack on critical race theory .\n\nA new report from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the organization that established the nation's tenure principles back in 1940, argues the state is leading an \"assault\" that is \"unparalleled in US history.\" And it's not just Florida's students and faculty who stand to be harmed, the organization wrote: \"If sustained, this onslaught threatens the very survival of meaningful higher education in the state, with dire implications for the entire country.\"\n\nAccording to a statement, the DeSantis administration believes these bills will bring the state closer to its goal of being the top state for higher education and the top state for workforce education by 2030.\n\nBut the scope of the legislation will only weaken the system by undermining academic freedom and shared governance, the AAUP argues. The report also found details about how the governor's attempt to change higher education has been going. Since DeSantis started announcing his plans, AAUP learned that administrators throughout the state haven't challenged DeSantis, pushing back neither publicly nor privately. The organization also found that the lawmakers have already produced a chilling effect on academic freedom, with self-censorship and fear \"spilling over\" into the private institutions, as some faculty look outside of Florida for work.\n\nThe heftiest of the three higher education bills is SB 266, which DeSantis signed into law on May 15. It contains broad directives - requiring every state college and university to revise its mission statement and strategic plan - but also some specific ones, limiting the types of courses and majors institutions can offer.\n\nThe bill states that an institution's mission statement and strategic plan must be reviewed and in alignment. Ultimately, the lawmakers want the state's public colleges and universities to develop goals to \"promote the state's economic development\" by attracting tech firms and venture capital to the state. The law prioritizes students who want to solve problems in \"life sciences, water, sustainability, energy, and health care.\"\n\nThe law limits what schools can offer as programs, majors, minors, and curriculum, and what topics can be taught in general education courses, the set of foundational courses students are required to take for a comprehensive liberal arts education.\n\nThe general education courses cannot be based on \"theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political, and economic inequities.\" Relatedly, the law requires schools to provide students with an \"economic security report,\" to inform them of which degrees correspond with the highest and lowest annual earnings.\n\nThe law bans spending related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, beyond what is required by accreditors, stating that funds cannot be used to \"promote, support, or maintain any programs or campus activities\" that \"advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism.\" (Ultimately, this was softened from an earlier version of the bill that sought to ban the spending entirely, due to fears that colleges could lose accreditation.)\n\nThe bill also limits tenure protections for faculty members. Tenure is a lifetime academic appointment granted to professors who meet designated requirements and can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances. Under the law, there must be a post-tenure review of state university faculty every five years to assess accomplishments and productivity, teaching duties, student evaluations, compensation, and potential improvement plans. Faculty members do not have the right to appeal grievances beyond the university president.\n\nUniversity presidents are now responsible for hiring, disciplining, and firing the school provost, deans, and full-time faculty. The law specifically instructs presidents to not be bound by the recommendations or opinions of faculty members when making hiring decisions. As part of their expanded role, presidents must also present yearly performance evaluations and salaries of any personnel earning more than $200,000 to the board of trustees.\n\nTogether, the law strengthens the powers of university leaders and weakens the autonomy of faculty members. The bill threatens academic freedom, according to AAUP, since it limits the teaching of certain topics in the general education curriculum and halts funding for DEI measures, among other limitations. Faculty told the AAUP that the laws are \"Orwellian\" and that Florida is a \"canary in a coal mine.\"\n\nHB931, signed by DeSantis on May 15, requires schools to assess their campus' \"intellectual freedom\" and \"viewpoint diversity\" through an annual survey, to determine whether faculty and students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts on campus and in the classroom. Relatedly, schools cannot require personnel to complete a \"political loyalty test\" or use what Florida Republicans say are political filters during hiring, promotions, and admissions.\n\nThe law forbids \"preferential consideration\" in employment and admissions as a result of someone's partisan beliefs or based on the person's race or ethnicity or support for an ideological movement.\n\nThe lawmakers also say they want to promote greater dialogue across people with opposing viewpoints. HB 931 requires each state university to establish an Office of Public Policy Events to host speakers from \"multiple, divergent, and opposing perspectives\" on public policy.\n\nIn the bill the lawmakers wrote that \"the advancement of knowledge is the fundamental purpose of the state university system and that such advancement is facilitated by the fearless sifting and winnowing of a wide diversity of views and that the open discussion and debate of contested public policy issues from diverse perspectives provides essential preparation for mature citizenship and an informed exercise of the right to vote.\"\n\nThe law gets granular about how schools should run this office, from requiring that the office run at least four debates about \"public policy issues widely discussed\" to whom schools should invite as speakers and where they should post a video recording of the event online.\n\nAlso known as the Reimagining Education And Career Help (REACH) 2.0 Act, SB 240 seeks to expand workforce education programs and increase access to career and technical education programs for high school and college students.\n\nThough the laws don't take effect until July 1, the AAUP's report states that these new laws, coupled with the restrictive education laws that Florida has already passed in the past two years, are already reshaping public higher education \"according to ideological and partisan political standards.\" The report states:\n\nAll of these bills work together to attack higher education on different fronts and serve to (1) threaten academic freedom as it relates to the teaching and research of certain topics, (2) weaken shared governance and workers' rights by concentrating power in the hands of the boards of trustees and presidents, and (3) weaken educators' ability to unionize , thus limiting their ability to fight the abuses of power that are bound to occur after the passage of these bills.\n\nThough courts could overturn some of the new legislation, the report states, the measures have \"already done tremendous damage.\" For example, some faculty members are looking to leave their positions as filling positions with faculty members of color becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nThe president of the United Faculty of Florida told the report's committee that faculty are turning down job offers in Florida without even having other offers. And for those who don't depart, they're self-censoring by changing syllabi and assignments out of caution. One tenured law professor told the committee that the situation is \"Kafkaesque,\" since \"There is literally not a class I teach where I am not somehow violating policies and laws.\"\n\nThe organization is calling on the rest of the country to be vigilant. According to the report, the laws have already served as a model for legislation introduced and in some cases passed, in Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. \"What is happening in Florida will not stay in Florida,\" the report says.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDeSantis's surgeon general is accused of manipulating data to justify an anti-vaccine agenda. How did we get here?\n\nby Dylan Scott\n\nIn March 2020, in the uncertain first weeks of the pandemic, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acted and talked like most other politicians. He shut down public schools and prohibited visitors at nursing homes. He expanded testing capacity and closed parks out of what he called a need to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines on social distancing. By early April, he had issued his own version of a stay-at-home order and was urging his state's residents to stay \"spiritually together, but to remain socially distant.\"\n\nThree years later, DeSantis has transformed himself into the face of an anti-\"woke,\" anti-public health movement that blossomed during the pandemic - the leader of an administration that was willing to not only defy the public health consensus but to control and manipulate information in order to advance its narrative of a crisis that has killed more than 1.1 million Americans, including more than 87,000 Floridians .\n\nA report this month from the Tampa Bay Time revealed that DeSantis's state surgeon general had altered scientific data in order to justify his official position that young men should not receive the Covid-19 vaccine. DeSantis, who has criticized former President Donald Trump for deferring to public health officials like Anthony Fauci, has embraced conspiratorial talking points. He has suggested profits and not public health drove the Covid vaccine campaign and convened a state grand jury to investigate any \"misconduct\" on the part of drug manufacturers and the scientific community related to the vaccines.\n\nWhat the hell happened?\n\nThere is no single, fully satisfactory answer. Even within his own state, DeSantis is viewed as an enigma and his motivations are not well understood, even by those who were hired or consulted by his administration.\n\nWhat's clear is something changed, and quickly. Within a month of pleading with Floridians to remain socially distant, DeSantis had begun to reopen the state's economy. As months went by, he became more brazen in his willingness to bend the truth around Covid and staffed his administration accordingly. Within a year, he had hired a Covid vaccine skeptic as his surgeon general, who would later be accused of altering study data to advance that agenda, and was fighting cruise ships over their plans to impose vaccine mandates for their passengers.\n\n\"When DeSantis started on this, I think he probably had the best interest of Floridians' health at heart,\" Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University, told me. \"By the end, he focused more on forcing measures he hoped would provide an economic recovery.\"\n\nBut with the benefit of hindsight, clues about DeSantis's transformation may reveal themselves. In March and April, the governor's approval ratings sagged . For those who wanted him to be aggressive in fighting Covid-19, he was not doing enough . For the conservative voters beginning to believe an alternative narrative of the pandemic , his response was an overreaction. As he fumbled through the first few weeks of Covid-19, DeSantis seemed to satisfy no one.\n\nSo the governor picked a lane. DeSantis sided with the Republican base upon which he would depend for his political future.\n\nOne public health expert who spoke directly with DeSantis around that time, who, like others I interviewed, did not want to be quoted by name for fear of retribution , said the governor referred specifically to senior residents in conservative areas like the Villages as \"my people\" and appeared preoccupied most with them when considering the response to the coronavirus. Later on, his vaccine-skeptical agenda reflected the mood of many conservative voters, who had glommed onto mischaracterizations about the risks of Covid-19 and conspiracy theories about the vaccines meant to stop it .\n\nDeSantis's pandemic response helped make him into a national figure, valorized among conservatives and villainized by Democrats and many public health experts.\n\nIt is difficult to say with certainty how much any particular government policies affected how a state fared during Covid-19, given that factors beyond anyone's control (such as demographics and infrastructure) played a large role in dictating the course of the pandemic at the local level.\n\nBut the public health experts I spoke to believe DeSantis's approach probably made things worse. His state did see a faster economic recovery than many others, but it came with a cost: Florida ranks 13th among states in deaths per capita. Adjusting deaths for age, the most important driver of fatalities in the pandemic, Florida was at best middle-of-the-road among states in its pandemic performance.\n\nHis evolution is also another window into the kind of political leader Ron DeSantis is. As Vox's Andrew Prokop explained previously, the governor's modus operandi has been to take whatever the dominant conservative issue and position is at a given time and embrace it.\n\nHis pandemic record is the most striking example of DeSantis's chameleon-like political persona. And once he picked a path, he followed it ruthlessly.\n\nRevisiting press reports from March and April 2020, what is most striking is how typical DeSantis's response initially was. Like most political leaders in the United States and around the world, even then-President Trump at times, the governor seemed to recognize the enormity of the challenge ahead.\n\nOn March 12, he discouraged Floridians from hosting and attending large gatherings, and the next day, a 700-person gala to be hosted by Lara Trump at Mar-a-Lago was canceled . A couple of days after that, DeSantis put the state's emergency operations center on its highest level of alert. Schools were closed until at least the end of the month, and the governor issued an order prohibiting most visitors to the state's nursing homes . His administration sought to funnel protective equipment to those facilities with the most vulnerable patients - a move that even his critics still credit DeSantis for, though some facilities were still reporting shortages in the summer of 2020. Indicators suggest Florida's nursing home residents were less likely to die compared to those in most other states, though they still accounted for about one in every three of the state's overall 87,000 pandemic deaths .\n\nHe demonstrated an understanding of how the chain of transmission works and the risks it posed to the most vulnerable people. \"You could acquire this, have no negative impact on you personally, but then can be involved transmitting to someone where it could be serious,\" the governor said during one early press conference.\n\nThe state hired scientists to beef up its emergency response capabilities and initially spent millions on contact tracing and data collection efforts. On March 23, DeSantis closed the state's parks. The Florida environmental agency said the closures were necessary to \"successfully uphold [CDC] guidance to maximize social distancing and avoid gatherings larger than 10 people.\"\n\nDeSantis dragged his feet on issuing a broad stay-at-home order. The Miami Herald upbraided him in a March 22 editorial to \"act like you give a damn.\" The governor had been urging Floridians to voluntarily adhere to social distancing rules. But, after national media reports on spring breakers in the state defying public health guidance, he finally issued a 30-day stay-at-home order on April 1.\n\n\"We want people during this time to be spiritually together, but to remain socially distant,\" DeSantis said on April 6, shortly before the Easter and Passover holidays. \"Please keep God close, but please keep Covid-19 away.\"\n\nThe public health expert who met with DeSantis at this time described his approach to the pandemic as \"conventional.\" DeSantis seemed to want to control the narrative - not unusual for a politician, this person said - but he took the virus seriously, to the point that he did not get physically close to some of the experts present at a private meeting.\n\nThen something changed. When the public health expert met with DeSantis a month later, the governor delivered a 45-minute \"lecture\" to a small group of public health experts about what he thought was going on with the coronavirus: It was only a risk to the elderly, and so restrictions for younger people didn't make sense.\n\nOver the course of the meeting, the governor never asked the experts in the room a single question, this person said.\n\nAround this time, the mood among conservative voters and leaders toward pandemic restrictions was souring and sometimes turning violent . President Trump was urging states to reopen the economy, as he launched a reelection campaign. Southern governors were reportedly making plans in concert to ease those restrictions, an effort that DeSantis was part of.\n\nOn May 1, the state began reopening . Restaurants could resume operations at limited capacity. Hospitals began conducting elective surgeries again. Over the rest of the month, restaurants were allowed to expand their capacity , and other businesses, such as gyms, were permitted to reopen. In early June, theme parks - a major source of tourism in the state - and bars started to reopen, too .\n\nAs his reopening progressed, DeSantis began taking a more combative tone with the media. He portrayed his approach as conservative and data-driven. The state had yet to experience its first major wave of the pandemic, and so, in the governor's view, reopening was warranted.\n\n\"People need to realize that a lot of what was said there has not been proven to be true,\" he said in mid-April.\n\nBut in the months to come, when cases and deaths accelerated, DeSantis largely stayed the course. In fact, he dug in. He was selling a story about Florida as an oasis from public health orthodoxy.\n\nOne data scientist who was contracted by the state told me about a meeting with senior health department officials in June 2020. As this person looked at the data, they thought it was clear that Florida's first major coronavirus wave was building and told the officials as much. But their response was that the uptick in cases was the result of more testing, not a meaningful increase in the real number of infections.\n\nThis scientist said they explained to the senior health officials that the math didn't support that conclusion, that the increase in case numbers was exponentially greater than the recent increases in the state's testing capacity. There was no response to that counterargument from the health department's leaders.\n\n\"I think the scientists I was talking to knew I was right,\" this person said. \"But to say that was to break with the administration.\"\n\nSure enough, coronavirus infections in Florida exploded in June and July, as the daily average of new cases rose from less than 1,000 on June 1 to a peak of nearly 11,900 by the middle of July. About 180 Floridians were dying every day as the calendar turned from July to August.\n\nDeSantis's response to his state's rise in cases and deaths was limited. He resisted calls to require masks in public spaces. He cited younger people as the major drivers of spread, and while he did warn again that younger people could spread the virus to others, he was more fatalistic about the government's ability to influence their behavior.\n\n\"They're going to do what they're going to do,\" he said on June 28.\n\nOver the summer, DeSantis was meeting with some of the academics who authored the controversial Great Barrington Declaration, in which they criticized lockdowns and other interventions while arguing that allowing most people to be exposed to the virus would be the fastest way to build up immunity in the population. DeSantis would embrace this concept of herd immunity in the months to come. He seems to have, in concert with the conservative base's rebellion against public health interventions , lost his faith in their ability to make a difference. The economy would reopen and the virus would do what it would.\n\nThe one thing DeSantis could try to control was the narrative of the pandemic. Some of the allegations made against his administration, such as those by whistleblower Rebekah Jones, have not held up to scrutiny . But DeSantis's personnel decisions and the actions of his subordinates tell the clear story of an administration that would become comfortable with increasingly brazen manipulation of the facts.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, DeSantis's administration hired an Ohio resident and amateur blogger who had gained some notoriety for skeptical takes on Covid-19 to serve as a pandemic data analyst.\n\nThe governor later appointed Harvard-educated Joseph Ladapo to be the state surgeon general that September. Ladapo, the top health official in the state, would become the face of Covid-19 vaccine skepticism in Florida, a cause that DeSantis has embraced with increasing fervor, at the same time his party's base also grew more and more skeptical about the new vaccines that did ultimately prove effective in preventing deaths and hospitalizations .\n\nDeSantis privately received an initial dose but has been coy publicly about whether he received any booster shots. In public, his comments have evolved from an emphasis on individual freedom to casting doubt on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines themselves . The governor eventually asked the state courts to convene a special state grand jury charged with investigating the Covid-19 vaccines, the companies that produced them, and the public health experts who endorsed them.\n\nLadapo has been the megaphone for these anti-vaccine views, including saying healthy children should not receive the vaccines and suggesting that for some, the risk of the vaccines could be greater than the risk of Covid-19. That guidance has been justified in part by manipulated data, according to the recent Tampa Bay Times investigation .\n\nAccording to the Times, an analysis produced by the state showed that the risk of cardiac-related deaths increased for young men after vaccination. Ladapo cited that analysis in his recommendation that young men not get vaccinated. But that final analysis omitted key information that had been present in earlier drafts of the report: The risk of death for young men from a cardiac event was higher after a Covid-19 infection than after vaccination.\n\nLadapo demurred when asked by the Times about the apparent deletion, pointing to DeSantis's request for a grand jury investigation into the pharmaceutical companies that produced the vaccines.\n\n\"As surgeon general, my decisions continue to be led by the raw science - not fear,\" he said in a statement to the newspaper. \"Far less attention has been paid to safety of the Covid-19 vaccines and many concerns have been dismissed - these are important findings that should be communicated to Floridians.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Vox for this story, DeSantis's press office said, \"This topic has been debated in the media for over three years, and the false narratives have been debunked ad nauseam.\"\n\nA Florida health department spokesperson, asked about the Tampa Bay Times report, linked to a study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation that did find a higher incidence of myocarditis in young men after vaccination than after infection. They also cited a Nature study out of the United Kingdom that in the conclusion stated it found \"no evidence of substantially increased mortality risk, either due to cardiac events or overall, from mRNA vaccines\" and that said the methodology used in Florida's own analysis of the vaccines that was the subject of the Tampa Bay Times report had \"introduced bias\" in the results. The Florida health department also pointed to Ladapo's claim this month that the World Health Organization now recommends against giving children the Covid-19 vaccine, a claim debunked by the Associated Press .\n\nThe arc of the DeSantis administration's transformation from relatively anodyne crisis management into the purveyor of misinformation is clearer with hindsight, based on the public record and interviews with experts who were on the ground in Florida. DeSantis came to prioritize the economy over the public health consensus.\n\nAll potential interventions did have limits, and experts are still arguing over the precise impact of different policies. But experts in Florida who saw him and his administration up close believe that DeSantis's approach came at a cost to protecting people's health. The empirical evidence would suggest that his state did have a mediocre performance at best on the most important metric of the pandemic: saving lives.\n\nTo the experts frustrated by the governor's actions over the past three years, the specter of politics looms large.\n\n\"When the base is moving in that direction, then it's logical - but not driven by science or public health - to do what was important and best for his people,\" the expert who met with DeSantis told me.\n\nAs time went on, this person thought DeSantis's approach became: \"Dazzle them with bullshit.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Ron DeSantis approaches the end of his second term in office, he's talking up one potential heir to succeed him in 2026: his wife, Casey DeSantis . And he's taking a shot at President Donald Trump 's pick to be the next governor.\n\nQuestioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy , and argued that the state's first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin.\n\n\"She's somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,\" DeSantis said of his wife. \"Anything we've accomplished, she'd be able to take to the next level.\"\n\nThe comments came days after the president threw his support behind U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds , a Florida Republican who has been a prominent surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and cable news.\n\n\"We've achieved victories in Florida,\" DeSantis said Monday. \"A guy like Byron, he just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left over these last years.\"\n\nDeSantis' comments create a potential faceoff between the Republican governor and the president who soundly defeated him last year for the Republican presidential nomination. DeSantis, who is term-limited, may run for president again in 2028 and has worked to rebuild his relationship with Trump.\n\nThe aspirations of the state's first lady have long been the subject of Tallahassee parlor talk. That chatter has grown louder in recent weeks as tensions have bubbled between the governor and Trump's allies in the Florida Legislature.\n\n\"Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement,\" Trump wrote last Thursday on social media. \"RUN, BYRON, RUN!\"\n\nDonalds' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference last week after Trump's post and told the audience to \"stay tuned\" about his future plans.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, another staunch Trump ally, criticized DeSantis' comments in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Man it hurts me to see this,\" Gaetz said. \"Governor DeSantis, don't you remember when you, (Donalds) and I were working collaboratively to get you elected in 2018? We literally were your debate prep team.\"\n\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Ron DeSantis said Thursday his office has tools, including suspending officials from office, to compel local governments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in assisting in detentions and deportations.\n\nThe governor's remarks came just two days after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier warned city officials in Fort Myers that their failure to approve an immigration agreement with federal authorities could have serious consequences.\n\nThe Fort Myers City Council on Monday failed to approve an agreement that would have allowed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to train local law officers to interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation.\n\nSeveral council members expressed concern that it would lead to racial profiling and harm the community.\n\nOn Tuesday, Uthmeier sent a letter to the city saying Fort Myers could be violating state law prohibiting \"sanctuary cities,\" a name often given to municipalities that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.\n\n\"Sanctuary policies are not tolerated or lawful in Florida,\" Uthmeier wrote. \"Immediate corrective action is required.\"\n\nDeSantis has a history of removing local officials with whom he has disagreed, in moves critics say are politically motivated. Earlier this decade, the GOP governor removed Monique Worrell, the Democratic state prosecutor for the Orlando area, saying she had failed to prosecute crimes committed by minors and didn't seek mandatory minimum sentences for gun crime.\n\nWorrell, who disputed that claim, was voted back into office last year.\n\nLast month, DeSantis announced that several Florida law enforcement agencies had struck an agreement with ICE to interrogate, arrest and detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and deliver them to federal authorities.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Jim DeFede analysis: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis backs down on immigration\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 11, 2025 / 6:56 PM EST / CBS Miami\n\nMIAMI - As this year's third Florida special legislative session on immigration gets underway this week in Tallahassee, there is one unmistakable conclusion: Gov. Ron DeSantis lost.\n\nThe man whose failed presidential campaign was based on the slogan: Never Back Down , did indeed back down.\n\nFor weeks, DeSantis publicly attacked House Speaker Danny Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton, accusing them of being soft on immigration because they refused to support his proposal and instead passed their own immigration bill .\n\nDeSantis held multiple press conferences across the state attacking Perez and Albritton (but especially Perez). He unleashed his taxpayer-funded staff and his army of social media trolls to eviscerate Perez, calling him a RINO, a traitor, and much worse.\n\nDeSantis went on Fox News and other right-wing outlets to try and bully the Legislature into submission.\n\nDeSantis used his control of the Republican Party of Florida to send out mass texts to Republican voters, telling them their local legislators were betraying them because they didn't vote for the governor's bill.\n\nAny legislator who defied him was warned they could expect DeSantis to mount campaigns against them when they were up for re-election.\n\nThe personal cell phone numbers of legislators were blasted out via text, prompting death threats against lawmakers and their families.\n\nIt was an ugly campaign of intimidation by the governor and his cronies. And it was never really about immigration. It was about power.\n\nAnd it failed.\n\nDeSantis huffed and he puffed, but he couldn't blow the House or the Senate down.\n\nAs DeSantis bellowed and blustered against lawmakers, he kept waiting for Donald Trump to publicly back him and force the Legislature to cave. Trump, however, stayed silent. He wasn't going to ride in and save DeSantis.\n\nSo instead, DeSantis did something he never does - he surrendered. He met with Perez and Albritton and produced a new bill.\n\nBut in this new bill, DeSantis will not get his own personal immigration czar.\n\nHe will not get $350 million to run his own deportation program so he can snatch undocumented migrants off the street and fly them \"on the spot,\" as he bragged, to a third country.\n\nHe will not get a new law blocking undocumented migrants from sending money to their families in their home country.\n\nAnd after insulting the state's elected agriculture commissioner, Wilton Simpson, as running a \"lower-level cabinet agency\" who could not be trusted to enforce state law - \"the fox guarding the hen house,\" is how the governor described Simpson - DeSantis is being forced to accept Simpson as an equal partner in a new State Immigration Enforcement Council.\n\nDig deeper into the new bill introduced this week and you will see that on numerous other issues, DeSantis has been forced to accept changes to his proposal. To be fair, the Legislature also modified its original proposal, giving DeSantis some of the things he wanted.\n\nUnder normal circumstances this would be known as compromise-which used to be considered a good thing in politics. DeSantis, however, has always viewed that word as tantamount to weakness.\n\nFor the past six years, DeSantis has treated the Legislature with contempt and for most of that time, the Legislature has allowed him to get away with whatever he wanted. Some legislators did so because they supported his ideas and ambitions, but many did so out of fear.\n\nThat ended this week.\n\nSo, to put it in terms DeSantis understands, the unmistakable conclusion is DeSantis lost.\n\nPerez and Albritton won.\n\n\"We asserted our right as the elected representatives of the people to have an equal seat at the table,\" Perez said Tuesday afternoon as he opened the latest special session. \"To be a participant in a conversation rather than a recipient of instructions.\"\n\nThe specifics of the latest immigration bill are secondary to the larger issue of returning balance between the governor and the legislature.\n\nDeSantis is now praising Albritton and Perez saying they \"have been great partners and we have produced an aggressive bill that we can stand fully behind.\" DeSantis even thanked Simpson \"for his support.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Perez praised DeSantis but then added: \"Governor, we've gotten to know each other better in the last three weeks than in the last six years. I'm looking forward to the next two.\"\n\nIn other words, welcome to the lame duck era of Ron DeSantis.\n\nJim DeFede joined CBS4 News in January 2006 and serves as an investigative reporter for the station, as well as host of its Sunday morning public affairs program \"Facing South Florida.\"\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "DeSantis clashes with Florida Republicans in bid to align closer with Trump\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 5, 2025 / 9:28 AM EST / AP\n\nWith an open presidential primary coming in 2028, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is launching an offensive to win back supporters of the Republican leader whom he dared to challenge in the last election. And he's doing so by latching onto President Donald Trump 's most prominent issue - immigration.\n\nThe problem for DeSantis is his own state's Republicans think they know Trump better.\n\nDeSantis last week ordered lawmakers into a special legislative session to pass a raft of border-related proposals he floated, including criminal charges for officers if they didn't enforce immigration measures and restrictions on people who send money to families outside the U.S.\n\nWithin minutes of the session convening, legislators tossed out the governor's proposals and called their own special session . They ignored many of his requests and presented their own bill that cedes much of DeSantis' power on immigration enforcement to the state's agriculture commissioner. Lawmakers titled it the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP, Act.\n\nThe battle has exposed the term-limited governor's struggles to regain the power he lost in his first White House run as he prepares for a potential second try.\n\nHaving led Florida's transformation from a perennial swing state to one that votes solidly Republican, DeSantis is betting on his feel for his state's voters, who delivered a second term by a huge 19-point margin. But he has struggled to capture the unstoppable aura he had before he went against Trump - and his relative lack of relationships with lawmakers hasn't helped.\n\n\"This is a relationship business,\" Republican political consultant Jamie Miller said. \"And he is not good at the relationship side.\"\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBack in 2023, when DeSantis braved the frigid Iowa winter to run for president - and brought some loyal legislators to campaign for him - he sold himself to voters as a brash, bold executive, a more effective version of Trump. And he could point to the results, thanks to the Florida legislature.\n\nFor six years, DeSantis kept lawmakers in line with his veto pen. But as DeSantis' chances faded on his way to a blowout loss in the Iowa caucuses, the presidential sheen wore off.\n\nIn a sign DeSantis was not proving a threat to Trump, the Republican Party of Florida voted in September 2023 not to require participants in the state's 2024 presidential primary to pledge to support the eventual nominee, which ensured Trump would not have to pledge support to DeSantis when the two were locked in a bitter campaign.\n\nDeSantis would never gain the national traction his campaign had set out to demonstrate, and would be out of the race within a week of the leadoff Iowa caucuses. Despite a year of Trump's taunts, they reached a public rapprochement last May, when DeSantis agreed to convene his top donors to raise money for Trump.\n\n\"Ron, I love that you're back,\" Trump said during a conference call to the donors as they gathered at a Fort Lauderdale hotel, raising $3 million in a day for Trump's campaign.\n\nBy December, DeSantis had worked his way into the discussion for Trump's defense secretary when Pete Hegseth encountered public resistance. Hegseth was ultimately confirmed.\n\nDeSantis has never been comfortable with the backslapping and favor-trading side of politics, which some of his most influential supporters say may rub some lawmakers the wrong way. Even among his admirers, DeSantis is known for having little patience for greasing the wheels of government - shaking hands and making phone calls. Trump, meanwhile, is well-known for his personal touch, often calling lawmakers for their input and inviting current and would-be allies to his Mar-a-Lago estate or his other properties.\n\nAnd now the governor's attitude is costing him, some capitol watchers say.\n\nLast month, when DeSantis announced he was calling lawmakers into special session, House Speaker Daniel Perez told The Associated Press the legislature was \"blindsided.\"\n\n\"I called him immediately,\" Perez said. \"He didn't answer. He didn't call me back.\"\n\nState Sen. Randy Fine is a former ally of the governor who later endorsed Trump in the 2024 primary. The president returned the favor after his victory by endorsing Fine in a Republican primary for the U.S. House seat previously held by Mike Waltz, who was picked to be national security adviser. Last week, Fine won the contest with more than 80% of the vote and is on track to win the seat in April, despite not living in the district he hopes to represent.\n\nFine compared his reward to the treatment of lawmakers who were loyal to DeSantis - and are now being attacked as \"Republicans in name only.\"\n\n\"I was loyal. I'm going to Congress. They were loyal. They get called RINOs who want amnesty,\" Fine said. \"There are female members of the Legislature who went to Iowa a year ago and walked through the snow to help him and got frostbite. And now a year later they're RINOs who want amnesty? I think it's hard to describe the sense of betrayal.\"\n\nBoth sides of the argument over Florida's immigration battle say they are best capturing Trump's desires.\n\nThe governor said the legislature's measure is a \"betrayal\" of conservative voters and naming it after the president is a \"misnomer.\"\n\n\"President Trump has been very strong coming out of the gate on immigration enforcement. He wants to solve this problem once and for all. The bill they did is more window dressing,\" DeSantis said in a video he posted on X. Transferring his power to the agriculture commissioner, he said, would be like putting the \"fox in charge of the hen house,\" implying farmers want to continue to hire immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nBut legislators say they have Trump's blessing. The bill sponsor, the Florida House speaker and the state senator expected to be sent to Congress visited the White House on Monday to celebrate NHL's defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers.\n\n\"The whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\" said Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, a bill sponsor and Trump ally. He said Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president and immigration hard-liner, gave lawmakers \"technical guidance\" and they made changes to the bill \"to make sure we're doing everything that the president's team wants.\"\n\nDeSantis has picked up some support along the way. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a key Trump ally who might run to replace the term-limited DeSantis next year, said his own relationship with the governor \"got frayed\" when Donalds backed Trump two years ago.

DeSantis' State of the State address\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 4, 2025 / 3:37 PM EST / CBS/News Service of Florida\n\nWhile saying Florida has been a leader on issues such as cracking down on illegal immigration, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday helped launch the 2025 legislative session by calling for revamping the ballot-initiative process, curbing property taxes and revisiting gun laws.\n\nDeSantis largely stuck to broad ideas rather than detailed plans during his annual State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature in the House chamber.\n\nThe 60-day session will include myriad issues, including the House and Senate negotiating a budget that likely will exceed $115 billion.\n\nAfter spearheading efforts to defeat proposed constitutional amendments in November about recreational marijuana and abortion rights, DeSantis reiterated his position that lawmakers should take steps to prevent what he contends is fraud in the petition-gathering process for initiatives.\n\nDeSantis and other Republicans recently have floated the idea of eliminating or reducing local government property taxes . While the governor did not provide a detailed proposal Tuesday, he again expressed support for the issue.\n\nDeSantis also signaled that he would support revising state gun laws, including a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns and what is known as a \"red flag\" law that allows authorities to remove guns if people are found to pose a \"significant danger\" to themselves or others.\n\nWhile DeSantis used the 31-minute address to outline legislative priorities, he also touted the state's record on issues such as illegal immigration enforcement . During a special session last month, lawmakers passed a wide-ranging law aimed at helping carry out President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nSen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, criticized DeSantis' speech Tuesday.\n\n\"The governor should read the temperature of the room,\" Jones said. \"He doesn't have as many fans as he used to have, back in the day.\"\n\nThe CBS Miami team is a group of experienced journalists who bring you the content on CBSMiami.com.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "DeSantis to launch presidential campaign May 24, sources say\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  May 18, 2023 / 8:01 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to formally announce in a \"virtual\" way on May 24 that he is running for president, as donors and fundraisers gather in Miami to make calls and fundraise for his campaign, according to three sources familiar with the planning.\n\nHe plans to file papers with the Federal Election Commission to officially establish his presidential candidacy. The Miami gathering, which includes some of the governor's most generous longtime donors, are expected to receive briefings on campaign strategy and requests to help raise significant sums of cash for his bid, three people familiar with the plans said.\n\nA more formal kickoff event is expected to be held closer to June 1, according to those familiar with his plans. It is likely to occur in DeSantis's hometown of Dunedin, Fla., sources familiar with the plans said.\n\nA DeSantis spokesman declined to comment on the timing for an announcement. The news on a launch next week was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .\n\nA senior official with DeSantis' political operation said the staffers have been fielding \"unprecedented interest and support for his candidacy,\" and claimed they could potentially have the \"biggest bundler operation in Republican presidential primary history.\" A bundler is a fundraiser who solicits donations on behalf of a campaign.\n\nThe official also highlighted DeSantis' state legislative endorsements from Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida, and the strength of the political operation, touting that last weekend in Iowa, the DeSantis team \"made a call to reroute to Des Moines with 90 minutes notice and produced a crowd of almost 200 people.\" The official added that the same task would take the Nikki Haley campaign, Senator Tim Scott's expected campaign and others \"many days, if not weeks, to assemble.\"\n\nOn Monday, his political operation moved out of the state GOP headquarters to a new office in Tallahassee , a move that cost more than $5,000, and triggered a federal campaign law requiring DeSantis to register as a candidate and designate a principal campaign committee within 15 days.\n\nAsked in Sarasota, Fla., Monday if he'd announce a run within the next 15 days, DeSantis noted he had \"a couple more things left on the [legislative] agenda,\" including the state budget.\n\nDeSantis' entry in the 2024 presidential race comes after months of visits to early presidential primary states and across the country to promote his new book and tout his legislative record as governor. DeSantis was in Iowa for multiple events this past weekend.\n\nHe is currently serving his second term as Florida governor after he was reelected by a nearly 20-point margin in November 2022. In the state's latest legislative term , which ended in May, DeSantis signed a succession of bills popular with conservatives, including a six-week abortion ban and one that established permitless concealed firearm carry. On the road, he's also been  highlighting bipartisan bills that would increase teacher pay, lower prescription drug prices and cut taxes for home goods.\n\nHe cruised through the GOP primary for governor in 2018 after he was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and won the general election by 32,463 votes.\n\nDeSantis served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2012 to 2018 and was a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. After graduating from Yale and then Harvard Law, DeSantis served in the Navy as a JAG officer and was deployed to Iraq.\n\nHis prominence in the Republican party rose with his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when he lifted lockdowns on businesses and in-person schooling sooner than other states. His \"Parental Rights in Education\" bill, which prohibits instruction about sexual orientation and gender studies up to the 3rd grade has also resulted in a high-profile fight with the Disney Corporation after its former CEO voiced his opposition to the legislation. That prohibition has since been extended to the 8th grade and under.\n\nDeSantis has proven to be a prolific fundraiser - his state political committee, \"Friends of Ron DeSantis,\" has received $225.8 million in donations since launching in January 2018. He has also raised more than $4.3 million for Republican organizations in 10 different speaking engagements since March, according to his political team.\n\nA super PAC supporting DeSantis, \"Never Back Down,\" launched earlier this year and has already raised over $30 million.\n\nThe \"Friends of Ron DeSantis\" state committee has more than $85.7 million cash on hand that may be transferred to a PAC, but not directly to DeSantis' campaign. The governor officially disassociated himself from that committee earlier in May.\n\nSo far, he has consistently placed second to Trump in early 2024 presidential polls, but has maintained a double-digit lead over other potential Republican challengers. Trump announced his third bid for the presidency in November 2022.\n\nA CBS News poll from late April showed 58% of likely Republican voters would support Trump in a primary, while 22% picked DeSantis. Former Vice President Mike Pence and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy tied for a distant third, with 5% a piece.\n\nIn recent months, top GOP donors have been reluctant to publicly support a DeSantis bid, spooked because of the six-week abortion ban he signed in Florida and his characterization of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a \"territorial dispute.\" Congressional Republicans also criticized his Ukraine comment, which he has since said was \"mischaracterized,\" and added criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he called a \"war criminal.\"\n\nTrump has consistently targeted DeSantis at campaign events and on social media, and his PAC, \"MAGA Inc.\", has run ads slamming him for votes he took as a congressman on Social Security and Medicare reform.\n\nDeSantis has declined to confront Trump by name, but after an interview with The Messenger , in which Trump criticized Florida's six-week abortion ban and said \"many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh,\" DeSantis offered one of his more direct responses.\n\n\"And I think that as a Florida resident, you know, he didn't give an answer about, 'Would you have signed the heartbeat bill that Florida did?'\" he said Tuesday. \"I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He will not answer whether he would sign it or not.\"\n\nDeSantis has also often talked about how the Republican party has to shake its \"culture of losing\" in recent elections, including in 2020 when Trump lost to President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I didn't see a red wave across this country [in 2022] and so I think the party has developed a culture of losing. I think that there's not accountability. And I think in Florida, we really show what it takes to not just win, [but] win big and then deliver big,\" he said Monday.\n\nAaron Navarro is a CBS News digital reporter covering the 2024 elections.

      "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was once seen as the biggest threat to Trump's 2024 White House bid, ends his presidential campaign\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday suspended his presidential campaign, a stunning fall for the conservative leader who had long been seen as the biggest threat to former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\n\"I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,\" DeSantis said in a message to supporters . \"It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.\"\n\n\"While this campaign has ended, the mission continues,\" he continued. \"Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead.\"\n\nDeSantis, who entered the presidential race last May, sought to build on the national profile that he had built for himself as an immigration hard-liner and as a politician who had fought against COVID-19 mandates. After winning reelection in November 2022 in a 19-point landslide, DeSantis' profile exploded, and he was immediately viewed by many Republicans as the conservative who could go toe-to-toe against Trump and capture the GOP nomination.\n\nIn several polls taken before DeSantis entered the race, the governor actually polled ahead of Trump , which at the time revealed the vulnerable state that the former president found himself in politically after Republicans faltered in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAfter DeSantis entered the race, he was competitive in the early-voting states, but as the summer and fall went on, his numbers slipped precipitously across the country. He staked his campaign on winning the Iowa caucuses , but Trump's standing in the state only strengthened by the end of last year.\n\nTrump's myriad legal issues seemingly had the effect of boosting his polling numbers with GOP primary voters, which in turn iced out DeSantis as the leading alternative to the former president.\n\nTrump would go on to win the Iowa caucuses , taking 51% of the vote to DeSantis' 21% share and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley's 19%. Despite campaigning in all 99 of Iowa's counties, DeSantis did not win a single county in the state.\n\nDeSantis' exit from the race also comes two days before the New Hampshire primary, a contest where he was struggling for relevancy, with most his polling numbers mired in the single digits.\n\nThe governor in recent days had sought to pivot to the South Carolina Republican primary on Feb. 24, but with Trump riding high there and Haley have a sizable level of support in her home state, his pathway to continuing in the race became incredibly murky.\n\nJump to"

Ron DeSantis has opted to take a different route: He's maintained his public profile by signing bill after bill focused on security.\n\nIn his video announcing the end of his campaign, DeSantis foreshadowed his future goals during the remainder of his tenure as Florida's leader, which, barring a debacle, should last until January 2027.\n\n\"While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"We will continue to show the country how to lead.\"\n\nIn the two months since he's returned to Florida full-time, DeSantis has been busy, signing several bills and orders, each marked with a common theme: safety and security.\n\nOn March 13, the governor sent 250 State and National Guard officers to the southern coastline to help \"combat illegal vessels coming to Florida from countries such as Haiti.\" The state's announcement alluded to migrants invading Florida.\n\n\"When a state faces the possibility of invasion, it has the right and duty to defend its territory and people,\" the press release said. \"Under Governor Ron DeSantis, Florida will act.\"\n\nOn March 21, DeSantis enacted a law barring homeless Floridians from sleeping on public property to \"ensure that Florida streets are clean and that Florida streets are safe for our residents,\" a move some advocates have compared to \"criminalizing homelessness.\"\n\nDays later, the governor signed a bill prohibiting children in Florida under 14 years old from using Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram, which he said he did to stop pedophiles from messaging kids. It also allows parents to sue the social media platforms for $10,000 if they don't remove their child's flagged account quickly enough.\n\n\"You can have a kid in the house, safe, seemingly, and then you have predators that can get right in there into your own home,\" he warned at a press conference. \"You can do everything right, and they know how to manipulate these platforms.\"\n\nUnrelated to safety and security, DeSantis signed a bill allowing wine to be sold in glass bottles in sizes up to 15 liters.\n\nThe Republican-led Florida Legislature has passed several bills this year as well - which DeSantis could sign at any time - such as raising the legal age of becoming a stripper or restricting when drivers can use the left-most late.\n\nDisney World and the state of Florida also, notably, reached an agreement Wednesday to end their yearlong battle over the theme park's special tax district that began after Disney executives spoke out against the states' unofficially named \"Don't Say Gay\" law.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "DeSantis spent $1,497 per vote in Iowa just to get utterly crushed by Trump\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis spent nearly $1,500 per vote in Iowa only to see his dreams of winning the Hawkeye State disintegrate with former President Donald Trump's blowout victory in the state's GOP caucuses on Monday.\n\nAccording to data from AdImpact, DeSantis and his allied super PACs spent approximately $35.06 million in Iowa through January 15 and received roughly 23,000 votes during the caucuses. The result was DeSantis spending $1,497 per vote in Iowa. (The DeSantis campaign spent $3,021,449, while affiliated PACs spent $32,037,828, per AdImpact.)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his allies spent nearly $18.5 million on advertising in Iowa through January 15, by far the lowest of the three leading operations, according to AdImpact. The former president received over 56,000 votes in the caucuses, meaning that Trump spent roughly $328 per vote in the state, a much leaner figure than DeSantis. (The Trump campaign spent $7,018,016, while affiliated PACs spent $11,454,607, per AdImpact.)\n\nFormer UN ambassador Nikki Haley and her broader operation spent roughly $37 million through that same period. She earned over 21,000 votes, coming in third place in the caucuses, having spent approximately $1,760 per vote. (Haley's campaign spent nearly $5 million on ads while affiliated PACs spent 32,144,446, per AdImpact.)\n\nDeSantis' spending is likely far more than other competitors if direct spending in Iowa is considered and not merely ad spend. Business Insider didn't include this in our analysis, but few campaigns devoted more attention to Iowa than the Florida governor . He made it a point to highlight that he visited each of Iowa's 99 counties. Despite his lengthy slog, DeSantis is not currently projected to have won a single county in the state.\n\nIt's important to look at both direct campaign spending and super PAC support, especially since some candidates like DeSantis relied overwhelmingly on their outside operations.\n\nSuper PACs are not supposed to directly coordinate with a candidate's presidential campaign, but in practice that restriction is far from a firewall. For example, DeSantis essentially farmed out most of his Iowa operation to Never Back Down, an allied super PAC, which featured him as a guest on campaign stops throughout Iowa.\n\nThe former president's spending further illustrated how he has completely upended the traditional playbook to win Iowa. Unlike DeSantis, Trump held relatively few events in the state. Still, Trump's on track to have won by the largest margin ever in a competitive Iowa Republican caucus, having won an outright 51% majority, compared to DeSantis' 21% share and Haley's 19% share.\n\nBy all accounts, Trump's campaign built an impressive operation in Iowa, as they cultivated support among GOP officials and grassroots organizations early on and seemingly expanded on that support. If the former president's greater operation can continue his current spending pace, his allies should be able to enter a likely general election rematch in a relatively strong position.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign entered the year with $117 million on hand . The president's main allied super PAC, Future Forward, doesn't have to file updated numbers until the end of the month.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is kissing the Trump ring again, saying the US needs a strong commander, not 4 more years of a 'Weekend at Bernie's' presidency\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has joined the chorus of conservatives backing former President Donald Trump and slamming President Joe Biden ahead of the November elections.\n\nSpeaking on the second day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, he said: \"Our enemies do not confine their designs to between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., we need a commander in chief who can lead 24 hours a day and seven days a week.\"\n\nThis point from DeSantis appeared to reference Biden saying - after his disastrous CNN debate versus Trump - that he just needs more rest and should stop holding events after 8 p.m.\n\n\"America cannot afford four more years of a 'Weekend at Bernie's' presidency,\" DeSantis said, drawing loud cheers from the audience and making Trump crack a smile.\n\n\"Weekend at Bernie's\" is a 1989 dark comedy about two insurance employees who try to conceal that their boss, Bernie, is dead while on a weekend retreat at his beach house in the Hamptons.\n\nThis joke from DeSantis was a clear jab at Biden's health and fitness. There have been concerns, however - from Democratic lawmakers and donors alike - that Biden, who has had more than his fair share of gaffes in recent weeks, may not be the party's best pick for 2024.\n\nBut Biden is hanging in there despite at least 18 House Democrats and one Democratic senator calling on him to step aside. Biden has also said he only plans to quit if he gets \"hit by a train.\"\n\nWhile DeSantis is now voicing full-throated support for Trump, the two share a complicated history.\n\nHe started out as Trump's protege and clinched a win for Florida governor in 2018 with Trump's endorsement . Trump has credited himself with DeSantis' win .\n\nBut their relationship soured after DeSantis embarked on a 2024 presidential run, posing a challenge to Trump.\n\nTrump told reporters in November 2022: \"I don't think it's nice.\"\n\n\"I'm a very loyal person. So, I don't understand disloyalty. I really don't. But you see it. You do see disloyalty in politics,\" he said.\n\nTrump also gave DeSantis several nicknames , including \"Ron DeSanctimonious .\"\n\nDeSantis quit the race in January after losing key support in early-voting states.\n\nThe two men may since have buried the hatchet. The Washington Post reported in April that they met in Florida at Miami's Shell Bay Clu, where Trump sought DeSantis' help with his presidential campaign fundraising. DeSantis said he was open to it, per The Post.\n\nRepresentatives for DeSantis, Trump and Biden did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Where does DeSantis go from here?\n\nThe first contest in the fight for the 2024 presidential Republican nomination has officially come to a close in Iowa, with former President Donald Trump dominating the field. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida finished in a distant second place, leaving his path to the nomination unclear.\n\nBy night's end on Monday, DeSantis tallied just 21% of the vote in Iowa, which amounted to eight of the state's 40 delegates. Former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina finished in third place with 19% of the vote. Both fell far short of Trump's 51%.\n\nTrump committed limited resources to his win. Haley essentially tied DeSantis despite a strategy far more suited to New Hampshire and South Carolina. DeSantis, however, made Iowa a centerpiece of his effort .\n\nThough the estimated margin of victory had shifted in recent weeks, Trump had long been the clear favorite to win the state.\n\nEyes in Iowa had long been on which candidate would place second: DeSantis, once considered a formidable competitor to Trump, or Haley, Trump's former UN ambassador who's repeatedly declined to say whether she'd accept an offer to be his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nNevertheless, despite running a nearly textbook-perfect campaign for the Iowa caucuses and visiting each of the state's 99 counties, DeSantis won zero of them .\n\nAfter DeSantis' poor showing in Iowa, the Florida governor faces an important question: Where exactly are the 1,215 delegates he needs to win the nomination going to come from? If he couldn't win even one-quarter of the available delegates in Iowa, where he campaigned for months, how would he start winning majorities elsewhere?\n\nNew Hampshire is the first GOP primary, taking place on January 23. As of the most recent poll of the state from Emerson College , Haley was 21 percentage points ahead of DeSantis, who finished in the poll behind even former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who's no longer a candidate .\n\nDeSantis' campaign said it's traveling straight to South Carolina - Haley's home state - post-Iowa to get a head start on the fifth primary before returning to New Hampshire to participate in a televised town hall.\n\nBut with DeSantis' dismal finish on Monday, what's increasingly looking like a third-place finish in New Hampshire, and no obvious advantage in South Carolina against one of the state's former governors and a popular former president, momentum is not on his side.\n\nIt may be best for DeSantis to hang up his raised boots for the campaign season and focus on finishing his final few years in the governor's mansion.\n\nJump to"

Matt Gaetz 's bid for attorney general may have been short-lived, but he appears to have his sights set on another big career move.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Florida State Rep. Anthony Sabatini posted on X his prediction that Gaetz would be the next governor of Florida. Gaetz responded to Sabatini with a gif of the Florida state flag.\n\nGaetz resigned from Congress in November after President-elect Donald Trump had tapped him for attorney general.\n\nBut that bid soon soured when Gaetz became embroiled in fresh scandal, including new developments in a long-running sex-trafficking investigation against him. The DOJ declined to pursue charges against Gaetz in 2023, but the House Ethics Committee continued probing the allegations.\n\nCNN reported on Thursday that Gaetz withdrew from consideration shortly after they contacted him for comment regarding an accusation that he had a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017.\n\nGaetz has denied wrongdoing in the sex-trafficking probe and the encounter. However, he withdrew himself from consideration for the attorney general post on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,\" Gaetz wrote on X on Thursday.\n\nAfter Gaetz withdrew, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he appreciated Gaetz's \"efforts.\"\n\n\"He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!\" Trump added.\n\nMeanwhile in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis terms out in 2026. DeSantis, once a Trump protége, got on his former boss's bad side when he started running a short-lived, Elon-Musk-backed presidential race against Trump.\n\nFlorida has had a continuous slate of Republican governors since Jeb Bush won his gubernatorial race in 1998.\n\nIt's unclear what Gaetz's chances will look like in 2026 if he were to run for governor. But Gaetz is now in the market for a new gig - he said last week that he doesn't intend to rejoin the 119th Congress, to which he was elected in November to represent Florida's 1st congressional district.\n\n\"I'm still going to be in the fight, but it's going to be from a new perch,\" Gaetz told conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk last week.\n\n\"It seems like a pretty poetic time to allow that great new blood to come in, to allow my district to have high-quality representation,\" Gaetz said, adding that he's not going off on a \"tropical excursion\" for the rest of his life.\n\nFor now, he seems to be enjoying some downtime - fishing, spending time with his wife, Ginger, and making some bucks filming videos on Cameo like his former colleague, George Santos .\n\nGaetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nJump to"

Ron DeSantis\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign against ideas he considers \"woke\" has  run into some roadblocks.\n\nA court settlement this week blunted his Parental Rights in Education Act, a law that critics call Don't Say Gay. And earlier this month, a federal court blocked another key measure that DeSantis introduced in 2021 and called the Stop WOKE Act. It marked the beginning of DeSantis' efforts to reshape how Floridians view and teach issues involving race and gender identity.\n\nThe Stop WOKE Act banned instruction in schools or mandatory training in workplaces that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed because of their race, sex or national origin. Other bills and regulations soon followed, targeting programs to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. For decades, DEI programs as they're known have worked to promote fair treatment of underrepresented groups.\n\nDeSantis believes DEI programs that focus on issues such as race and sexual orientation are unconstitutional and discriminatory. \"They call it equity,\" he said when introducing the Stop WOKE Act. \"Just understand, when you hear equity used, that is just an ability for people to smuggle in their ideology.\"\n\nPolitically, the Stop WOKE Act, which was later renamed the Individual Freedom Act was a winner for DeSantis. It helped mobilize conservatives in Florida, helping him win reelection in 2022 by a wide margin. Legally though, it ran into problems.\n\nA federal judge said by restricting people's speech, the law was \"positively dystopian.\" Last year, an appeals court ruled it couldn't apply to colleges and universities. That same court recently ruled it couldn't be enforced against businesses, either. \"The court resoundingly rejected the STOP Woke Act as applied to employers and said it was in plain violation of the First Amendment,\" says attorney Shalini Goel Agarwal of Protect Democracy, who represented the businesses that filed the lawsuit.\n\nDeSantis' administration says it disagrees with the decision and is considering an appeal. But Agarwal notes that four federal judges, including two appointed by former President Donald Trump, have now blocked the law. \"I would hope that resounding rejection will have some weight with the state in them thinking about whether they want to pursue it further,\" she says.\n\nOther courts also have ruled against a number of DeSantis' conservative initiatives. A federal judge temporarily blocked a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Another judge put a law on hold that would punish businesses that allow children into drag shows. Courts have struck down congressional maps and voter registration restrictions championed by DeSantis.\n\nBut he's also had victories. Judges have upheld the Parental Rights in Education Act. Gay rights groups say this week's settlement with the state will make sure the law won't be used to discriminate against LGBTQ families.\n\nPeople protested in March 2022, after the passage of Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, also dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by LGBTQ activists. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPeople protested in March 2022, after the passage of Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, also dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by LGBTQ activists.\n\nThe impact of DeSantis' campaign might be greatest on Florida colleges and universities. Backed by Republican lawmakers, he's banned all DEI programs from state schools.\n\nDeSantis told a conservative group recently that he wants to stop the \"indoctrination\" of students at colleges and universities. \"DEI is really insidious,\" he said. \"First of all, it's very divisive because it tries to divvy people up based on superficial characteristics. But it also serves to supplant merit in favor of this agenda.\"\n\nThe University of Florida recently eliminated all of its full-time DEI positions, the latest school to comply with the new regulations. The university's faculty union condemned the move, saying it ignores Florida's history of discrimination. Union President Meera Sitharam, who is also a professor of computer science, says DeSantis has signed laws weakening faculty tenure and has put pressure on schools to promote conservative viewpoints. His administration recently removed sociology as a core course at state schools.\n\nShe calls it an attack on academic freedom. \"They see faculty as the people who are responsible for the quote-unquote indoctrination of the next generation,\" Sitharam says. \"But really, the target is the next generation.\"\n\nBut in Florida's just-completed legislative session, there were signs that even among Republican lawmakers, enthusiasm is waning for DeSantis' anti-woke agenda. A proposal he backed to ban the removal of Confederate monuments failed, as did another to ban rainbow flags and others with a \"political viewpoint\" from school and government buildings.\n\n\"He still is trying to pursue these culture wars,\" says Rep. Fentrice Driskell, the Democratic leader in Florida's House. \"The thing is, I think Floridians have lost a taste for them because we have more pressing issues, like property insurance rates that are the highest in the nation.\"\n\nDeSantis is in his second term as governor and can't run again. But state lawmakers are up for re-election in November, another reason support appears to be weakening for DeSantis' conservative agenda.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Phil Sears/AP hide caption\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis smiles as he ends his State of the State address during a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on March 7 in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nRon DeSantis, the arch-conservative, culture-warrior Florida governor who ironically saw his political career take off by defending and channeling former President Donald Trump, has decided to challenge him for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nHe made the announcement on Twitter, just ahead of a scheduled Twitter Spaces conversation with Twitter chief Elon Musk, who has become popular on the right since taking over the platform. DeSantis' use of Twitter as the platform for his announcement is almost certainly pointed at the former president.\n\n\"I'm running for president to lead our Great American Comeback,\" he tweeted, along with a video.\n\n\"Righting the ship requires restoring sanity to our society, normalcy to our communities and integrity to our institutions. Truth must be our foundation - and common sense can no longer be an uncommon virtue. In Florida, we proved that it can be done,\" he says in the video. \"We chose facts over fear, education over indoctrination, law and order over rioting and disorder. We held the line when freedom hung in the balance.\"\n\nI'm running for president to lead our Great American Comeback. pic.twitter.com/YmkWkLaVDg\n\nEarlier Wednesday, DeSantis, 44, took the official step of filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for president.\n\nDeSantis' decision comes after months of speculation, but Trump hasn't waited to begin the attacks. Trump and a political action committee supporting him have spent millions of dollars hammering the Florida governor, and DeSantis' polling numbers have cratered, putting him in a deeper a hole than he and his allies had anticipated.\n\nTrump had appeared vulnerable - with multiple legal threats and a poor showing among Trump-backed candidates in the midterm elections. Polls had shown a significant number of Republicans searching for someone else to be their standard-bearer. And DeSantis was the first name on many conservatives' lips. But that's no longer the case.\n\nTrump's standing has improved considerably in the last three months, and if DeSantis is going to beat Trump, he's going to have to turn the narrative in his favor quickly just months until the first early state nominating contest in Iowa.\n\nOne thing DeSantis does have, though, is money. He has about $90 million left over from his reelection bid for governor last year, and a super PAC supporting him expects to have a $200 million budget , half of which is being devoted to voter outreach in key early states and some 2,600 field organizers.\n\nDeSantis' entry shouldn't be confused with part of an anti-Trump or \"Never Trump\" effort. He's been seen as a more disciplined and calculating version of the former president - even if he owes much of his success to Trump.\n\nIt's not an easy task to go from congressman to governor. DeSantis was helped greatly in the GOP primary because of Trump's endorsement - and he clung to Trump to initially win the governorship.\n\nHe even ran an ad showing him playing and reading to his children, helping one to \"build the wall\" with paper blocks and reading from Trump's The Art of the Deal , noting that he loves the part where Trump says, \"You're fired.\"\n\nTrump has used that against him, whacking DeSantis for disloyalty in a widely run ad.\n\nDeSantis now says his ad was \"satirical,\" \"tongue in cheek\" and \"many years ago.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign is up on TV with this 60-second spot. Airing nationally This is the first TV ad spending of the 2024 cycle from @TeamTrump pic.twitter.com/UzGxcm2w0d\n\nDeSantis has gained popularity with the GOP base - even as others have cringed - because of his governance in Florida.\n\nDeSantis became one of the loudest voices defiantly opposing the expert guidance of Dr. Anthony Fauci during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic; he pulled stunts, shipping migrants to Martha's Vineyard and other liberal enclaves and cities run by Democrats; and DeSantis has pugilistically  taken on universities, school districts and even Disney for how sexual orientation, gender identity and race are taught in schools.\n\nDeSantis has made the culture wars central to his political identity - and intends to run that way in the GOP primary race for president.\n\nHis right-wing, Trumpian tendencies have put him at odds, at times, with his potential base of Republican supporters, the kinds of Republicans who would be open to voting for someone other than Trump. It's hard to out-Trump Trump, and the people inclined to go a different way than Trump in the primary tend to be college-educated and wealthier Republicans, according to the February NPR/PBS NewsHour /Marist poll .\n\nOn foreign policy, DeSantis' initial stance on Ukraine echoed Trump, but put him at odds with GOP traditionalists. DeSantis dismissed its war with Russia as a \"territorial dispute\" that the U.S. shouldn't be involved in.\n\nHe walked that back after criticism . He went on to call Russia's Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal,\" and added, \"It's just - it's a messy situation. But Russia did not have a right to go in to Crimea or to go in February of 2022. And that should be clear.\"\n\nDeSantis' policies have stirred controversy nationally, but also elevated his profile with conservatives.\n\nIt made him a principal alternative to Trump at a time when Trump's brand was suffering.\n\nTrump's continued lies about the 2020 presidential election he lost, defeats racked up by candidates he backed in swing states and competitive districts, plus the myriad investigations in multiple states was giving Republicans pause about the 76-year-old former president.\n\nThe February NPR/PBS NewsHour /Marist poll even found DeSantis was better liked than Trump, particularly with GOP-leaning independents.\n\nThat was until the onslaught from Trump and his allies against DeSantis. There have been countless attacks that have gone unanswered and left DeSantis allies wringing their hands .\n\nThe brutal attacks - from the serious, relating to taxes, Social Security and Medicare, to the shallow, mocking DeSantis for how he reportedly ate pudding - have shown Trump is willing to do whatever it takes to win.\n\nDeSantis, on the other hand, is untested on the national stage and, to this point, has yet to show that same degree of ruthlessness in return.\n\nHe has so far only delicately drawn delineations with Trump, for example, on abortion rights. After Trump took credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade during a CNN town hall, DeSantis staked out a position to the right of Trump after Trump called Florida's six-week ban \"too harsh.\"\n\nDeSantis has also only been lightly critical of Trump's legal entanglements and governing style. He implied problematic \" underlying conduct \" and said he doesn't \"know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.\"\n\nWithout naming Trump, DeSantis praised his own \"no daily drama\" approach to being governor.\n\nAnother point that candidates have not made a bigger issue is the fact that Trump is constitutionally limited. If he were to win in 2024, he could only serve four more years.\n\nFor many conservatives, DeSantis, 44, offers a younger, less chaotic, longer-term alternative, but DeSantis himself hasn't really made that argument explicitly yet.\n\nDeSantis is also already trying to combat a narrative that he lacks a certain charm as a candidate. Stories are highlighting how he's retail politicking in early states.\n\nUnlike Trump, who can make his rallies seem more like a comedy routine for the MAGA base, DeSantis tends to appear more austere in public events. He can also be prickly, like when he berated students for wearing masks behind him accusing them of \"COVID theater.\"\n\nDeSantis is now the fifth major GOP candidate to announce his presidential bid. In addition to Trump, also running are: former Florida Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former tech CEO Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nAs many as half a dozen others are considering getting in, including former Trump Vice President Mike Pence, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\nThere are cautionary tales of GOP candidates who have risen and fallen sharply. During the 2016 Republican primary campaign, for example, Jeb Bush, also a former Florida governor and political scion, then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and even neurosurgeon Ben Carson had fleeting moments atop the polls .\n\nUltimately, Trump won in the crowded field because of his stronghold on a sizable chunk of the GOP base, much of which he retains.\n\nThe same is possible this time around.\n\nBecause Trump has such a solid hold on a significant slice of the GOP pie, the larger the field, the better for Trump if other-than-Trump Republican voters don't coalesce around one alternative.\n\nThe crowded field certainly could also point to a protracted GOP primary if no one sweeps the early states.\n\nA lot can change between now and then, as the real campaign is just getting started.\n\nA previous version of this story mistakenly identified Nikki Haley as the former governor of Florida. She is the former governor of South Carolina.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Monday banning the state's public colleges and universities from spending money on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\n\"If you look at the way this has actually been implemented across the country, DEI is better viewed as standing for discrimination, exclusion and indoctrination,\" DeSantis said during a news conference at New College of Florida in Sarasota. \"And that has no place in our public institutions.\"\n\nMany institutions across the U.S. have DEI offices aimed at diversifying staff and to promote inclusivity for faculty and students.\n\nThe location of the bill signing is notable as DeSantis has targeted New College of Florida to put it in a more conservative direction. Earlier this year, he appointed six new members to the school's board of trustees , putting conservative allies in control of the board. He accused the school's leadership of overemphasizing DEI, critical race theory and gender ideology, which he characterized as not \"what a liberal arts education should be.\"\n\nDeSantis said Monday that he's viewed DEI initiatives as a discriminatory practice. \"This bill says the whole experiment with DEI is coming to an end in the state of Florida. We are eliminating the DEI programs.\"\n\nThe new law also bans what can be taught in the state's higher education institutions. General education courses can't \"distort significant historical events or include a curriculum that teaches identity politics,\" or critical race theory.\n\nThis effort is part of DeSantis' larger work to crack down on what he calls \"woke indoctrination\" in schools . In the last two years, state education officials have rejected dozens of mathematics and social studies textbooks for students in K-12 schools.\n\nTexas has been working on a similar bill banning DEI programs in its own state university system.\n\n\"When you see elected leaders demonizing educators and weaponizing education, it's a five-alarm fire for democracy,\" Irene Mulvey, president of The American Association of University Professors, told Nature . \"It important to understand that when governors attack DEI efforts, they completely mischaracterize them to create a straw-man demon that they now have to do away with.\"\n\nThe law will go into effect on July 1.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis have called off their lawsuit stemming from a yearlong legal dispute. It involves the district that's home to Disney's central Florida resort. Walt Disney World Resort via Get hide caption\n\nThe Walt Disney Company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have called off their lawsuit stemming from a yearlong legal dispute. It involves the district that's home to Disney's central Florida resort.\n\nMIAMI - The Walt Disney Company and a board appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis say they've reached a settlement that resolves a yearlong legal dispute.\n\nIt involves the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, which encompasses the 40-square-mile property that's home to the Walt Disney World resort. DeSantis and Republican lawmakers created a new board for the district after they approved a law revoking Disney's self-governing status.\n\nThe settlement resolves lawsuits over a last-minute agreement Disney signed with its old board last year before it was dissolved by DeSantis and the Florida Legislature. That agreement would have taken power away from the new board and reserved for Disney all decisions concerning development at the theme parks. Under the settlement, that deal is now \"null and void.\"\n\nAt a meeting Wednesday, the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board said it will now work with Disney to update the district's 2020 comprehensive plan.\n\nBut a little later in the day, at a news conference in Orlando, DeSantis took aim at critics in the media and elsewhere who predicted that Disney would win its lawsuits and take back its self-governing status.\n\n\"The reality is here we are a year later and not one of them has succeeded,\" DeSantis said. \"Every action we have taken has been upheld in full. And the state's better off for it.\"\n\nIt's the apparent end of a political battle that began in 2022 when DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education Act . The law, dubbed \"Don't Say Gay\" by critics, restricts how sexual orientation and gender identity are discussed in the schools. Disney's former CEO Bob Chapek spoke out against the law and said he'd work to overturn it. That angered DeSantis, who then worked with Republican lawmakers to pass a measure revoking Disney's self-governing status.\n\nDeSantis appointed a new board to oversee the district. Disney challenged the move in federal court but lost. It's appealing that lawsuit. But Wednesday, Disney and the DeSantis-appointed board announced they had settled all the lawsuits pending in state court and are ready to move forward together.\n\n\"This agreement opens a new chapter of constructive engagement with the new leadership of the district and serves the interests of all parties by enabling significant continued investment and the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs and economic opportunity in the State,\" Walt Disney World Resort President Jeff Vahle said.\n\nAnother factor in the settlement appears to be two appointments also announced Wednesday. DeSantis named a new member to the district's board, Craig Mateer. Mateer formerly owned a tourism-related company in Orlando. At DeSantis' recommendation, the board appointed Stephanie Kopelousos as the new district administrator. Kopelousos had served as a former Clay County manager and was legislative and intergovernmental affairs director for DeSantis.\n\nWith the settlement, Disney is indicating that the current structure, operating under a board appointed by Florida's governor, is one it can work with. Disney CEO Bob Iger has announced plans to spend at least $30 billion to upgrade its theme parks over the next decade, including some $17 billion in Orlando.\n\nRick Foglesong, a retired professor and author of Married to the Mouse , which chronicles Disney's relationship with Florida, says the settlement is a win for both Disney and DeSantis. \"I think they both needed to escape from the imbroglio in which they found themselves, that it wasn't working for either one of them.\"\n\nFoglesong says the settlement clears the way for the expansion plans to go forward. Disney, he says, \"needed to continue to invest here without appearing weak, as if they were caving to DeSantis. They need to keep tourists coming back. They need to reinvest in the parks.\"\n\nIn recent months, DeSantis has also indicated that he was also ready to move on from the fight. In campaign speeches in his run for the Republican presidential nomination, DeSantis often brought up his fight with Disney. Once that candidacy ended, he began moving to put the issue behind him. In a state where tourism accounts for nearly 10% of jobs, fighting with the operator of one of the state's most popular destinations may not have been seen as a winning long-term strategy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis speaks at a campaign stop at Pub 52 on Jan. 15 in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose hardline right-wing policies in his state garnered much public attention and made him an early favorite for the 2024 presidential race, suspended his bid for the Republican nomination on Sunday in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nDeSantis also endorsed former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\"If there was anything I could do to produce a more favorable outcome - more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it,\" he said. \"But I can't ask our volunteers to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.\"\n\nDeSantis then proceeded to urge voters to support Trump, arguing that he is \"superior\" to President Biden.\n\n\"He [Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form or warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.\"\n\nDeSantis' exit from the Republican presidential nomination field creates a path for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the only conservative alternative to Trump's candidacy left in the race. Trump and Haley will square off in the New Hampshire GOP primary on Tuesday.\n\nAt an event of her own in New Hampshire on Sunday, Haley announced the news of DeSantis' decision to cheering supporters.\n\n\"He ran a great race,\" she said. \"He's been a good governor and we wish him well.\"\n\nBut Haley quickly pivoted the focus back to the race on Tuesday. \"It's now one fella and one lady left,\" she said, referring to the race between herself and Trump for the GOP nomination. \"All the fellas are out except for this one, and this comes down to what do you want.\"\n\nDeSantis came in second place in the Iowa GOP caucuses , according to results from The Associated Press, garnering 21.2% of votes, behind Trump, who won 51.0% of the vote. Haley placed third, at 19.1%.\n\nThere have been real questions about DeSantis' campaign after his distant second-place finish in Iowa. He pledged to continue and focus on South Carolina, but his campaign and super PAC supporting him, which had spent tens of millions supporting him, has spent nothing on campaign ads since Iowa.\n\nDeSantis' main campaign message was that he would be better at delivering the same kinds of policies that Trump would be in favor of, because he doesn't have the same baggage that Trump carries from his numerous indictments and federal charges. He vowed to rid the country of \"wokeism,\" a term he often used to criticize liberal policies, win the presidency by a wide margin, and deliver on issues that Republicans care about - much like how he says he has in Florida.\n\n\"Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for her donors' issues, I'm running for your issues, your family's issues, and solely to turn this country around,\" DeSantis said in a video posted shortly before the Iowa caucuses began on Jan. 15. \"I'm the only one that's beaten the left on issue, after issue, after issue.\"\n\nDeSantis was elected to Congress in 2012, to represent Florida's 6th Congressional District, and came to national focus in recent years - namely, for how he's governed Florida. He became a favorite among conservatives for his policies in the state, ranging from attacks on gender-affirming care , to banning diversity and equity initiatives in public colleges , resisting public health measures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sending migrants who had crossed the border illegally to progressive states.\n\nWhile DeSantis tried to carry his conservative record as governor into his presidential campaign, there were two things standing in his way: Trump, whose broad support among conservatives across the country remains unmatched; and DeSantis himself.\n\nFrom the start, the DeSantis campaign was plagued with complications and personnel issues . DeSantis announced his campaign on a livestream with Elon Musk on X, formerly known as Twitter, only for the event to be riddled with embarrassing technical malfunctions .\n\nMore recently, a watchdog group filed a legal complaint about the structure of the Florida governor's super PAC, which had already gone through a series of leadership resignations . A top strategist in the super PAC also resigned following a Washington Post piece that detailed the PAC's internal troubles.\n\nDeSantis looked to establish strong momentum in the early contests in the nation, campaigning in all of Iowa's 99 counties . He picked up the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical Christian leader Bob Vander Plaats, who had a record of endorsing past candidates who went on to win the Iowa GOP caucuses.\n\nBut after the caucuses in the Hawkeye state concluded, DeSantis split his focus between the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, and the upcoming contest in South Carolina.\n\nToward the end of his campaign, DeSantis began to throw harder jabs at Trump himself. During a visit to New Hampshire in December, DeSantis said he thought Trump wouldn't accept the results of the contests.\n\n\"If Trump loses, he will say it's stolen no matter what, absolutely,\" he told reporters . \"He will try to delegitimize the results.\"\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis speaks at a meeting with other Republican governors and President-elect Donald Trump, at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach earlier this month. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has called lawmakers to a special session of the Florida Legislature Monday to take up a series of proposals on immigration. But it's not clear what measures, if any, will be considered as key Republican lawmakers have called the session \"premature.\"\n\nFlorida is one of several states where Republican leaders say they support President Trump's pledge for the mass deportation of immigrants who don't have legal status in the U.S. DeSantis announced the special session earlier this month , a week before Trump's inauguration. He said he'd spoken to Trump about his plans for curbing illegal immigration and mass deportations and that the state should take a leading role.\n\n\"State and local officials in Florida must help the Trump administration enforce our nation's immigration laws,\" DeSantis said. \"In order to do that effectively, we are going to need legislation to impose additional duties on local officials and provide funding for those local officials.\" His call for the session said illegal immigration has caused \"massive costs\" for Americans.\n\nAmong the proposals DeSantis wants is one requiring counties and cities to participate in the federal deportation program and he's seeking the authority to suspend any officials, including those who were elected, who don't comply. He proposes making it a state crime to enter the U.S. illegally. And he wants to require people to show identification and their immigration status before sending remittances abroad. That could essentially prohibit anyone here without legal status from sending money back home.\n\nWith the new administration in the White House, the issue of immigration is once again rippling through state capitals across the country. Some of the proposals by DeSantis are similar to measures that other Republican-led states have passed or proposed and some have faced court challenges. Meanwhile, states led by Democrats have already gone to court to temporarily block the Trump administration's plan to end birthright citizenship, the legal principle that grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis has the authority to convene special sessions and has done so before. But when he called this one the Republican leaders in the state House and Senate surprised many by pushing back.\n\nThey say they support President Trump's pledge to combat illegal immigration but want to deal with it and other issues identified by DeSantis on their own schedule. In a letter to the governor , Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez wrote, \"As the people's elected representatives, the Legislature, not the Governor, will decide when and what legislation we consider.\"\n\nIt's a marked change from the last six years when the legislature largely went along with what DeSantis wanted, from rejecting federal COVID guidance to sparking a political and eventually legal battle with the Walt Disney Company . It's a sign that as a governor now in his final term, DeSantis may no longer have the political clout to run the party and the state as he did.\n\nEven if they don't pass this week, the measures proposed by DeSantis are raising concerns in a state where one out of every five people is an immigrant . Tessa Petit, who heads the Florida Immigrant Coalition , says the executive orders and actions taken by the Trump administration so far already have immigrant communities shaken. If DeSantis' proposal to give local law enforcement the powers of immigration agents passes, she says, it will only increase the fear.\n\n\"People are going to be afraid of police officers,\" she says. \"People are going to be afraid to report crimes. That's going to create a very strong divide between law enforcement and community members.\"\n\nPetit also says blocking remittances will send shockwaves not just through immigrant communities here, but also to other countries like Haiti and Nicaragua that depend heavily on money from people in the U.S. She says cracking down on remittances could further destabilize these places and drive up migration.\n\nIn Tallahassee, at least for now, DeSantis says he could call lawmakers back into another special session if they don't act now. \"You can view me as like a dog that's got you on the ankle on immigration ,\" he said last week. \"I am not just going to let go.\" Republican leaders point out that the legislature meets for its regular session in just over a month. And they say they want to deal with immigration and other issues \"at the appropriate time.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption\n\nCars line-up to enter Walt Disney World on February 08, 2023 in Orlando, Florida.\n\nMIAMI - The Walt Disney Company has filed a lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other officials. Disney accuses DeSantis with orchestrating a \"campaign of government retaliation\" against the company and violating its protected speech.\n\nIt's the latest action in a feud that began more than a year ago when Disney's former CEO said he'd work to overturn a law banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in the schools. The law, the \" Parental Rights in Education Act ,\" is called \"Don't Say Gay\" by critics.\n\nAt DeSantis' urging, Republican lawmakers passed a bill that stripped Disney of its self-governing authority . But before the law took effect, Disney signed a deal with its outgoing board allowing it to retain development rights on the 40-square mile district. It also included covenants that give Disney final say on any alterations to the property.\n\nAt a meeting Wednesday near Orlando, DeSantis' handpicked board voted to invalidate that agreement. Moments later, Disney filed a 77-page lawsuit in federal court, charging DeSantis and other officials with violations of the contracts clause, the takings clause, due process and its First Amendment right to protected speech. In its lawsuit, Disney says, \"This government action was patently retaliatory, patently anti-business, and patently unconstitutional.\" The company is asking a federal judge to declare the board's action \"unlawful and unenforceable.\"\n\nBefore voting to invalidate Disney's development deal, the district board heard a lengthy presentation from its lawyers detailing what they said were procedural missteps made by Disney's lawyers that, in their view, rendered it \"void and unenforceable.\" They said all parties had not received proper notice of the vote on the agreement and that it should have also been approved by the district's two cities. Disney maintains proper notices were sent out and that the development deal was approved in an open meeting in compliance with Florida law.\n\nBefore voting to strike down Disney's development deal, the new district board heard from a number of independent business owners who have restaurants and retail shops at Disney properties. Several said they were concerned new regulations and taxes could raise their costs and make their businesses unprofitable. Gov. DeSantis has talked about raising taxes and putting toll roads in the district. He's also discussed using some of the land for additional development and even a new prison. Board chairman Martin Garcia told business owners their taxes would be going up, in part to pay for legal fees related to the the DeSantis' dispute with Disney.\n\nDebra Mcdonald, a resident of Celebration, a community originally built by Disney that is adjacent to the theme park told the board that, because of the ongoing feud, \"many in our community are afraid.\" McDonald said, \"It has hurt us deeply. It's not just between the Governor and Disney. It affecting everyone around him.\"\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, DeSantis' communications director Taryn Fenske said, \"We are unaware of any legal right that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state. This lawsuit is yet another unfortunate example of their hope to undermine the will of the Florida voters and operate outside the bounds of the law.\"\n\nDeSantis is currently overseas on an international trade mission.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis took control over Disney World's special district\n\nBy\n\nEmily Olson\n\nIn an aerial view, Walt Disney World's iconic Cinderella Castle is seen on the grounds of the theme park this February. On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took control of Disney's special tax district. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption\n\nIn an aerial view, Walt Disney World's iconic Cinderella Castle is seen on the grounds of the theme park this February. On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took control of Disney's special tax district.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Monday to take control of municipal services and development for the special zone encompassing Walt Disney World. The move deals a major blow to the company's ability to operate with autonomy.\n\nDeSantis says that the special district surrounding Disney World has enabled the park to unfairly skirt local rules and building codes.\n\nBut DeSantis' critics say the bill looks like retaliation for a growing feud between Disney and the governor, which hit a tipping point last year. DeSantis said Disney \"crossed the line\" by opposing an education bill that restricts classroom discussion around gender identity and sexual orientation .\n\nHere's a rundown of the situation.\n\n\"The corporate kingdom finally comes to an end,\" DeSantis said during a news conference announcing the move on Monday . \"There's a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.\"\n\nThe heart of the bill is the appointment of a five-person state board to oversee municipal services, such as fire protection and road maintenance, where Disney World operates.\n\nThe newly appointed board will have the ability to raise revenue to fund services and pay off Disney's debts. DeSantis' previous pledge to strip Disney of its special tax status sparked fears that local taxpayers would be left on the hook, which would, in turn, spark a significant spike in local tax rates.\n\nDeSantis stressed on Monday that under the new structure , Disney would still be responsible for its municipal debts and local governments would not raise taxes.\n\nThe governor said the five board members include people who \"very much want to see Disney be what Walt envisioned,\" implying that Disney's values wouldn't be negatively impacted.\n\nThe members include Martin Garcia, whose private investment firm regularly donates to Republican candidates , Michael Sasso, a local elections lawyer , and Bridget Ziegler, a conservative school board member and wife of the Florida Republican Party chairman.\n\nIn press materials released with the bill signing, DeSantis' office said the bill would also end some of Disney's other special privileges, such as exemption from state regulatory reviews.\n\nThe creation of the self-governing zone, known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, was instrumental to Disney's decision to build its theme park near Orlando in the 1960s, according to WMFE reporter Amy Green.\n\nThe zone sits on nearly 25,000 acres, sandwiched between Orange and Osceola counties. Once a remote and rural area, the Reedy Creek Improvement District received electricity, water, roads and police thanks to Disney's investments.\n\nAccording to a local tax collector, Disney has taxed itself roughly $53 million each year to pay off the debts from that development.\n\nDisney did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment, but the company has previously told media outlets that it wouldn't fight the government takeover.\n\nDisney, which employs nearly 80,000 people in central Florida , wields great influence in the state.\n\nThe company donated to DeSantis during the 2020 election cycle . In 2021, the governor's staff reportedly worked with Disney to give it an exemption from a law designed to crack down on big tech companies.\n\nBut the relationship between the two started to sour that same year after Disney took a stricter stance on preventing the spread of COVID-19, mandating its workers show proof of vaccination and its theme park guests continue to wear face coverings.\n\nAt the same time, Disney was increasingly drawing criticism from conservatives for making changes to its parks and films to increase inclusivity. Disney World closed Splash Mountain, for example, after a petition accusing it of \"stereotypical racist tropes\" gained 21,000 signatures.\n\nDeSantis, who has been fighting what he calls \"woke indoctrination,\" said the company \"crossed the line\" when Disney CEO Bob Chapek said he'd support the repeal of Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act , known by its critics as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill.\n\nDeSantis immediately turned Chapek's statement into a fundraising point. A month later, he introduced legislation on revoking Disney's special tax status .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis speaks to attendees at the Republican Party of Florida Freedom Summit on Nov. 4, 2023 in Kissimmee, Fla.\n\nThe Republican presidential field continues to narrow and former President Donald Trump has held on to a commanding lead ahead of primary contests. That includes a sizable lead in Florida - where one of his lead opponents, Ron DeSantis, is the governor.\n\nDespite winning a landslide election in the state two years ago, DeSantis hasn't been able to win over enough base GOP voters there.

She said she supported and voted for DeSantis when he ran to lead the state for the first time a few years ago.\n\n\"I'm a little upset that he's out campaigning as president because I voted for him to do a job here as governor,\" she explained. \"And while he's out campaigning, he's not doing his governorship job. And I'm not the only Floridian that feels that way. And we need him back here to govern. That's what we elected him for.\"\n\nAlvarez said he agrees. Ultimately, he likes the job that DeSantis has done as governor. He said he's been a \"good governor,\" but he shouldn't have jumped into the presidential election when Trump was already in.\n\nMaltais said DeSantis' decision is particularly egregious because Trump helped DeSantis win the first time he ran for Florida governor.\n\n\"He backstabbed our president,\" she said. \"And now I have no respect for DeSantis. I'm sorry. I don't.\"\n\n\"I won't vote for him again.\"\n\nAttendees show their support for former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Hialeah, Fla., on Nov. 8. Lynne Sladky/AP hide caption\n\nAttendees show their support for former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Hialeah, Fla., on Nov. 8.\n\nTrump currently has more than a 30 point lead over DeSantis in his own state. That lead hasn't changed significantly since the governor jumped into the race for president.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Randy Fine has been one of DeSantis' most vocal supporters in the Florida Legislature. But recently he announced he's backing Trump in the GOP primary.\n\nFine is the only Jewish Republican in the legislature and he says he's been unimpressed with DeSantis' response to the Hamas attack against Israel last month, which was a breaking point for him. He says he just can't support DeSantis' presidential bid anymore.\n\n\"I don't think he's been a bad governor,\" Fine told NPR. \"I think he's generally done well. It's just on a lot of these issues related to Jewish Floridians, he's broken my heart.\n\n\"I don't see him winning,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, Bryan Griffin - a spokesman for the DeSantis campaign - said the governor \"has nearly universal support in the Florida legislature, where they have worked with him first-hand and know he can offer the same record of accomplishment to the country.\"\n\nRepublican state Rep. Mike Caruso echoed that and said most of his Republican colleagues stand by DeSantis.\n\n\"He's led the way from day one,\" he said. \"And I'm kind of disappointed that those few colleagues, the few members that have switched over to Trump's campaign.\"\n\nCaruso says he also thinks DeSantis has a strong record supporting Jewish Floridians. And, he says, he thinks more voters in Florida - and across the country - will soon start backing his governor as well.\n\nAfter all, he said, it's still too early in the primary election to completely rule out DeSantis.\n\n\"I think that as other candidates drop out, I think those votes will go towards Governor DeSantis,\" he predicted. \"He's just got to wait it out and keep working hard and campaigning hard.\"\n\nUltimately, Fine says, he doesn't have a big issue with DeSantis spending time running for president. In fact, he said it makes sense if you look at the political reality that Florida's governor finds himself in.\n\nDeSantis is currently in his second and final term as governor. He can't run again because Florida has term limits.\n\n\"I think that's part of the reason why he did run,\" Fine explained. \"He wanted to run for president as the governor of Florida and not as the former governor of Florida.\"\n\nIn this Jan. 22, 2019, photo, Rep.

Ron DeSantis speaks at a news conference at Crooms Academy of Information Technology in Sanford to discuss Florida's civics education initiative of unbiased history teachings.

Ron DeSantis speaks at a news conference at Crooms Academy of Information Technology in Sanford to discuss Florida's civics education initiative of unbiased history teachings.\n\nMIAMI - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made it clear how he views public schools and what they're teaching children: He doesn't trust them.\n\nAt a recent news conference, he returned to a familiar theme.\n\n\"Following woke indoctrination in our schools, that is a road to ruin for this country,\" he said. \"And we're not going to let it happen in Florida.\"\n\nSince becoming governor in 2019, DeSantis has become known for taking combative positions on controversial issues, including education. He recently signed a number of measures aimed at preventing the sort of \"indoctrination\" he and his Republican supporters fear is taking place.\n\nHis \"Stop Woke\" act sets limits on how issues involving race may be taught. And it allows parents to sue teachers and school districts that violate it.\n\nAnother measure, the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed \"Don't Say Gay\" by critics, bans any instruction involving sexual orientation or gender identity in the earliest grades and says beyond that it must be \"age appropriate.\"\n\nIn a June interview with the Christian fundamentalist group, Focus on the Family, DeSantis said he believes there's a \"concerted effort to inject ... gender ideology and sexuality into the discussions with the very youngest kids.\"\n\nCritics of the law say that's not true. They believe the law is part of an effort by DeSantis and Republicans to mobilize the party's conservative base by targeting the LGBTQ community.\n\nRobert Cassanello, an associate professor of History at the University of Central Florida, says although the law just took effect this month, it's already had an impact.\n\n\"There have been high school teachers that have reported to me that they have been told by their superiors don't mention gay, lesbian or any sexuality on class,\" he says. \"Don't even approach this with 11 th and 12 th graders. And these were things they had previously taught.\"\n\nCassanello, who teaches civil rights history, is part of a lawsuit challenging the limits on teaching about race that are part of DeSantis' Stop Woke Act.\n\nDeSantis' focus on the schools took shape with the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2020, when he began battling with school districts over face masks and other issues. Since then, he's made parental rights one of his main issues, taking aim at school boards and administrators who he believes need to be held accountable.\n\nIn his Focus on the Family interview, he said, \"There's an element on the far left that believes parents really have no role in the education of their kids. You drop them off at school ... and they impose the ideology and worldview that they want.\"\n\nDeSantis' administration has also turned its attention to Florida's state-supported university system, adopting policies that critics say undermine academic freedom.\n\nA kindergarten class at Redland Elementary in south Miami-Dade on Oct. 5, 2020, the first day that Miami-Dade public school students returned to their classrooms due to the coronavirus pandemic. Jose A. Iglesias/El Nuevo Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA kindergarten class at Redland Elementary in south Miami-Dade on Oct. 5, 2020, the first day that Miami-Dade public school students returned to their classrooms due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThree professors at the University of Florida sued last year after they were told they couldn't testify in a lawsuit challenging a voting rights law DeSantis supported. A judge ruled in their favor, but not before the university's accrediting organization, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, opened an investigation. SACS concluded the university met all its standards for academic integrity. In response, DeSantis signed a bill passed by lawmakers requiring universities to periodically change their accrediting organizations.\n\nCassanello says, \"The Florida legislature is removing all accountability in the accreditation system because they're mad at SACS for taking an interest in academic freedom.\"\n\nThe state has also asked faculty and students to begin participating in voluntary \"viewpoint diversity surveys\" to see if conservative ideas are being repressed on campuses.\n\nMore recently, DeSantis rolled out a civics education initiative that he says will make sure students in elementary, middle and high schools aren't taught a distorted view of history.\n\n\"You're learning the real history. You're learning the real facts,\" he said. \"It's not going to be done in a way to indoctrinate students with whatever modern agenda someone may have.\"\n\nBarbara Segal, a high school government teacher in Fort Lauderdale, recently took a three-day training session on Florida's new civics standards. She says, \"They were pushing an ideological agenda.\" In the training materials, Segal says, slides said it was a \"misconception\" that the Founding Fathers wanted strict separation of church and state and that they in fact wanted religion to be promoted.\n\nSome of the most jarring material seemed to downplay the role of slavery in the country's founding, including one that stated that only 4 percent of enslaved people from Africa came to the colonies.\n\n\"Which means,\" Segal concluded, \"we're not that bad.\"\n\nAs first reported by the Miami Herald , the training materials were prepared for the state by groups including the Bill of Rights Institute, founded by Charles Koch and Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in Michigan that is influential in developing conservative education policies.\n\nSegal, a teacher with 18 years in the classroom, says DeSantis is pushing a false narrative that schools are promoting a \"woke\" progressive agenda.\n\n\"I hate to say this,\" she says, \"but I feel that maybe, possibly he's pandering to a base for re-election and that's very hurtful.\"\n\nDeSantis is running for re-election as governor in November but is also widely seen as a likely contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nAll this comes as Florida is facing a critical teacher shortage with more than 9,500 vacant jobs statewide.\n\nIn Brevard County, school board member Jennifer Jenkins says teachers are demoralized. Many have retired or found jobs in other fields. In her district, she says there are 20 vacancies at a single school that only has 40 staff members.\n\n\"I don't know how we're going to continue to live in this hostile environment, how we're going to encourage educators to enter the field and stick around,\" Jenkin says. \"It's really, really scary.\"\n\nSchool board members have become a particular target. Jenkins has had protesters outside her home, vandalism, and threats of violence stemming for her support for a school face mask mandate.\n\nDeSantis has now begun endorsing candidates running for school board seats, races that have long been non-partisan. And his gubernatorial re-election campaign has released a survey for school board members that includes questions about parental rights, school choice and critical race theory.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "How Ron DeSantis Blew Up Black-Held Congressional Districts and May Have Broken Florida Law\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis was incensed. Late last year, the state's Republican legislature had drawn congressional maps that largely kept districts intact, leaving the GOP with only a modest electoral advantage.\n\nDeSantis threw out the legislature's work and redrew Florida's congressional districts, making them far more favorable to Republicans. The plan was so aggressive that the Republican-controlled legislature balked and fought DeSantis for months. The governor overruled lawmakers and pushed his map through.\n\nDeSantis' office has publicly stressed that partisan considerations played no role and that partisan operatives were not involved in the new map.\n\nA ProPublica examination of how that map was drawn - and who helped decide its new boundaries - reveals a much different origin story. The new details show that the governor's office appears to have misled the public and the state legislature and may also have violated Florida law.\n\nDeSantis aides worked behind the scenes with an attorney who serves as the national GOP's top redistricting lawyer and other consultants tied to the national party apparatus, according to records and interviews.\n\nFlorida's constitution was amended in 2010 to prohibit partisan-driven redistricting, a landmark effort in the growing movement to end gerrymandering as an inescapable feature of American politics.\n\nBarbara Pariente, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court who retired in 2019, told ProPublica that DeSantis' collaboration with people connected to the national GOP would constitute \"significant evidence of a violation of the constitutional amendment.\"\n\n\"If that evidence was offered in a trial, the fact that DeSantis was getting input from someone working with the Republican Party and who's also working in other states - that would be very powerful,\" said Pariente, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Democrat Lawton Chiles.\n\nA meeting invite obtained by ProPublica shows that on Jan. 5, top DeSantis aides had a \"Florida Redistricting Kick-off Call\" with out-of-state operatives. Those outsiders had also been working with states across the country to help the Republican Party create a favorable election map. In the days after the call, the key GOP law firm working for DeSantis logged dozens of hours on the effort, invoices show. The firm has since billed the state more than $450,000 for its work on redistricting.\n\nA week and a half after the call, DeSantis unveiled his new map. No Florida governor had ever pushed their own district lines before. His plan wiped away half of the state's Black-dominated congressional districts, dramatically curtailing Black voting power in America's largest swing state.\n\nOne of the districts, held by Democrat Al Lawson, had been created by the Florida Supreme Court just seven years before. Stretching along a swath of north Florida once dominated by tobacco and cotton plantations, it had drawn together Black communities largely populated by the descendants of sharecroppers and slaves. DeSantis shattered it, breaking the district into four pieces. He then tucked each fragment away in a majority-white, heavily Republican district.\n\nDeSantis Broke Up Black-Dominated District and Put Its Pieces Into 4 Majority-White Districts\n\nBlack Voting Age Population\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\nPre-2022 Districts\n\nDISTRICT 5\n\n46% Black\n\nJacksonville\n\nTallahassee\n\n2022 Districts\n\nDISTRICT 4\n\n32%\n\nDISTRICT 2\n\n23%\n\nJacksonville\n\nDISTRICT 5\n\n13%\n\nTallahassee\n\nDISTRICT 3\n\n16%\n\nBlack Voting Age Population\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\nPre-2022 Districts\n\nDISTRICT 5\n\n46% Black\n\nJacksonville\n\nTallahassee\n\n2022 Districts\n\nDISTRICT 4\n\n32%\n\nDISTRICT 2\n\n23%\n\nJacksonville\n\nDISTRICT 5\n\n13%\n\nTallahassee\n\nDISTRICT 3\n\n16%\n\nDeSantis' strong-arming of his Republican allies was covered extensively by the Florida press . But until now, little has emerged about how the governor crafted his bold move and who his office worked with. To reconstruct DeSantis' groundbreaking undertaking, ProPublica interviewed dozens of consultants, legislators and political operatives and reviewed thousands of pages of documents obtained through public records requests and from the nonpartisan watchdog group American Oversight.\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to detailed questions for this story.\n\n\"Florida's Governor fought for a legal map - unlike the gerrymandered plan the Governor rightly vetoed,\" Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, whose top lawyer was hired by DeSantis' office, said in an email to ProPublica. \"If Governor DeSantis retained some of the best redistricting lawyers and experts in the country to advise him then that speaks to the good judgment of the Governor, not some alleged partisan motive.\"\n\nIn four years as governor, DeSantis has championed an array of controversial policies and repeatedly used his power to punish his political opponents . A presumptive candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, he has often made moves that seemed tailored to attract headlines, such as his recent stunt sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard . But it's the governor's less flashy commandeering of the redistricting process that may ultimately have the most long-lasting consequences.\n\nAnalysts predict that DeSantis' map will give the GOP four more members of Congress from Florida, the largest gain by either party in any state. If the forecasts hold, Republicans will win 20 of Florida's 28 seats in the upcoming midterms - meaning that Republicans would control more than 70% of the House delegation in a state where Trump won just over half of the vote.\n\nThe reverberations of DeSantis' effort could go beyond Florida in another way. His erasure of Lawson's seat broke long-held norms and invited racial discrimination lawsuits, experts said. Six political scientists and law professors who study voting rights told ProPublica it's the first instance they're aware of where a state so thoroughly dismantled a Black-dominated district. If the governor prevails against suits challenging his map, he will have forged a path for Republicans all over the country to take aim at Black-held districts.\n\n\"To the extent that this is successful, it's going to be replicated in other states. There's no question,\" said Michael Latner, a political science professor at California Polytechnic State University who studies redistricting. \"The repercussions are so broad that it's kind of terrifying.\"\n\nAl Lawson's district, now wiped away by DeSantis, had been created in response to an earlier episode of surreptitious gerrymandering in Florida.\n\nTwelve years ago, Florida became one of the first states to outlaw partisan gerrymandering. Through a ballot initiative that passed with 63% of the vote, Florida citizens enshrined the so-called Fair Districts amendment in the state constitution. The amendment prohibited drawing maps with \"the intent to favor or disfavor a political party.\" It also created new protections for minority communities, in a state that's 17% Black, forming a backstop as the U.S. Supreme Court chipped away at the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\nFlorida elected its first Black member of Congress, a former slave named Josiah Walls, in 1870, shortly after the end of the Civil War. But Florida rapidly enacted new voter suppression laws, and Walls soon lost his office as Reconstruction gave way to the era of Jim Crow.\n\nThanks to distorted maps, Florida did not elect a second Black representative to Congress until 1992. That year, a federal court created three plurality-Black districts in Florida - and then three Black politicians won seats in the U.S. House.\n\nAfter the Fair Districts amendment became law in 2010, state legislators promised to conduct what one called \"the most transparent, open, and interactive redistricting process in America.\" Policymakers went on tour across the state, hosting public hearings where their constituents could learn about the legislature's decision-making and voice their concerns.\n\nThe hearings also served a more nefarious purpose, a judge would later rule. They were instrumental in what state circuit judge Terry Lewis described as \" a conspiracy to influence and manipulate the Legislature into a violation of its constitutional duty.\"\n\nFor months, a team of state-level Republican operatives worked in secret to craft maps that favored the GOP, coordinating with both statehouse leadership and the Republican National Committee. Then they recruited civilians to attend the hearings and submit the maps as their own.\n\nAn email detailed the advice the operatives gave their recruits. \"Do NOT identify oneself orally or in writing,\" it read, \"as a part of the Republican party. It is more than OK to represent oneself as just a citizen.\"\n\nIt took years of litigation for the details of the scheme to come to light. But in 2015, the Florida Supreme Court responded with force. In a series of rulings that ultimately rejected the Republicans' efforts, the court laid out the stringent new requirements under Fair Districts, making clear that partisan \"practices that have been acceptable in the past\" were now illegal in the state of Florida.\n\nAfter ruling that the legislature's process was unconstitutional, the court threw out the Republicans' congressional district lines and imposed a map of their own. That is how Lawson's district came to be.\n\n\"It was important,\" Pariente, who authored the key opinions, told ProPublica, \"to make sure the amendment had teeth and was enforceable.\"\n\nThe amendment took on even greater significance in 2019, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling on redistricting .\n\nThe court's decision in Rucho v. Common Cause barred federal court challenges to partisan gerrymanders. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said it was not an issue for the federal judiciary to decide, but emphasized the ruling did not \"condemn complaints about districting to echo into a void.\"\n\nIn fact, the issue was being actively addressed at the state level, Roberts wrote. He cited Florida's amendment and one of Pariente's opinions. Responding to liberal justices who wanted to reject Rucho's map as an unconstitutional gerrymander, Roberts wrote they could not because \"there is no 'Fair Districts Amendment' to the Federal Constitution.\"\n\nIn 2021, state legislative leaders were more careful.\n\nThe senate instructed its members to \"insulate themselves from partisan-funded organizations\" and others who might harbor partisan motivations, reminding legislators that a court could see conversations with outsiders as evidence of unconstitutional intent. The legislature imposed stringent transparency requirements, like publishing emails that it received from constituents. And they ordered their staff to base their decisions exclusively on the criteria \"adopted by the citizens of Florida.\"\n\nThe Senate leadership \"explained to us at the beginning of the session that because of what happened last cycle, everything had to go through the process,\" Sen. Joe Gruters, who is also chairman of the Florida Republican Party, told ProPublica.\n\nIn November, the state senate proposed maps that largely stuck to the status quo. Analysts predicted they would give Republicans 16 seats in Congress and Democrats 12.\n\n\"Were they the fairest maps you could draw? No,\" said Ellen Freidin, leader of the anti-gerrymandering advocacy group FairDistricts Now. \"But they weren't bad Republican gerrymanders.\"\n\nDeSantis wasn't satisfied. \"The governor's office was very pissed off about the map. They thought it was weak,\" said a well-connected Florida Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could be candid. \"They thought it was ridiculous to not even try to make it as advantageous as possible.\"\n\nIn early January, DeSantis' deputy chief of staff, Alex Kelly, was quietly assigned to oversee a small team that would devise an alternative proposal, according to Kelly's later testimony.\n\nState employees often spend years preparing for the redistricting process - time that DeSantis did not have. As Kelly and his colleagues set to work, they brought in critical help from the D.C. suburbs: Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election attorney and one of the leading GOP strategists for redistricting nationwide.\n\nOn Jan. 5, Kelly and two other top DeSantis aides had the redistricting \"kick-off call,\" according to the meeting invite, which was provided to ProPublica by American Oversight. The invitation included Torchinsky and another guest from out of state: Thomas Bryan, a redistricting specialist.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Bryan explained the connection between the national Republican Party and his work with DeSantis. \"There's a core group of attorneys that works with the party and then they work with specific states,\" he said. \"It's not a coincidence that I worked on Texas, Florida, Virginia, Kansas, Michigan, Alabama.\"\n\nHe added that the main lawyer he works with is Torchinsky: \"Jason will say, 'I want you to work on this state.'\"\n\nA top partner at a conservative law firm, Torchinsky has represented the RNC, the Republican Party of Florida and many of America's most influential right-wing groups, such as the Koch network's Americans for Prosperity .\n\nHe also occupies a central role in the Republican Party's efforts to swing Congress in its favor in 2022. Torchinsky is the general counsel and senior advisor to the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the entity the Republican National Committee helped set up to manage the party's redistricting operations.\n\nThe NRRT boasts millions of dollars in funding and a roster of prominent advisors that includes Mike Pompeo and Karl Rove. Earlier this year, Kincaid, the trust's executive director, summarized its objective bluntly: \"Take vulnerable incumbents off the board, go on offense and create an opportunity to take and hold the House for the decade.\"\n\nIn a statement to ProPublica, Kincaid said that the trust is one of Torchinsky's many clients and that the lawyer's work in Florida was separate: \"When I would ask Jason what was happening in Florida, he would tell me his conversations were privileged.\" Kincaid added that he personally did not speak with anyone in the DeSantis administration \"during this redistricting cycle.\"\n\nTorchinsky's involvement in the creation of DeSantis' map has not been previously reported. His role in the process appears to have been intimate and extensive, though the specifics of his contributions are largely unclear. He spent more than 100 hours working for the DeSantis administration on redistricting, according to invoices sent to the Florida Department of State.\n\nTorchinsky held repeated meetings with DeSantis' team as the group crafted maps and navigated the ensuing political battles, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. And he brought in other operatives who'd worked around the country in priority states for the national GOP.\n\nA week after the kickoff meeting, Torchinsky scheduled a Zoom call between Kelly, Bryan and a second consultant, Adam Foltz.\n\nFoltz and Bryan arrived in Florida just as they were becoming go-to mapmakers for the GOP. They appeared together in multiple states where the NRRT was directly involved last year, generating controversy in their wake.\n\nIn Texas, Foltz, Bryan and the NRRT's leader, Kincaid, all worked behind the scenes helping draw maps , court records show. After they finished, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state of Texas, contending that the map violated the Voting Rights Act and illegally diluted Black and Latino votes. The case is still pending.\n\nLast fall in Virginia, each party submitted three candidates to the state supreme court to guide the state's redistricting process. The Democrats put forward three professors . Republicans submitted Bryan, Foltz and Kincaid. The court's conservative majority rejected all three Republican nominees, citing conflicts of interest and \"concerns about the ability\" of the men to carry out the job neutrally.\n\nIn a statement, Kincaid said Foltz and Bryan are not partisan operatives and \"the Virginia Supreme Court erred\" in rejecting them. He also downplayed his own relationship to the consultants, saying they are not \"employees or retained consultants\" for his group.\n\n\"Adam and Tom are two of the best political demographers in the country,\" Kincaid wrote. \"It would only make sense that states looking for redistricting experts would retain them.\"\n\nUntil last year, Foltz had spent his entire career working in Wisconsin politics, on state GOP campaigns and for Republican state legislators, according to court records. He was introduced to redistricting a decade ago when he spent months helping craft maps that became notoriously effective Republican gerrymanders . When he testified under oath that partisanship played no role in the Wisconsin process, a three-judge panel dismissed his claim as \"almost laughable.\"\n\nBryan was also a new figure on the national stage. Before 2020, he was a \"bit player\" in the redistricting industry, he said, running a small consulting company based in Virginia. He'd drawn maps for school districts and for local elections, but never for Congress, and he held a second job in consumer analytics at a large tobacco conglomerate.\n\n\"In 2020, my phone started going off the hook, with states either asking to retain me as an expert or to actually draw the lines,\" Bryan told ProPublica. \"I get phone calls from random places, and I'm on the phone with a governor.\" While he mostly worked with Republicans, he was also retained by Illinois Democrats this cycle, according to court records.\n\nFoltz and Bryan's rapid ascension culminated in Florida. On Jan. 14, Torchinsky set up a third call with Foltz and Kelly. Then two days later, DeSantis released his map.\n\nAccording to Kelly's subsequent testimony, Foltz drew the map himself.\n\n\"I was completely blindsided,\" said Rep. Geraldine Thompson, a Democrat on the House redistricting committee. \"That is the purview of the legislature.\"\n\nFoltz declined an interview when reached by phone and did not respond to subsequent requests for comment. Kelly and Torchinsky, who went on to defend DeSantis in a lawsuit against the redistricting, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe House redistricting subcommittee later brought Kelly in to answer questions about DeSantis' proposals. Before the deputy chief of staff testified, the Democrats' ranking member moved to place him under oath. Republican legislators blocked the committee from swearing Kelly in.\n\nIn his opening statement, Kelly took pains to emphasize that the governor's office colored within the lines of the Florida constitution.\n\n\"I can confirm that I've had no discussions with any political consultant,\" he testified. \"No partisan operative. No political party official.\"\n\nThis appears to have been misleading. By the time he testified, Kelly had been personally invited to at least five calls to discuss redistricting with Torchinsky, Bryan or Foltz, records show.\n\nKelly mention ed Foltz only briefly in his testimony. Torchinsky and Bryan's names didn't come up.\n\nDeSantis holds as much sway in Tallahassee as any governor in recent memory. But even after he publicly weighed in with a map of his own, Republicans in the legislature didn't bow down. The state Senate refused to even consider the governor's version. In late January, they passed their original plan.\n\nDeSantis' aides argued that Lawson's district was an \"unconstitutional gerrymander,\" extending recent precedent that limits states' ability to deliberately protect Black voting power.\n\nFlorida Republicans were skeptical. House Speaker Chris Sprowls told reporters that DeSantis was relying on a \"novel legal argument\" that lawmakers were unlikely to adopt.\n\n\"In the absence of legal precedent,\" Sprowls said, \"we are going to follow the law.\"\n\nOn Feb. 11, DeSantis ratcheted up the pressure. He held a press conference reiterating his opposition to Lawson's district. He vowed to veto any map that left it intact. But he still needed to win over Republican policymakers. Again, DeSantis' top aides turned to Torchinsky.\n\nIn February, Torchinsky helped DeSantis' staff pick out an expert witness to sell the governor's vision to the legislature, according to emails provided to ProPublica by American Oversight. Once the group chose an expert, Torchinsky had a call with him in advance of his appearance.\n\nWith a deadline to prepare for the November midterms looming, the legislature moved toward compromise. In early March, it passed a new bill that was much closer to DeSantis' version - but still kept a Democrat-leaning district with a large Black population in North Florida.\n\nThe governor's attempts at persuasion were over.\n\nOn Mar. 28, Foltz and Kelly had another call, along with a partner at Torchinsky's law firm. The next day, DeSantis vetoed the compromise plan.\n\nDemocrats were outraged; many Republicans were shocked. \"A veto of a bill as significant as that was definitely surprising,\" Gruters, the state senator and chair of the Florida GOP, told ProPublica.\n\nKelly soon submitted a slightly modified version of Foltz's map to the legislature. This time, the legislature took DeSantis' proposal and ran with it.\n\nOn Apr. 20, Rep. Thomas Leek, the Republican chair of the House redistricting committee, formally presented DeSantis' plan before the general assembly. When his colleagues asked him who the governor's staff consulted while drawing the map, Leek told them that he didn't know.\n\n\"I can't speak to the governor's entire process,\" Leek said. \"I can only tell you what Mr. Kelly said.\"\n\nThe legislature had required everyone submitting a map to file a disclosure form listing the \"name of every person(s), group(s), or organization(s) you collaborated with.\" Kelly left the form blank.\n\nThe legislature voted on party lines and passed DeSantis' proposal the next day. Anticipating litigation, they also allocated $1 million to defend the map in court.\n\nBefore DeSantis even signed the bill into law, a coalition of advocacy groups filed a lawsuit challenging the map in state court.\n\nThey soon scored a major victory. Circuit Court Judge J. Layne Smith, a DeSantis appointee, imposed a temporary injunction that would keep Lawson's district intact through the midterm elections.\n\n\"This case is one of fundamental public importance, involving fundamental constitutional rights,\" Smith wrote. His ruling cited the lengthy history of Black voter suppression in North Florida and across the state.\n\nThat victory was short-lived. Torchinsky's firm quickly filed an appeal on DeSantis' behalf. Then, in a unanimous decision in late May, the appellate court allowed DeSantis' map to move ahead.\n\nThe higher court's opinion was authored by Adam Tanenbaum, a familiar face in Tallahassee. Until DeSantis appointed him to the court in 2019, Tanenbaum was the Florida House's general counsel, and before that he was general counsel to the Florida Department of State - both of which were parties to the case.\n\nThe very day Tanenbaum issued the opinion, he completed an application to fill a vacancy on the Florida Supreme Court, records show. In Florida, Supreme Court justices are appointed by the governor, in this case DeSantis.\n\nTanenbaum was not chosen for the position . He didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe broader case is still pending and is expected to eventually be decided by the state supreme court. Every justice on Florida's supreme court was appointed by Republicans. The majority of them were chosen by DeSantis .\n\nRead More\n\nThe deeply conservative body has already demonstrated its willingness to overturn precedent that's only a few years old.

      "text": "DeSantis Privately Called for Google to Be \"Broken Up\"\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis has frequently railed against \"Big Tech.\" He has accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of silencing conservative voices.\n\nBut in private, DeSantis has gone even further.\n\nIn previously unreported comments made in 2021, DeSantis said technology companies like Google \"should be broken up\" by the U.S. government.\n\nDeSantis, widely considered a presidential hopeful, made the remarks at an invite-only retreat for the Teneo Network, a \"private and confidential\" group for elite conservatives . ProPublica and Documented obtained video of the event.\n\n\"They're just too big, they have too much power,\" DeSantis said. \"I think they're exercising a more negative influence on our society than the trusts that got broken up at the early 20th century.\" He added that large tech companies \"are ruining our country. They're a very negative influence. And so I think you need to be strong about it.\"\n\nDeSantis' call to break up large tech companies occurred at the Teneo Network's annual retreat in 2021. As ProPublica and Documented recently reported, the Teneo Network aims to \"crush liberal dominance\" across many areas of American society, according to its chairman Leonard Leo, the influential legal activist and longtime leader of the Federalist Society.\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to requests seeking comment. Teneo declined to comment.\n\nIn recent years, \"Big Tech\" has emerged as a favored target for Republican lawmakers and activists, even as prominent conservatives have amassed huge followings on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms. Pointing to such high-profile examples as Donald Trump's suspension from Facebook and Twitter's decision to briefly block a story about Hunter Biden's laptop, Republicans claim that U.S. tech companies have systematically suppressed conservative viewpoints and interfered with elections in ways that have helped Democrats.\n\nA 2021 study issued by New York University researchers concluded those assertions were baseless . \"The claim of anti-conservative animus on the part of social media companies is itself a form of disinformation: a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it,\" the researchers for the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights wrote.\n\nLiberal lawmakers and policy experts have also called for stronger antitrust enforcement of major tech companies. During the 2020 presidential race, Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., campaigned on a platform of breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google , saying they had \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.\" In 2021, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation to split up tech firms , but the bills never became law.\n\nMatt Stoller, an antitrust expert who works at the American Economic Liberties Project, said it's hard to tell if DeSantis' private comments indicate genuine concern about corporate concentration of power or just anger at large firms perceived to be hostile to conservatives.\n\n\"There's a war on the right about antitrust,\" Stoller said. \"I'm skeptical but open-minded that DeSantis wants to do something serious about economic power.\"\n\nStoller added that he was more intrigued by DeSantis' decision to call for breaking up tech at an event so closely associated with Leonard Leo. \"If Leo buys that argument,\" Stoller said, \"then it means that a lot of federal judges might tip in that direction, too.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Leo declined to comment.\n\nTeneo's retreats are invite-only affairs limited to its members, their spouses and special guests. ProPublica and Documented obtained a video of DeSantis' remarks about big tech, which took place during a longer conversation between DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who is now running for president as a Republican.\n\nWatch Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Talk About Breaking Up Big Tech\n\nAs governor, DeSantis has repeatedly singled out tech and social-media companies, saying their actions \"may be one of the most pervasive threats to American self-government in the 21st century.\" Legislation he signed in May 2021 not only seeks to give Floridians the ability to sue tech companies and win monetary damages, it also empowers the state's attorney general to bring cases against tech companies under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. (Tech companies are challenging the law, and its fate remains unclear.)\n\nIn February of this year, DeSantis introduced a plan to create what he called a Digital Bill of Rights for Florida citizens. The proposal, billed as a way to protect privacy and eliminate \"unfair censorship,\" would ban TikTok on state government devices and block local and state employees \"from coordinating with Big Tech companies to censor protected speech.\"\n\nBut unlike some of his fellow conservatives, DeSantis' barbed public remarks about big tech have stopped short of urging the U.S. government to break up those tech companies. In his new book, \"The Courage to Be Free,\" he makes only a passing reference to \"enforcing antitrust laws\" against \"large corporations that are wielding what is effectively public power.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the Teneo Network retreat, DeSantis described tech companies as \"monopolies\" that \"have more power over our lives than the monopolies of the early 20th century ever had. And it's not even close.\" He listed tech companies' extensive data collection practices and their ability to shape \"core political speech\" as evidence of big tech's monopolistic powers.\n\nHe went on to say that tech platforms \"enforce their terms unevenly,\" adding that \"if you have a conservative viewpoint, you're much more likely to get censored, you're much more likely to get deplatformed.\"\n\nAnd in response to critics who might say it's not the role of government at any level to insert itself into the workings of a private business, DeSantis offered a sharp rebuttal. \"Protecting the rights of folks to participate in political speech, I think, is an absolutely appropriate role of government,\" he said. \"And I think that we should do all that we can.\"\n\nRead More\n\nWhen pressed by Ramaswamy onstage about using government power to shrink big tech companies, DeSantis stood by his position. \"Those big companies are basically an arm of the ruling regime,\" he said. \"Yeah, that should be something that should be done.\" And when asked if he feared that breaking up U.S. companies would strengthen China's position in global markets, DeSantis appeared unbothered, saying that he believed antitrust action was still the correct course.\n\n\"These tech companies are ruining our country,\" he said. \"They're a very negative influence. You need to be strong about it. And so that would not be the biggest concern I would have. My concern would be not having massive concentrations of power that are capable of silencing dissent, enforcing an orthodoxy and obviously interfering in elections, which we saw they did in 2020.\"\n\nDo you have information about Leonard Leo or the Teneo Network that we should know?

      "text": "Muzzled by DeSantis, Critical Race Theory Professors Cancel Courses or Modify Their Teaching\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nJonathan Cox faced an agonizing decision. He was scheduled to teach two classes this past fall at the University of Central Florida that would explore colorblind racism, the concept that ostensibly race-neutral practices can have a discriminatory impact. The first, \"Race and Social Media,\" featured a unit on \"racial ideology and color-blindness.\" The second, \"Race and Ethnicity,\" included a reading on \"the myth of a color-blind society.\" An assistant sociology professor, Cox had taught both courses before; they typically drew 35 to 40 undergraduates apiece.\n\nAs recently as August 2021, Cox had doubted that the controversy over critical race theory - which posits, among other things, that racism is ingrained in America's laws and power structure - would hamstring his teaching. Asked on a podcast what instructors would do if, as anticipated, Florida restricted the teaching of CRT in higher education, he said that they would need to avoid certain buzzwords. \"What many of us are looking at doing is just maybe shifting some of the language that we're using.\"\n\nBut a clash with state law seemed inevitable, once Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, proposed what he called the strongest legislation in the nation against \" the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory .\" Last April, DeSantis signed the Individual Freedom Act, also known as the \"Stop Woke Act,\" into law. It bans teaching that one race or gender is morally superior to another and prohibits teachers from making students feel guilty for past discrimination by members of their race. And it specifically bars portraying racial colorblindness - which the law labels a virtue - as racist. A DeSantis spokesperson, Jeremy Redfern, told me in an email that the law \" protects the open exchange of ideas\" (italics in the original) by prohibiting teachers from \"forcing discriminatory concepts on students.\"\n\nWhatever one thinks of critical race theory, the state's interference limits the freedom of professors who are experts in their fields to decide what to teach their students. Cox worried, not without reason, that the law effectively banned him from discussing his ideas in class, and that teaching the courses could cost him his livelihood. Cox, who is the only Black professor in the sociology department, will not be considered for tenure until this fall. His salary was his family's only income while his wife stayed home with their baby.\n\nA month before the fall 2022 semester was set to start, he scrapped both courses. Students scrambled to register for other classes. \"It didn't seem like it was worth the risk,\" said Cox, who taught a graduate course on inequality and education instead. \"I'm completely unprotected.\" He added, \"Somebody who's not even in the class could come after me. Somebody sees the course catalog, complains to a legislator - next thing I know, I'm out of a job.\"\n\nCox's decision, along with another professor's cancellation of a graduate course because of similar apprehension, created an unusual gap in the sociology curriculum at UCF, which, with almost 69,000 students, is Florida's largest university.\n\nCox's department chair, Elizabeth Mustaine, said she went along with the professors' wishes because \"I thought: 'I'm not going to stress anyone out about this. It's crazy.'\" Still, she added, \"it's an absolute tragedy that classes like this get canceled.\" Of the 39 courses offered this past fall by a department that specializes in the study of human society, none focused primarily on race.\n\nIn just over two years, critical race theory has gone from a largely obscure academic subject to a favorite bogeyman for Republican candidates. Activists such as Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, conceived of targeting CRT to foment a backlash against measures enacted following George Floyd's murder in May 2020. At that time, Rufo told me in an email, \"school districts across the country suddenly started adopting 'equity statements,' hiring 'diversity and inclusion' bureaucrats, and injecting heavily partisan political content into the curriculum.\" Black Lives Matter and the left were riding high, said Rufo, who denies that structural racism exists in America. In our email exchange, Rufo described \"the fight against critical race theory\" as \"the most successful counterattack against BLM as a political movement. We shifted the terrain and fought on a vector the Left could not successfully mobilize against.\"\n\nThe anti-CRT campaign quickly expanded from sloganeering to writing laws. Seven states, including Florida, have passed legislation aimed at restricting public colleges' teaching or training related to critical race theory. Those laws face impediments. On Nov. 17, 2022, a federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of the higher-education provisions of Florida's Individual Freedom Act. \"The First Amendment does not permit the State of Florida to muzzle its university professors, impose its own orthodoxy of viewpoints, and cast us all into the dark,\" Judge Mark Walker wrote . The DeSantis administration filed a notice of appeal on Nov. 29 and is seeking to stay the injunction pending that appeal. The 11th Circuit, where most of the judges are Republican appointees, will hear the appeal, with briefs to be filed in the next few months and oral arguments potentially this coming summer.\n\nAdditionally, with DeSantis' landslide reelection - after a campaign in which he repeatedly denounced \"woke\" education - and Republicans gaining a supermajority in both chambers of the state's Legislature, they are likely to look for new ways to crack down on CRT and what they perceive as higher education's leftist tilt. And at the federal level, conservatives are drafting a \"potential suite of executive orders in 2024,\" in case the next presidential election goes their way, to \"disrupt the national network of left-wing ideological production and distribution,\" according to Rufo.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss the conservative crusade against critical race theory as political theater without real consequences. But most colleges and universities offer social science and humanities courses that address racial inequality and systemic racism, and the anti-CRT laws are already having repercussions for people who teach or take these classes in red states. Moreover, the push against CRT is hitting academia after decades of declines in the proportion of professors protected by tenure, meaning that most faculty members are not in positions secure enough to resist political pressure. Now, forced to consider whether they face any legal or career risk, some are canceling courses or watering down content, keeping quiet rather than sharing their expertise with students.\n\n\"When you implement a law like this, you're asking professors to leave out things that clearly happen or have happened in the past,\" Grace Castelin, a UCF undergraduate who plans to introduce a resolution in the student senate condemning the law, told me. \"It's making us more ignorant in this generation and generations to come.\"\n\nFearful that legislators will retaliate by cutting their budgets, few top university administrators have publicly criticized the laws, which put institutions as well as individual teachers at risk. Indeed, UCF Provost Michael Johnson told faculty last July that the university would \" have to take disciplinary action \" against any faculty member who repeatedly violated the Individual Freedom Act because it couldn't afford to lose a \"catastrophic amount\" - $32 million - in state funding linked to graduation rates and other metrics. (Johnson declined an interview request.)\n\nOther states have left professors similarly undefended. In Tennessee, which passed a law much like Florida's, the provost of the state university's flagship Knoxville campus made clear to professors that the administration wouldn't necessarily help them. If they were sued under the law, Provost John Zomchick told faculty, Tennessee's Republican attorney general would decide whether the university would represent them in court. \"People freaked out,\" said Anne Langendorfer, a senior lecturer at UT Knoxville and the president of a union for campus workers at the state's public universities.\n\nA university spokesperson, Kerry Gardner, said that the attorney general makes the final decision in \"any situation\" where individuals are sued in their capacity as university employees. Administrators \"wanted to be fully transparent about how the process works,\" while assuring faculty that \"we will take every step to defend them,\" Gardner said. Zomchick, she added, \"does not agree with the view of some faculty\" that the law \"infringes on the First Amendment or academic freedoms.\"\n\nWith uncertain support from above, most full and associate professors at least enjoy the protection of tenure, which shields scholars whose insights or research are politically unpopular. Tenured professors can't be fired without cause and a hearing by their peers. Other faculty typically work on contracts, which the university can decide not to renew without specifying a reason.\n\nSome tenured professors in Florida have resisted anti-CRT pressure. The historian Robert Cassanello, the president of the UCF chapter of United Faculty of Florida, was comfortable becoming a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits contending that the Individual Freedom Act violates free speech. Cassanello, who keeps a life-size cutout of Karl Marx in his office window, told me that he's less threatened by the law than his untenured colleagues are.\n\nBy contrast, Juan Salinas, an assistant sociology professor at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, declined to be a plaintiff. \"For me to stick my name out, I didn't feel comfortable,\" Salinas said. \"If I had tenure, I would be more active.\"\n\nBut even having tenure didn't feel like \"adequate protection\" to Scott Carter, the other UCF sociologist who scrapped a course on race in the fall semester. \"It's very sad for students,\" Carter told me. \"They won't get the experience of hearing from scholars on contemporary race relations.\"\n\nPerhaps the surest indication that tenure helps safeguard critical race theory and other controversial curricula is that conservatives are trying to jettison it. In 2021, Georgia's public-university system made firing tenured faculty easier . After the University of Texas' faculty council adopted a resolution last February supporting professors' right to teach critical race theory , Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called for abolishing tenure for new hires at the state's public universities. Last April, DeSantis signed a bill authorizing reviews of tenured professors every five years.\n\nThe tenure divide has a racial dimension. At many state universities, tenured faculty are overwhelmingly white. Untenured faculty are more likely to be people of color. In the fall of 2018, 7.4% of full professors and 10.9% of associate professors - the two ranks most likely to be tenured - were Black or Hispanic , compared with 11.8% of assistant professors and 17% of instructors, lecturers and others, according to the American Association of University Professors. Women are also disproportionately concentrated in untenured positions.\n\nBesides having less job security than their tenured colleagues, many untenured faculty have less say in which courses they teach. One visiting assistant professor of sociology at an Oklahoma university, who requested anonymity to speak about her workplace, specializes in gender research; her dissertation was on urban women's experiences with menstrual practices in Kathmandu, Nepal. She wasn't familiar with critical race theory. But after Oklahoma in 2021 banned \"any orientation or requirement\" in higher education \"that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a bias on the basis of race and sex,\" she found herself assigned to teach a course on racial and ethnic relations.\n\n\"I have consistently seen this course taught by nontenured professors,\" she told me. \"That's been the trend,\" perhaps because of \"tenured professors not wanting to do the dirty work.\"\n\nUniversities themselves helped create the vulnerability that conservatives are exploiting, saving money - and, in the case of public institutions, offsetting budget cuts - by shifting to a less tenured teaching force. Tenured professors have declined from 39% of faculty in 1987, the earliest year for which comparable figures were available, to 24% in 2020 , according to an AAUP analysis of federal data. There has been a corresponding increase in the proportion of what are known as contingent faculty, who aren't tenured or on a path to it - instructors, lecturers, teaching faculty who don't do research and adjuncts - from 47% in 1987 to 67% in 2020. The remaining 9% are tenure-track faculty like Cox. Two of Florida's youngest public universities - Florida Gulf Coast University and Florida Polytechnic University, which opened in 1997 and 2014, respectively - do not currently grant tenure at all.\n\nThis past fall, Florida Gulf Coast's social and behavioral sciences department offered one race-focused course, \"Race and Culture.\" The former FGCU sociologist Ted Thornhill had stirred conservative protests by teaching courses on \"Racism and Law Enforcement\" and \"White Racism,\" and by founding a Center for Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. Since Thornhill left in June 2022 for a tenure-track post in the Pacific Northwest, no one has been teaching those courses. (Another instructor is scheduled to teach \"Racism and Law Enforcement\" this summer.) The university refashioned the center to focus on \"the Study of Race, Gender, Ethnicity and Culture,\" dropping the word \"critical.\"\n\n\"I knew it had a short life expectancy,\" Thornhill told me.\n\nFGCU President Michael Martin said that the center was renamed not to appease conservatives but to encompass groups such as Latinos, Native Americans and Jews. Still, Martin acknowledged that academia has become \"overly politicized,\" and that Florida \"has been out in front of some of this.\"\n\nIn the past, when academic freedom was threatened, tenure proved to be one of its most effective defenses. During the McCarthy era, when tenured professors were accused of having Communist sympathies, \"their institutions had to go through the motions of a formal investigation,\" the historian Ellen Schrecker wrote in \"No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism & the Universities.\" \"Non-tenured teachers had no such rights.\" The Cornell physicist Philip Morrison, an ex-Communist who remained politically active, \"could not be quietly dropped from the faculty\" in the early 1950s, at the height of the Red Scare, because he had tenure, and he was eventually promoted to full professor.\n\nThe sociologist Shantel Buggs is hoping to become a rarity: a tenured Black woman in Florida State's College of Social Sciences and Public Policy. In 2021, the college had one tenured Black woman. Overall, it had two tenured Black faculty and 59 white faculty .\n\nThe daughter of two Marines, Buggs was the first college graduate in her family. She has won teaching awards, published book chapters and articles in refereed journals, developed new courses and helped establish an anti-racism task force on campus. When UCF offered her a tenured associate professorship in 2021, Florida State gave her a raise to stay.\n\n\"Your work is powerful, timely, and extremely socially relevant, and you have quickly gained national recognition in your areas of expertise,\" Buggs' department chair at Florida State, Kathryn Tillman, wrote in 2021. Tillman also called her a \"fantastic teacher and mentor.\"\n\nAs the Individual Freedom legislation was being enacted, Buggs detected a subtle recalibration of her prospects. In April 2022, Buggs told me, Tillman urged her to take advantage of a COVID-19 extension and delay her candidacy for tenure by a year. Buggs protested. \"I thought it was unfair that I be asked to wait to go up for promotion in this political climate because what I teach and what I research will place a target on me,\" she said. But she agreed, she said, after Tillman expressed concern that higher-ups might deem her publication record insufficient for tenure. (Tillman told me via email that she can't comment on personnel issues.)\n\nOne course that Buggs had developed and taught was \"Critical Race Theory.\" She last offered it in the spring of 2021. The following September, she learned that it was the only Florida State course listed on the Critical Race Training in Education website, which has been featured on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" and describes CRT as a \"radical ideology\" that challenges \"the very foundations\" of American democracy. Buggs discovered that the website was a project of something called the Legal Insurrection Foundation.\n\nThe term \"insurrection\" alarmed her. Anxious that she might be trolled or harassed, Buggs was receptive in May 2022 to another Tillman request - to change the name of the course. Tillman told me that she and Buggs had discussed whether another title would help avoid \"potential misperceptions about the course's intent. Together, we agreed to give it a try.\" The course, which Buggs plans to teach in the upcoming semester, was relisted as \"Sociology of Race and Ethnicity.\"\n\nThe purpose of the Critical Race Training in Education website is to \"document what students can expect at a particular campus,\" according to William Jacobson, a Cornell University law professor and the president of the Legal Insurrection Foundation. Jacobson told me that, because he had criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, Cornell alumni petitioned to have him fired, a faculty statement denounced him and a student group called for boycotting his courses. \"Considering what I have gone through, I am very sympathetic to left-leaning faculty who come under attack, but it also is clear that the overwhelming campus cancel culture is from the left towards the right, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nA Florida State spokesperson told me critical race theory scholars should have no concern that their specialty will hurt their tenure chances. But Katrinell Davis, the director of the university's African American Studies program and the only tenured Black woman in the college of social sciences, says she is \"saddened\" by Buggs' predicament. \"Her trajectory as a scholar may be impacted\" by the Individual Freedom Act \"and because of the doubts that might arise around the value of CRT,\" Davis told me.\n\nFor her part, Buggs said she is open to leaving Florida for another state where she can teach critical race theory without legal consequences, but she doesn't want to. \"I have enjoyed working here,\" she told me. \"I'm a stubborn person. I don't want to give DeSantis the satisfaction.\"\n\nBuggs also worries that the political climate is rubbing off on students. In the past year or two, Buggs said, some students have begun to \"ding\" her in evaluations as judgmental or biased. Last spring, one called her a \"misandrist\" - a man-hater. \"Part of what pissed me off is, he got an A,\" she said. She has added a disclaimer provided by the faculty union to her syllabi: \"No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint, or belief.\"\n\nOther untenured teachers at Florida State are tweaking their pedagogy. When the doctoral candidate Taylor Darks taught a section of Buggs' \"Race and Minority Group Relations\" course this past fall, she invited students to suggest questions for discussion - but told me that she generally weeded out queries that mentioned \"white privilege.\" And Tyler McCreary, an assistant geography professor, made what he calls a \"strategic adjustment\" in his fall 2022 honors course on environmental justice. For a class project on a pipeline in northern Canada that affects Indigenous people, McCreary told me he's been \"much more cautious of not just critiquing the development but making sure to include the company's perspective.\"\n\nMcCreary, who is up for tenure this year, has also shifted his teaching method from lecturing to class discussion. He wants to avoid complaints under another new Florida law that allows students to record professors' lectures for evidence of political bias. The law doesn't apply to class discussion, because students must consent to be recorded.\n\nParked one October afternoon on the Florida State campus was a minibus covered in graffiti of various political persuasions. One commentator had scrawled \"Socialism Sucks,\" only to have another cross out \"Sucks\" and replace it with \"Is Sexy.\" Outside, a field rep for Turning Point USA, a conservative campus network, invited passersby to a speech by the group's founder, the talk show host Charlie Kirk. Turning Point USA, which has spent millions of dollars through its advocacy and political arms backing Donald Trump and candidates he endorsed, has what it calls a \"watchlist\" dedicated to \"unmasking radical professors.\"\n\nThe minibus was intended to signify Kirk's opposition to censorship. But when I asked him at his talk that night in Tallahassee's civic center whether he supports laws restricting the teaching of critical race theory, he said he does, and that it's not a free-speech issue. \"It's a matter of curriculum, right?\" he said. \"Should we teach the flat-Earth theory in physics, right? Should we teach bloodletting in biology? ... There are some ideas that are so reprehensible and provably wrong, they shouldn't be anywhere close to an academic environment.\" (Kirk bridles at the very notion of systemic racism: In his talk, he referred to the aftermath of George Floyd's death as \"Floydapalooza, when we decided to destroy our entire country around a lie that America is systemically racist, which of course we're not; we're the least racist country ever to exist in the history of the world.\")\n\nKirk's denial of systemic racism is at odds with the experience of students half a mile away, across the railroad tracks, at the public, historically Black Florida A&M University. Founded in 1887, and located since 1891 on a former plantation, FAMU has long been slighted by the state. When Nathan B. Young, the school's president from 1901 to 1923, supplemented its agricultural and vocational programs with liberal arts, state officials feared that too much learning might make Black students dissatisfied with manual labor, and dismissed him. After World War II, hoping to avoid desegregating white law schools, Florida opened a law school at FAMU. In 1966, the state prohibited FAMU from enrolling a new law school class and transferred funding to Florida State, which wanted its own law school. FAMU's law school reopened in 2002 in Orlando, where it wouldn't compete with Florida State's.\n\nThis past September, a group of FAMU students sued the state of Florida , accusing it of discriminating by underfunding FAMU compared with traditionally white schools. Among the disparities cited: In 2015, the state moved the almost $13 million budget for a joint FAMU-Florida State engineering college from FAMU's general operating revenues to a separate line under Florida State's authority. (A Florida State spokesperson said that presidents of both universities had agreed to the shift.) Also, the lawsuit says, linking funding to measures such as four-year graduation rates hurts FAMU and other universities that primarily serve low-income students.\n\nIn November, the state moved to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that the benchmarks used to determine funding are \"wholly neutral,\" and that the goal is to \"reward institutions who have better student outcomes,\" not to \"diminish the performance of historically black institutions.\"\n\nIn contrast to Florida State's lush, impeccably maintained campus, FAMU's shows signs of neglect, including cracked walkways and rusted pipes. Interviewed on campus, plaintiffs in the lawsuit described more indignities: beds with broken frames, a dormitory infested with rats and cockroaches, computers so old that current professors had used them when they were undergraduates.\n\nOne of those plaintiffs, FayeRachel Peterson, a first-year graduate student in chemistry, told me that some of the labs she worked in as a FAMU undergraduate lacked vital equipment. She and her classmates frequently had to finish their lab work at Florida State. \"FAMU tries its best to give us what it can with what's given to them,\" she said. \"What's given to them is less than what's given to others.\"\n\nAnother student, Nyabi Stevens, a third-year psychology major, told me that the state's treatment of FAMU illustrates the importance of discussions that the Individual Freedom Act is trying to silence. \"That's what the lawsuit is about - pointing out the systemic racism we see,\" she said. \"I came to an HBCU so I can learn about my history. I am very proud to be in the lawsuit and be a voice for people who don't have a voice.\"\n\nUCF students who wanted to learn about critical race theory this past fall had few options. Not only had the three sociology courses been canceled, but an anthropology course on racism was nixed because not enough students signed up for it.\n\nOne course that did survive has \"flown under the radar,\" Christian Ravela, an associate humanities professor, told me. His 18 students learned \"how colorblindness has become the dominant racial ideology\" and examined the anti-CRT movement, including the Individual Freedom Act, he said. Ravela received tenure in 2022. If he hadn't, \"I would have been most likely to just request to cancel the course.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThe preliminary injunction against the Individual Freedom Act pleased untenured faculty who teach critical race theory, but it hardly allayed their concerns. \"There is still an ongoing battle,\" Jonathan Cox, the UCF professor, told me. \"It seems just as likely that if a more conservative appeals judge reviews this, they will simply reinstate the law. Regardless, DeSantis and his conservative majority in the Florida Legislature will probably continue working to keep this law and others in place.\"\n\nAfter canceling his two fall courses on race, Cox has committed to teaching \"Race and Ethnicity\" in the semester that's about to begin. His wife has returned to work, so the family could get by on her income if he were to lose his job. Beyond that, he said: \"I just decided, 'I'm not going to run from it.' This is what I teach. This is what I study. There's tremendous value in students learning about these things.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

      "text": "A Florida-Sized Roadblock for the League of Women Voters\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThe nonpartisan League of Women Voters has been facing a nationwide backlash after decades of going about its business of surveying candidates, registering voters, hosting debates and lobbying for its causes with little fuss.\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica reported in August how the volatile political climate has caught up with the league, with conservatives increasingly portraying it as a decidedly liberal entity. Since that story was published, we've seen candidates reject invitations to debate and try to undermine the league's work in registering new voters. In September in Illinois, then-Lake County Board member Dick Barr, a Republican, publicly apologized for a Facebook post in which he called the league \"partisan hags.\"\n\nThis week, the group found itself once again in the middle of a political controversy. This time it was in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis has sought to reshape a wide range of discourse, including by making it easier for public officials to sue for defamation and restricting discussions of systemic racism in workplace trainings . The league revealed that it had been denied permission by the Florida Department of Management Services to hold an outdoor rally on the steps of the Old Capitol in Tallahassee under a new DeSantis administration rule requiring groups to first get sponsorship from a sympathetic state agency.\n\nThe rule took effect March 1 and says the requested use of the space must be \"consistent with the Agency's official purposes.\" Its stated purpose is to ensure that demonstrations are \"conducted in a manner that protects public health and safety and ensures that state employees and officials can fulfill their responsibilities.\"\n\nA department spokesperson did not answer specific questions about the matter, saying in an email to ProPublica: \"DMS routinely examines all of its rules in accordance with Florida Law. This rule was updated as part of the DMS annual regulatory plan to clarify procedures and requirements for public use of the Capitol.\"\n\nCapitalizing on a loophole that allows for news conferences, the league on Wednesday set up a podium in a nearby plaza , where it publicly addressed what it sees as the state's crackdown on civil rights, including free speech. At one point, league members applied red tape over their mouths, symbolizing what they say is the muzzling of people whose opinions are at odds with the government. (DeSantis' office did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nProPublica talked to the league's Florida president, attorney Cecile Scoon, about the increasingly difficult environment the 103-year-old group faces in Florida in trying to promote civic discourse, freedom of academic thought and ready access to the ballot box. Scoon called the rule limiting rallies a \"radical change\" and said she is aware that some First Amendment groups are considering litigation. The league is already embroiled in an ongoing suit against the DeSantis administration over a 2021 voting law . A federal judge struck down several provisions that he ruled were designed to discriminate against Black people to reduce turnout for Democrats. The state has appealed.\n\nThe conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWe have a lot of new members, and we want to expose them to all the different tools that we have - holding up signs and getting excited and being informed by my statements as president and our allies. That's what we like to do.\n\nWe were told the rally space was already taken up. And then we asked for any other space and we were told that we had to get an agency to sponsor the paperwork and basically authenticate whatever we were trying to do, and our statement needed to be in accord with that agency's policies. And that didn't make any sense because sometimes you want to complain about the government itself, you want to say, \"Hey you can do better here, please consider this and that.\"\n\nIt's hard to judge what's in their minds. But when you say you've got to get permission from a state agency and we've been known to criticize and sue the governor and state agencies, you have to think that they were looking at us and other like-minded civic groups. You have to believe that. Because why would they require you to get someone to agree with you first?\n\nOh, it's very damaging. The league doesn't expect everybody to agree with us. We are very capable and open and welcome debate and different points of view. That is not a problem. Let the citizens make up their minds of what they want to do and believe and who they want to vote for, but when you also take books off library shelves, when you also threaten teachers if they want to have academic freedom - K-12 and now the universities - that looks a lot like some of the other governmental regimes that wanted to stop the citizens from even being informed about what is going on.\n\nWe got a lot of positive feedback from all sides. We're going to have additional community conversations. We, again, are not going to be silenced. We're not going to be muzzled. We're going to create opportunities. We are continuing to double down on our outreach with many organizations that want more free speech and support these foundational American values. This morning nine of my members attended a conference and prayer breakfast set up by Pastors for Florida Children. ... There were representatives from the Islamic faith, Christian representatives of different denominations, there were Jewish representatives there and many civic organizations. And we all plan to work together to make sure everybody feels safe and everybody can be heard. People are outraged, they're upset and they just want fundamental American values returned to us. So it's not just voting rights organizations.\n\nIt involves very similar treatment, basically, with regards to what a lot of organizations are saying - \"You don't have a right to say X or Y in your classrooms , you don't have a right to have these books in your library for anybody.\" So there's a lot of consternation and a lot of fear.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter covering issues in Wisconsin and throughout the Midwest.\n\nI'm interested in tips about public corruption, corporate mismanagement or institutional failures that have harmed people in Wisconsin.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Florida Governor Signs Law Reforming Program for Brain-Damaged Infants\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Miami Herald . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed legislation overhauling a controversial state program that provides lifelong care for children born with catastrophic brain damage, approving the most far-reaching reform in the program's 33-year history.\n\nWith DeSantis' signature Monday night, parents who participate in the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Association, or NICA, will get an immediate $150,000 cash benefit and the pledge of Florida lawmakers that they will no longer have to fight with administrators for wheelchairs, medication, therapy and other services for their severely disabled children.\n\nThat's on top of the $100,000 the law previously provided, which had not been increased since the program's inception. Families said that original amount fell far short of providing for a severely disabled child.\n\nThe law, which takes effect immediately, follows an investigation by the Miami Herald , in conjunction with the investigative newsroom ProPublica, that found NICA had generated nearly $1.5 billion in assets - largely through the investment of assessments paid by doctors and hospitals. At the same time, families complained, administrators frequently delayed or denied claims for medication, therapy, equipment and nursing services to parents struggling to pay their bills.\n\nThe legislation is, in many ways, a rebuke of NICA's leadership, which had for decades run the program with little transparency. Parents said the program denied claims and made it difficult for them to access care for their children with severe and permanent brain damage. In one 2013 email obtained by the Herald , NICA's director wrote that the program was \"not here or funded to 'promote the best interest' of the children.\"\n\nThe new law, passed unanimously by both chambers of the Legislature, says otherwise: One provision requires that \"the association shall administer the plan in a manner that promotes and protects the health and best interests of children with birth-related neurological injuries.\"\n\nParents and guardians of children in NICA said they were glad to see the governor approve the changes, but some also wondered why it took years for the state to address the program's inadequacies.\n\n\"It feels good to be acknowledged, not just acknowledged but that they're trying to make things right,\" said Jennifer Pham, whose younger brother, Justin Nguyen, was accepted into NICA in 1998.\n\nPham, whose family's story was reported by the Herald, said her family had reached the point of desperation after years of fighting with program administrators to get what Justin had been promised.\n\n\"Why do families have to go through so much to get change?\" said Pham, 31, whose family lives in Jacksonville. \"I feel like anytime anything good happened with NICA was because my family was at the edge. We were at rock bottom, and then they wanted to help out.\"\n\nNICA administrators said in a prepared statement that the organization \"wholeheartedly supports and appreciates\" the legislative reforms.\n\n\"We are eager to provide these new benefits and have already begun implementing the new language and protocols envisioned in the legislation,\" administrators said, noting that the program recently launched a revamped website and updated the benefits handbook. \"Our 17-person team is committed to meeting all statutory deadlines and will do everything we can to give NICA families the support they need in navigating the claims process.\"\n\nFor most of its history, NICA operated in obscurity. Lawmakers created the program to manage the care of children born with severe physical and cognitive disabilities as the result of oxygen deprivation or spinal cord injury at birth.\n\nFamilies were steered into the program by a 1988 law - one of only two in the nation - that severely restricts the parents of certain brain-damaged children from suing their obstetrician or the hospital where their child was born. NICA was created to protect obstetricians from ruinous legal judgments for some of the most expensive medical mistakes, thereby lowering malpractice liability insurance premiums.\n\nParents said they were often treated with indifference and contempt by administrators who, they believe, cared more about their investment portfolios than the lives of frail and disabled children. Administrators hired a private investigator to tail one boy's parents after they appealed NICA's refusal to pay for therapy.\n\nYamile \"Jamie\" Acebo of Pembroke Pines - whose hardship was detailed in a Herald story - said the help her daughter, Jasmine, received from NICA often was delivered grudgingly, and late, if at all.\n\n\"They were just trying to nickel-and-dime me,\" Acebo said of her experience with NICA. \"It's like it was their savings account - like it was theirs and they were not really doing anything to help people.\"\n\nBut Acebo said she's happy that future NICA families will get more freely what she had to fight for. \"Finally something is going to get done,\" said Acebo. \"They are finally going to do the right thing. A lot of these families are struggling and should not have to struggle.\"\n\nAmong other provisions, the new law will give families the means to fully cover funeral and burial expenses if a child in NICA dies. Acebo said she couldn't afford both a coffin and funeral when 27-year-old Jasmine died in 2017. She said she had had to cremate her daughter, though her faith frowns upon the practice. \"Let me tell you,\" she said, \"I had to scrape and scrounge, and people had to give me money for my daughter's funeral.\"\n\nWith DeSantis' signature, \"on top of grieving a child, they won't have to worry, 'Where am I going to get money to bury my child?'\" Acebo said of parents still in the program. Because her involvement in NICA ended with the death of her daughter, Acebo will not receive the added $150,000. But she will receive an enhanced death benefit, $50,000 for death expenses, not the $10,000 the law previously allowed.\n\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, whose agency oversees NICA, said in a prepared statement Monday night that the legislation \"fundamentally reforms\" the program.\n\n\"This law represents a major paradigm shift,\" Patronis said. \"As of now, NICA must be fully engaged in the overall well-being of these families and children. Overall, these families are going to get more relief, and it is our job to ensure the board is holding NICA accountable and seeing these reforms are implemented.\"\n\nIn addition to the increase in the one-time payment and the extra allotment for parents of deceased children, the law provides:\n\nIn a prepared statement, one of its legislative sponsors said the law \"will help ensure so many struggling families get the help and care they deserve.\"\n\nRead More\n\n\"As a mother of two, I know there is nothing more important than ensuring your child has the proper care they need to live a long healthy life,\" said state Rep. Traci Koster, a Safety Harbor Republican and the law's House sponsor. \"This legislation brings needed changes to the NICA program and improves services that they provide.\"\n\nSen. Lauren Book, a Plantation Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation in the upper chamber, said, \"No family should have to beg for the treatment and supplies their children need while a quasi-governmental agency puts up roadblock after roadblock.\"\n\nSen. Danny Burgess, a Zephyrhills Republican who also co-sponsored the legislation, said: \"On behalf of all of the NICA families who have struggled, this is a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

So we did our own analysis and found only a very small percentage of them will be able to cast ballots this election. Some could face prosecution if they do.\n\nby Lawrence Mower and Langston Taylor , Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times\n\nThis article is part of Electionland , ProPublica's collaborative reporting project covering problems that prevent eligible voters from casting their ballots during the 2020 elections. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald, which share a state capital bureau in Tallahassee.\n\nNearly two years after Florida voters approved a landmark constitutional amendment allowing felons to vote, state officials don't know how many have registered. They also don't know how many felons on the voter rolls owe court fees, fines or restitution that would disqualify them from voting under a subsequent state law that limited the amendment's scope.\n\nFlorida officials have not removed any felons from the rolls for owing fines or fees, and they're unlikely to do so before Election Day, Secretary of State Laurel Lee said in an interview Monday. It's unclear whether those whom the state fails to prune are entitled to vote after all - or may face prosecution if they do.\n\nWith so much in flux, the winner in Florida of the closely watched presidential vote could be decided by the courts for the second time in two decades.\n\nAmid the confusion, the one certainty is that Florida's Republican governor and Legislature have tamped down the felon vote, according to an analysis of state records by the Tampa Bay Times, Miami Herald and ProPublica. In a presidential election marred by voter suppression tactics, such as misinformation about vote-by-mail fraud, the weakening of Florida's ballot measure, known as Amendment 4, may constitute the biggest single instance of voter disenfranchisement. Like the poll taxes of the Jim Crow era, the restrictions have especially hit Black Floridians, who make up a disproportionate share of felons and register overwhelmingly as Democrats.\n\nSign up to learn how to become a more informed, more engaged citizen.\n\nBy comparing the Florida Department of Corrections database of roughly 418,000 inmates released since 1997 with the state's August list of nearly 15 million registered voters, the analysis found that about 31,400 Floridians with felony convictions have registered to vote since Amendment 4 took effect in January 2019. More than twice as many have registered as Democrats than Republicans, and the amendment has had the greatest impact in counties with higher numbers of Black residents. In Gadsden County, the only one in the state where more than half of the residents are Black, felons made up at least 1 in 5 new voters. In seven other counties with sizable Black populations, felons make up at least 1 in every 15 new voters.\n\nBecause it excludes felons who didn't serve time in a Florida prison or were released before 1997, the 31,400 figure is likely an undercount. But it's not far below a more comprehensive tally by Georgetown University Law professor Neel Sukhatme. Using data he collected on 850,000 felons in Florida, he found that just 45,300 have registered over the same period, he said.\n\nOverall, both the Times/Herald/ProPublica and Georgetown analyses found that fewer than 8% of Florida's felons have registered to vote since Amendment 4 passed. That's a much lower rate, though over a shorter time frame, than in other states that have restored their voting rights. When Amendment 4 was adopted with widespread bipartisan support in 2018, some advocates predicted it would restore voting rights to as many as 1.4 million Floridians. They expected that between 10% and 20% of felons, or between 140,000 and 280,000, would register to vote in the 2020 election.\n\n\"Clearly it's not one fell swoop that many Amendment 4 backers hoped for,\" University of Florida political science professor Dan Smith said. \"But it's a movement in the right direction, and it has taken every effort, in spite of Republican leadership in Tallahassee, to get every one of those eligible citizens in Florida registered to vote.\"\n\nEven fewer are likely to cast ballots in November, however.\n\nOf the 45,300 felons Sukhatme identified on the voter rolls, 78% might owe fees, fines or restitution, he said. Because of the 2019 law requiring felons to pay off those debts before voting, they are legally on the rolls but may be ineligible to vote. \"It's a shame that despite what the people of Florida clearly voted for in the ballot initiative that this high percentage of folks are being prevented from exercising their constitutional rights,\" said Sukhatme, who established a free website, FreeOurVote.com , allowing felons to see if they are free of fines and fees.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, pushed state lawmakers last year to impose the fees and fines restriction, which disqualified nearly 800,000 felons from voting. DeSantis declined to comment through a spokesman.\n\nSome Republicans have said that a lower turnout would improve Trump's chances of reelection. In March, Trump criticized proposals for more funding of voting by mail, saying that they would produce \"levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n\nState Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican who helped write the law restricting Amendment 4's impact, said he had hoped that more people would register.\n\n\"I think engaged citizens are good for the republic,\" he said.\n\nBut he defended the law, saying legislators were simply following the language of Amendment 4, which required felons to complete \"all terms\" of their sentences before voting.\n\n\"'All terms' includes all terms,\" he said.\n\nThe battle over Amendment 4 has led celebrities and deep-pocketed Democrats, including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, to donate tens of millions of dollars toward paying off fines and fees to make felons eligible to vote. Bloomberg and his team claim they have identified 32,000 Black and Hispanic voters who are on the rolls but are ineligible to vote because they owe court fees or fines, according to The Washington Post .\n\nBloomberg's team has raised $16 million to cover debts for felons who owe less than $1,500. It believes that if the 32,000 felons could vote, they could swing the election, even in a state with nearly 15 million registered voters. So far, however, groups' efforts to pay fees and fines have not dramatically increased the rolls. Out of 325 people in Hillsborough County who have had their fines and fees paid off by the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, and whose records were made available, only 56 registered to vote, the Times/Herald/ProPublica analysis shows.\n\nThe addition of even a few thousand voters could tip the upcoming contest or plunge the state's results into chaos and the courts.\n\n\"If there is a wide swath of felons on the rolls who are ineligible to vote,\" Brandes said, \"that is likely to be something that is challenged.\"\n\nIn a swing state that could determine the next president, the uncertainty over felon voting is inexcusable, experts said.\n\n\"It's a tremendous failure,\" said Marc Meredith, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied voting trends among felons. \"This shouldn't happen.\"\n\nNext month's election will be a critical test for Amendment 4.\n\nIts passage marked the culmination of an 18-year effort by voting rights groups to eliminate a relic of systemic racism dating back to post-Civil War Florida. But months after voters approved the amendment, the Republican-led Legislature blunted its impact. The law, said Rosemary McCoy, is doing exactly what it was designed to do: prevent people like her from voting.\n\nMcCoy, 63, of Jacksonville, was released from prison in 2016 after serving seven months on theft and racketeering convictions. She helped gather enough signatures for Amendment 4 to appear on the ballot. After it passed, she used it to register to vote. But she won't be casting a ballot Nov. 3 because she owes more than $7,800 in restitution. She is one of 17 felons who sued the state and the governor last year over the restriction.\n\nIn May, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that the new law created an illegal \"pay-to-vote\" system. He concluded that most felons who owed court costs should be allowed to vote, opening the door for hundreds of thousands to register. About four months later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, led by five Trump-appointed judges, overturned Hinkle's decision. Their ruling is likely to stand through the Nov. 3 election.\n\nState election officials decided to wait for the litigation to play out before pruning any felons who owe money from the voter rolls, said Lee, a former judge who was appointed secretary of state by DeSantis last year, and who oversees the state Division of Elections. Because the 11th Circuit's decision came so late, she doesn't expect to remove any felons before the election, she said.\n\n\"The interpretation of what Amendment 4 meant for Florida voters has been altered several times throughout the course of the litigation,\" Lee said, \"and we did not want to initiate removal proceedings for any voter who could later be determined to be eligible.\"\n\nState officials have offered some guidance to county election supervisors and posted guidelines on its website for voting under Amendment 4. But they have done little outreach to the thousands of felons who are on the rolls but ineligible to vote. Lee said she granted the interview Monday, her first in-depth interview on Amendment 4 since the June 2019 lawsuit, to get the word out to felons.\n\n\"If a voter knows that they have not completed the terms of their sentence, they absolutely should not vote,\" she said.\n\nThe situation doesn't just jeopardize the state's election results. Felons who owe court fees, fines or restitution run the risk of committing a felony if they cast ballots next month. State law prohibits anyone from voting if they \"know\" they're ineligible.\n\nThat includes people like Steven Deane of New Port Richey, who registered to vote in June, after the federal judge overturned the Legislature's law.\n\nDeane, 33, who had been convicted on theft and fraud charges stemming from substance abuse, said regaining his right to vote was a pivotal moment in his life. After receiving his voter registration card in the mail this year, the first thing he did was show it to his mother.\n\nIn September, he got his driver's license back after paying about $3,000 in court fees.\n\nBut Deane still owes more than $10,000.\n\nNo state or local official notified him that he was ineligible to vote in the November election. He didn't learn that he couldn't cast a ballot until last month - when he was contacted by a reporter for this story.\n\n\"I should have known better,\" Deane said. \"This is Florida.\"\n\nUntil last year, the only way for felons to regain their right to vote in Florida was to go to Tallahassee and beg for mercy.\n\nFelons had been ineligible to vote since 1868, when lawmakers wrote the rule into the state Constitution. It was part of a slate of actions designed to remove Black voters from the rolls, including literacy tests, poll taxes and a requirement that voters prove their date of birth, an obstacle for freed slaves who usually didn't have birth certificates.\n\nBy 1880, Florida had gone from having a majority of Black voters to almost none at all, said Darryl Paulson, a former University of South Florida professor who has written extensively about the state's felon voting ban.\n\n\"It was like a catch-all net,\" Paulson said. \"If one of these barriers doesn't get you, the next will.\"\n\nMost of the other barriers were lifted during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. But Florida's lifetime ban on felon voting persisted, even as other states struck theirs down.\n\nUntil Amendment 4, Florida was one of four states - along with Virginia, Iowa and Kentucky - that required all felons to petition the governor to have their rights restored. Those wanting to vote again could make their case to the governor and the elected members of the Florida Cabinet, a sometimes-humiliating process in which felons could be asked intimate and arbitrary questions, such as how many children they had by how many mothers.\n\nThis article is part of Electionland, ProPublica's collaborative reporting project covering problems that prevent eligible voters from casting their ballots during the 2020 elections. Learn more\n\nIn 2007, then-Gov. Charlie Crist - a Republican at the time - changed the clemency rules to restore voting rights to more than 150,000 people. But the state's constitutional ban on felon voting remained, and in 2011, then-Gov. Rick Scott immediately reverted to the pre-Crist rules. Only about 3,000 people had their rights restored by Scott during his eight years in office.\n\nBy 2016, the estimated 1.4 million felons in Florida made up nearly a quarter of all disenfranchised felons in America, according to a report by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal justice reform.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 were Black, well above their 17% share of the state's population.\n\nThe following year, a group known as the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition gathered enough signatures to put Amendment 4 on the 2018 ballot. It restored the right to vote to nearly all felons \"after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation.\"\n\nThe amendment, crafted after years of polling, did not restore rights to anyone convicted of murder or sex offenses, and it said nothing about fines or fees. The omission was deliberate, according to Howard Simon, the former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, who helped write the amendment. Simon said its authors believed that such a provision might be unconstitutional, and they also didn't want to set a precedent by linking voting rights to financial status.\n\n\"If we had included it, it would have taken us another 150 years to get that pay-to-vote system out of the Florida Constitution,\" he said.\n\nHowever, during a hearing before the Florida Supreme Court, more than 18 months before Floridians voted on Amendment 4, an attorney for organizers told justices that \"all terms\" did include all court fees, fines and restitution. Then, after the ballot measure passed, the ACLU repeated the same point in letters to state officials.\n\nSeizing on those statements, Republican lawmakers proposed legislation interpreting \"all terms\" to include all financial obligations. When backers of Amendment 4 argued that it doesn't mention fines and fees, and that the Legislature did not need to act, the House sponsor of the bill, then-Rep. Jamie Grant, R-Tampa, accused them of hypocrisy and misleading voters.\n\nWhen lawmakers warned that the bill would exclude the vast majority of felons, Grant said he didn't care; he was interpreting Amendment 4 as its creators intended.\n\n\"I don't want to know the impact of this,\" Grant told lawmakers, \"because it's irrelevant.\" This year, DeSantis appointed Grant to be the state's chief information officer.\n\nRepublicans in the Florida Senate, led by Brandes, pushed for a version of the law that would have permitted felons to vote once a judge converted the debts to civil liens - a common practice once a felon is no longer imprisoned or on probation. That provision would be \"fairer to felons,\" Brandes said at the time. But Grant and his House counterparts won out, and Senate Republicans, including Brandes, approved the stricter version of the law.\n\nFlorida's Division of Elections, which is responsible for removing ineligible voters from the rolls, can't say definitively how many registered voters are convicted felons.\n\nDivision Director Maria Matthews told a federal judge this year that her office had flagged the names of 85,000 registered voters whose names and birthdates matched those of felons, a figure cited repeatedly by federal judges during the litigation. Overruling Matthews, state officials now say they do not consider that number accurate because it includes too many false matches.\n\nUntil her office reviews an individual's case, Lee said, she can't say for sure whether that person is a felon. She declined to give a current number of people flagged as felons. She noted that her office has removed 6,000 felons from the rolls who were ineligible to vote because they were convicted of murder or felony sex offenses. About 260 registered sex offenders and 1,200 felons on probation are still on the rolls, even though both groups are prohibited from voting, the Times/Herald/ProPublica analysis shows.\n\nThe Florida Rights Restoration Coalition estimates at least 50,000 felons have registered since January 2019, a slightly higher count than Sukhatme's, but the group has not said how it reached that figure.\n\nSmith, the University of Florida political science professor, has assembled the most comprehensive known database on Florida felons. But his data is owned by the ACLU of Florida, which did not permit him to release it. Smith told the Times/Herald/ProPublica that he did not consider the data completely accurate.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks they have a definitive number, including the state of Florida, are probably fooling themselves,\" Smith said.\n\nAll of the estimates, however, are well below what was anticipated when Amendment 4 passed, experts said.\n\nMeredith, the University of Pennsylvania professor, said the figures seemed \"quite low\" relative to what he would expect \"had the policy been running smoothly.\"\n\n\"My expectation would be that you would be seeing more than 50,000 or 60,000 voting, much less registering,\" he said.\n\nMeredith has looked into similar situations in other states. He found that in Iowa, about 29% of felons registered to vote. The proportions were even higher in Maine and Rhode Island, where 38% and 43% of convicted felons registered to vote, respectively. None of the three states required felons to pay all financial obligations before voting, and they attained these levels of felon participation over longer time periods than the less than two years since Amendment 4 took effect.\n\nA separate study by Harvard University doctoral candidate Michael Morse found that 20% of the roughly 150,000 felons who had their rights restored by Crist from 2007 to 2011 were registered to vote in 2012.\n\nExperts agreed that the law requiring payment before voting - and the confusion surrounding it - are a deterrent to felons who want to vote.\n\n\"It's not astonishing to me that we would see low rates of registration,\" said Ariel White, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied voting patterns among felons. \"This has been an extremely confusing situation for, it seems, everybody involved.\"\n\nBy adopting the strictest interpretation of Amendment 4, lawmakers created an \"administrative nightmare,\" Hinkle, the federal judge, said during a hearing last year. That's because Florida has no central database of court fees or fines. Data on felony convictions is scattered across the state's 67 county clerk's offices, and much of that information is incomplete or outdated. Nobody tracks restitution paid to victims.\n\nLee said her office has to request information on felons' fines and fees from clerks of court, who often have trouble coming up with the correct numbers. During the litigation, an official in the Hillsborough County clerk's office testified that he and four co-workers spent 12 to 15 hours figuring out how much one felon owed.\n\n\"This process is far more complex than our prior process, when we were reviewing simply to see if someone might have a prior felony,\" Lee said.\n\nNearly 80% of Florida's felons are estimated to owe money to the courts. Some owe criminal fines, which can range from $5,000 for a felony DUI to $500,000 for drug trafficking. The vast majority, however, owe \"user fees.\" In Florida, there's a $100 fee for using a public defender, a $50 fee for applying to use a public defender - even a $100 fee to cover the cost of prosecution - all tacked on at the end of the sentence.\n\n\"You're paying the state to prosecute you,\" said Lisa Foster, a former judge who is co-director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center, which advocates for the elimination of court fees.\n\nAre you a voter? A poll worker? An election administrator? We want to hear from you about any problems you're experiencing or witnessing in the voting process.\n\nWhile criminal fines have been around for centuries, user fees are a modern innovation, triggered by the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s, in addition to a bipartisan wave of anti-tax sentiment.\n\nWith more arrests came a need for more courthouses, judges, prosecutors and public defenders. Instead of raising taxes to fund this expansion of the criminal justice system, however, Florida, like other states, targeted \"users\" of the system - the people swept up in the nation's anti-crime wave.\n\nIn 1998, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing courts to charge defendants user fees. Today, those fees add hundreds of dollars to each felony conviction. Some of the fees don't go to the criminal justice system but are routed into the Legislature's general revenue fund that pays for services such as parks, roads and schools.\n\nIn Florida, about 3 out of every 4 people who face felony charges are too poor to afford their own lawyer. Nearly the same share of felons in Florida owe court fees or fines, according to Smith's analysis. About 90% of the dollars aren't expected to be paid, county clerk data shows.\n\nFailing to pay fees brings consequences aside from voting. Nearly 2 million Floridians have their driver's licenses suspended for failing to pay court fees or fines, according to the Fines and Fees Justice Center, locking them out from the estimated 30% of jobs that require driving. The amounts often go to debt collectors, meaning they could show up on background checks and credit reports, and they can prevent people from receiving occupational licenses.\n\nMarq Mitchell, 30, of Oakland Park in Broward County, lost his right to vote before he turned 18, after he was convicted as an adult of escaping from a juvenile detention facility. When he sought certification as a recovery peer specialist, to help people recover from substance abuse and mental health disorders, he found he couldn't be certified or pass a company's background check because of the more than $4,000 in decade-old court fees he couldn't afford to pay off.\n\nBecause he couldn't be certified, his nonprofit, Chainless Change, can't qualify for state or local contracts, he said.\n\n\"It's a debtor's prison,\" he said. \"If you're too poor, then you'll never be able to access a better quality of life.\"\n\nDesmond Meade, who leads the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said he believed a combination of uncertainty and apathy among Florida officials was also responsible for driving down the number of people with felony convictions registering to vote. Meade said the state, for example, did not publicize its process for allowing felons to request advisory opinions about how much they owe in court-ordered costs.\n\n\"You would expect the state to do things to encourage civic participation,\" Meade said. \"The state is just doing the bare minimum.\"\n\nBefore the Legislature imposed the fees and fines requirement, Meade said, he had anticipated that 250,000 felons would register to vote. Greg James, a Tallahassee pastor who helped push Amendment 4 over the finish line in 2018, said he and other organizers were hoping 140,000 people with felony convictions would register.\n\n\"Fear has set into a lot of minds of men and women who were thinking about registering,\" James said, noting that some people don't know if they owe money and worry that casting a ballot could result in new felony charges.\n\nThe addition of even a small number of voters to the rolls could alter the course of the November election in Florida.\n\nAny edge would most likely favor Democrats.\n\nAbout half of the 31,400 convicted felons on the voting rolls identified by the Times/Herald/ProPublica analysis are Black, and 52% overall registered as Democrats. Another 25% registered with no party affiliation. It's unclear how many of them have outstanding fines and fees.\n\nOnly 22% are registered Republicans, though 52% of white felons registered as Republicans, a greater rate than white Floridians overall (47%).\n\n\"These people are registering the way that Black and white registrants register in Florida, except that white individuals with felony convictions are even more likely to register with the Republican Party,\" Smith noted.\n\nIn raw numbers, about 16,200 of the 31,400 registered felons are Democrats, compared with 6,800 Republicans, a nearly 9,400-vote difference.\n\nThe latest polls between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden show that the race is neck-and-neck. Florida has a history of tight elections. The 2018 race for governor between DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum was decided by about 33,000 votes. Scott defeated Democrat Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate that year by just over 10,000 votes. Most notoriously, Florida's 2000 presidential election was decided by just 537 votes - and by a 5-4 decision in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThis time around, the state's failure to pare ineligible felons from the rolls could similarly throw the presidential race into the courts.\n\nLee's office is capable of processing only 57 voter registrations per day, meaning it would take until 2026 to screen the tens of thousands of people flagged as potential felons and remove those who owe fines and fees. Her office still needs funding for more workers to pore through the backlog, she said. She requested more than $1 million from the Legislature this year to hire more people to screen Amendment 4-related voters but did not receive it, her spokesman said.\n\nSix political observers, advocates, lawmakers and lawyers told the Times/Herald/ProPublica either party might exploit voting by ineligible felons to challenge the state's election results.\n\n\"I think people will use everything to cast doubt,\" said Tallahassee lawyer Barry Richard, who represented George W. Bush in the contentious 2000 Florida election recount. \"We're going to have lots of lawsuits.\"\n\nLawyers would need to prove there were enough ineligible felons who cast votes to swing the election, Richard said.\n\nAlso unclear is how much personal risk felons who owe fines and fees face if they vote.\n\nState law makes it a third-degree felony, with a sentence of up to five years in prison, for anyone to vote \"knowing he or she is not a qualified elector.\"\n\nHow the law would be enforced could depend on who is in charge in each county. Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren said the standard for proof is high - the equivalent of someone \"twirling their mustache and hatching a plan to pull a fast one on the State of Florida.\"\n\nBrevard County and Seminole County State Attorney Phil Archer, the president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said through a spokesman that so far he's received no guidance on the subject from the state's Division of Election or state Attorney General Ashley Moody.\n\nEven the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit was split on whether ineligible felons on the rolls can vote. In their September ruling, the six Republican-appointed judges wrote that the 85,000 people flagged as potential felons are \"entitled\" to vote because the state has yet to screen them.\n\nThe four Democratic-appointed judges in the minority noted that registered felons could be prosecuted for voting, and that even eligible felons on the rolls may choose not to vote to avoid being charged with a crime.\n\n\"Florida ignores this reality, and the majority is blind to it,\" they wrote.\n\nFor Ryan Aderholtz of Tampa, being convicted of a felony brought many unexpected hardships.\n\n\"You can't get hired anywhere. You can't get an apartment,\" said Aderholtz, 36, who was released from prison in 2009 after serving nine months for driving with a suspended license and fleeing a police officer. \"It affects your credit, buying houses, everything.\"\n\nAderholtz ultimately started his own business repairing screens on covered porches and verandas. While he considers himself successful, he said it wasn't until he regained his right to vote that he felt fully reintegrated into society.\n\n\"I felt like part of America again,\" Aderholtz said.\n\nFor countless other felons across Florida, that feeling has remained elusive.\n\nNancy Abudu, deputy legal director for voting rights at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, said she is advising anyone who is uncertain about whether they owe money to avoid voting next month. She said different prosecutors could handle the state's ineligible voting law differently, noting that Georgia's secretary of state vowed to investigate about 1,000 people who allegedly voted twice in elections this year.\n\n\"It's just a very sad state of affairs, one that could have been totally avoided,\" she said. \"Florida again, in a historic election, will be on the news for probably a total administrative meltdown.\"\n\nSheila Singleton, 58, of Jacksonville, voted in May last year, nine years after a felony conviction sent her to jail for six months. She was unaware that she owed anything on the case until a week after she cast her ballot, when the Duval County clerk notified her she owed nearly $15,000 in restitution and nearly $1,000 in court-ordered fees and fines - amounts she says she has no chance of paying back.\n\nShe makes $15 an hour registering and educating voters for New Florida Majority, which works to increase turnout among Floridians of color. Her job is set to end after the election.\n\n\"Nobody told me that when I pleaded guilty I wouldn't be able to vote, I wouldn't be able to get a job,\" she said.\n\nSingleton is disgusted that Republican lawmakers stripped away her ability to vote. Instead of risking prosecution for voting, all she can do now is encourage everyone else to vote, she said.\n\n\"It was not fair to us,\" she said. \"They have to cheat to win.\"\n\nAbout the Data : The Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald and ProPublica compared a Florida Department of Corrections database published Oct. 1, 2020, of about 418,000 inmates released since 1997 with the state's list of nearly 15 million active and inactive registered voters as of Aug. 31. The first names, last names and dates of birth from both databases were matched to identify more than 31,400 people incarcerated for felonies who have registered to vote since Jan. 8, 2019. About 50 records were not included because they matched multiple registered voters. Many of the estimated 1.4 million people with felony convictions in Florida did not serve time in Florida prisons, however. The state's 67 clerks of court are often the only source of data on their crimes.\n\nSophie Chou contributed reporting.\n\nAre you a voter? A poll worker? An election administrator?

      "text": "When a Florida Farmer-Legislator Turned Against Immigration, the Consequences Were Severe. But Not for Him.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nRick Roth is a staunch Republican and a conservative member of the Florida Legislature, but he's quick to point out that he's first and foremost a farmer. Roth grows vegetables, rice and sugar cane on the thousands of acres passed down to him from his father, in Palm Beach County south of Lake Okeechobee. And because the farm relies on a steady stream of laborers, most of them from Mexico, Roth spent substantial time over the last three decades, before and after he became a politician, trying to stop lawmakers from messing with his workforce.\n\nA big part of that fight was against legislation that would make employers verify their workers' immigration status. Such laws, Roth once said, would bankrupt farmers like him .\n\nBut by 2023, when Florida was once again considering such a bill, Roth's convictions had grown shaky. In May of that year, he sat and listened as his Democratic colleagues voiced their opposition: \"This bill will tank our state's economy by directly harming Florida's agriculture, hospitality and construction industries,\" one of them warned. Had this debate been unfolding even a few years earlier, Roth - who has acknowledged relying heavily on labor by undocumented immigrants in the past - likely would have nodded along.\n\nThis time, he didn't. Several minutes later, Roth, his gray hair cut short and a cross pinned to his lapel, rose from his seat on the House floor, peered through reading glasses and delivered a statement antithetical to what the 70-year-old had long stood for: \"I rise in support of SB 1718,\" he announced. First among his reasons, he said, was an \"invasion\" of immigrants at the border. He called it a \"ticking time bomb.\"\n\nThe bill not only required all but the smallest employers to check the legal status of any new hires against a federal database, it also ordered hospitals to ask patients about their status. The measure added new funds to Gov. Ron DeSantis' program to transport newly arrived immigrants out of the state, while making it a felony for individuals to bring undocumented workers in. DeSantis called it \"the strongest anti-illegal-immigration legislation in the country.\"\n\nRoth knew that the legislation might hurt many farmers - not to mention landscapers and contractors and hotels and a slew of other employers in Florida. But it was good politics. Across the country, Republican politicians like himself have almost universally fallen in line with what amounts to a requirement for party membership. Even business-focused Republicans, who for many years had turned a blind eye to undocumented immigrants because they provided cheap, reliable labor, had given in to a mandate from a party whose leader has spent three presidential campaigns portraying immigration as an existential threat to the United States. In Roth's case, the transformation from a decades-long advocate for expanding legal immigration to a Trump-style hardliner was so swift and so complete that he barely tries to explain it, other than to repeat what sound like Republican talking points about how the border has become a crisis.\n\nThe measure passed easily out of the Republican-controlled House the same day Roth stood to support it. Relieved it was over, he left Tallahassee to return to his fields outside the town of Belle Glade, where the motto is \"her soil is her fortune.\" He drove his Toyota Prius, a Trump 2020 sticker on the bumper, down the dirt lanes that run along his tracts of land. Birds darted around the fallow farmland. Roth felt at ease.\n\nThe calm didn't last. Among Roth's business owner constituents, there was a rising panic about the fate of their workers. A manager of a vegetable packing house stood by as dozens of his workers left. \"We had a mass exodus here,\" he later said. Undocumented immigrants and their families were loading up trucks with years of belongings and decamping to Georgia or North Carolina. \"Everyone was afraid,\" said a resident of a Belle Glade mobile home park. She'd watched as at least five of her neighbors, all undocumented immigrants, sold their trailers and moved. A daycare worker in the next town said several children of immigrants in her classroom were there one week, gone the next.\n\nAs workers were scrambling to protect themselves from what they saw as a coming crackdown, phone calls were flooding into Roth's legislative office. The farmers and contractors and landscapers were complaining that this law Roth had supported was going to wreck their businesses. It was exactly the kind of fallout Roth had long warned of when he'd fought measures like the one he'd just helped to pass.\n\nAs one nursery owner who called into Roth's office asked: \"What have you done?\"\n\nAround the time of the flurry of calls, 26-year-old Salvador Garcia Espitia and his wife, Nohemí Enriquez Fonseca, were trying to figure out how they'd deal with their own crisis. The couple, who'd grown up near each other in the small ranchos of the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, had become parents two years before. Their son, Isaac, had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and autism. Garcia's work in a vegetable packing facility and in the corn fields around their town barely covered his son's therapy and medication. Enriquez hadn't worked since the baby was born, since his care took all her time.\n\nThe family lived in Cerritos, with Garcia's parents. It wasn't much of a town, just a cluster of homes behind a locked gate. The gate went up after a local woman was kidnapped, presumably by gang or cartel members, though no one knows for sure. Each night, after 9:30, residents communicated by group chat if someone needed to leave for an emergency, so that whoever had the key could let them out and back in.\n\nWhenever Garcia worked overtime, which was almost always once Isaac's medical bills stacked up, his mother would sit and wait for him to come home, even until 2 a.m. She feared for her youngest child, her only son. He was so full of promise, capable of so much with his serious disposition and vast intelligence. She worried not just about his safety, but that she hadn't done enough for him. The best job she could find was cleaning houses, which she did for many years. Her husband was frequently out of work after a head injury he'd suffered back when Garcia was a toddler.\n\nSince Garcia was a child, he had watched countless relatives and friends make the decision for their own families' futures to go find work in the north. The men departed, crossing into the United States without papers. To have a home, to afford a car, to provide for a child who would struggle to walk or speak, going north was the only way.\n\nBut Garcia was clear: He would not cross the border that way. He could not risk being harmed or killed and leaving his wife and son with nothing.\n\nNot long after the severity of Isaac's condition came to light, Garcia began to listen more closely to other young men in the towns near his: There was a way to travel back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico for work, a way to do it that seemed safe.\n\nThe solution for Garcia was a visa program that promised to benefit both migrating workers in desperate need of livable wages and U.S. farms in desperate need of affordable labor. But in many ways, the benefits to workers have remained a gamble while for farmers they're guaranteed.\n\nRoth is a special case, a farmer and also a politician. For him, the program has served a dual purpose. It's ensured the success of his business by providing a steady stream of workers. And it's made it easier for him to adopt a harsher political stance on immigration at a time when he feels his party demands it.\n\nRoth didn't mention it on the House floor or broadcast it to his constituents, but the visa program made his farm mostly impervious to the provisions he'd rallied against in the past. As anxiety gripped communities of undocumented people and many of their employers, Roth Farms was going to be just fine.\n\nThe visa program turned out to be a lifeline for Roth. When Garcia reached for that same lifeline, it failed him.\n\nRoth Farms dates back four generations to the late 1940s, but Rick Roth didn't grow up thinking the family business would be his future. When he went off to Emory University in 1970 to study math, he figured he'd find himself working an office job, somewhere far from any fields.\n\n\"I thought, 'Man, I'm too smart to be a farmer.'\" But Roth said a mix of marijuana and malaise sent him off track. After he was placed on academic probation, he came home and asked his father to put him to work on the farm. To Roth's surprise, he liked it. He was assigned easy jobs, like driving truckloads of radishes to the packing house. Though he'd often mess up basic tasks or show up late and hungover, his father's workers knew that he could be the boss someday, and they treated him accordingly. Roth knew it, too. He also knew that if he went to work at some company, he'd start at the bottom, and there was no guarantee how far up he'd make it. Here, he had a clear path to the top.\n\nRoth returned to Emory, finished his degree, and then came back to Roth Farms. His father gave him more responsibility, and within a few years he was overseeing harvest operations. With his crew leaders' guidance, he'd earned his father's respect and sensed that this might be permanent, that the farm could actually be his.\n\nSooner than he expected, it was. In 1984, his father had a heart attack. Two years later, he died. Roth still tears up, 40 years later, recalling his loss.\n\nFor a decade, the farm grew and prospered. Then, Roth faced his first major challenge. Back then, almost all of the farm's workers were Black. But as the workers began aging out of farm labor, it was becoming harder to find new people to take their place. Though Roth had found reason to continue his father's lucrative profession, he realized with some consternation that the people he employed in low-wage field jobs didn't raise their own children to follow them: \"No farmworker raises their kids to be farmworkers.\"\n\nOther Belle Glade farms were responding to the worker shortage by hiring newly arrived Mexican immigrants. Roth Farms hired a new Latino crew leader to help bring them in. By the end of the 1990s, \"half of our employees working in seasonal jobs probably were illegal,\" Roth said. \"Everybody knew that.\"\n\nThe immigrant workers Roth hired were young, strong and plentiful, and they were willing, he has said, to work for less money than Americans. That assumption brought trouble. By the late 1990s, nearly all of his workers were Latino, and in 1999, a group of nine of them filed a class action lawsuit against Roth for racial and national origin discrimination. They alleged that they earned up to $1.50 less per hour than the small remaining Black crew of a dozen or so workers. Roth at the time denied that any wage disparities were based on race.\n\nThe two sides reached a settlement, with Roth Farms agreeing to pay $124,000 to cover the additional wages the workers alleged they were owed. Roth declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nAs the farm continued to benefit from a fairly steady stream of workers from Mexico, Roth became convinced that those workers should be entitled to legal status. He felt that farms like his couldn't just keep on hiring undocumented immigrants forever, or at least they shouldn't have to. He began making treks to Washington, D.C., to advocate for an easier path for undocumented workers to become legal ones.\n\nThe bills that would have done that didn't pass. But Roth kept up his advocacy efforts, reiterating that U.S. citizens would never return to farm work, even with higher wages, and that without immigrant workers, the U.S. would need to begin importing more food.\n\nIn 2011, Florida lawmakers began deliberating a series of bills modeled after a recent Arizona law that would make it a crime to be undocumented in Florida, allow police to check people's immigration status and crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers. The Arizona law, and similar ones in Alabama and Georgia, played out as anticipated. Workers left. Fields of vegetables rotted.\n\nOne of the Florida bills also would have required private employers to run all hires through E-Verify, the system for checking legal work status, and imposed fines on companies that employ undocumented immigrants. In response, Roth intensified his public opposition. Those bills failed.\n\nWhen Congress later that year considered the Legal Workforce Act, including an E-Verify requirement, Roth again spoke against it, telling the Palm Beach Post : \"This is a repetitive job for people who don't speak the language. These people pick the crops for other people who have air-conditioned jobs.\"\n\nGenerations of Garcia's family members had worked on farms, but he didn't grow up thinking it was an inevitability. He wanted to go to college, maybe even become a doctor.\n\nHe was in high school when he met Enriquez, who was 15 at the time and a guest at his cousin's wedding. She was struck by how serious he was, and how smart. No matter her question he had an answer.\n\nEnriquez's parents were strict. She liked to go out, much more than Garcia did, but she could only meet him in public with her parents in tow, at community gatherings or the annual festival celebrating the town's patron saint. Otherwise, he could come to the family's house.\n\nBy the time Garcia moved in with Enriquez and her parents, when she was 18 and he was 20, he'd had to give up on going to college. There was no money for that. He went to work in a local dairy, then to the fields and the vegetable packing houses.\n\nA year after he moved in, Garcia and Enriquez married. He didn't want to start a family too soon, though. He wanted to save up for a house of their own. They made it three years. A house was still a distant possibility, but Garcia took the pregnancy as the best news.\n\nThe baby was 6 months old when Enriquez became convinced that something wasn't right. Isaac was not developing the way he should. She started to look for help. Eventually, she brought Isaac to a private doctor, who said the baby needed to see a neurologist.\n\nThat one appointment was nearly a week's salary. The neurologist scheduled a scan of the child's brain. Enriquez and Garcia cobbled together what they could, figuring that it was just enough to pay for the scan and cover the bus fare to the facility for her, Isaac and his godmother, who wanted to come along. But when they got there, the scan was more than they were expecting, and more than they had. Isaac's godmother came up with the remainder, but they were left with no money to get home. They found a bus willing to let them pay the fare at the destination. On the way, Enriquez called a friend to meet the bus and lend her the fare.\n\nThe more stressed her husband got, the quieter he became. And in the weeks after the scan, he said very little. He was also working constantly. The neurologist had explained that Isaac had cerebral palsy, which meant he would need a speech therapist, physical therapy and a nutritionist. The rehab facility was an hour and a half away by bus. The therapy sessions cost 1,200 pesos, or about $60, every week. The most Garcia could bring home each week, working as much overtime as he could, was 2,000 pesos. Typically it was more like 1,500.\n\nJust as they got help covering the cost of Isaac's treatment, he was diagnosed with a second condition, autism. The new medication cost more than what they'd been spending to manage his cerebral palsy.\n\nThe need for Garcia to go north was no longer merely important. It was urgent. He turned to his wife and said: \"I have to find another solution.\" And that's when the H-2A visa came up.\n\nAfter years of lobbying against various laws, Roth began to wonder if he could do more for farmers by joining the Legislature rather than fighting it. In 2016, he announced his run for a Florida house seat.\n\nNot long after Roth won his race, Donald Trump entered the White House. Roth wholeheartedly supported Trump, but he would soon find that the president's immigration agenda created a new problem for his farm. \"With Donald Trump, there were not a lot of illegals coming to America,\" Roth acknowledged, which aligns with the low numbers of immigrants who crossed the border during much of the former president's first year in office. \"We started to have to say, 'Well, now what are we going to do?'\"\n\nFor a time, he did what he'd always done: He fought actions that would harm undocumented workers and their employers. He voted against a 2019 E-Verify bill pushed by DeSantis. But he was more quiet about his opposition, he said, refraining from the strong language he'd previously used. The bill died in committee.\n\nIt was around that time that Roth, along with his son, who'd taken over the day-to-day operations of the farm, found a fix. It was available to only a sliver of the state's employers: an agricultural visa program called H-2A.\n\nThe program, which allows the U.S. farming industry to bring in foreign laborers on a temporary basis, had been around in some form since the 1940s. But until recently Roth had little need for it - his workers, documented and not, came back every year. Plus, he had considered the program's requirements to pay more than the minimum wage and cover the cost of transportation from Mexico and housing in Belle Glade too expensive. But, like many other farmers who'd struggled with labor shortages, he came around to it. The program could dependably deliver legal workers. H-2A visa certifications have increased fourfold in the last decade, and nowhere are there more of these workers than in Florida.\n\n\"H-2A,\" Roth said, \"was really the only choice.\"\n\nWhen Florida's anti-immigration SB 1718 came around in 2023, Roth had an almost entirely H-2A workforce - which made it easier for him to support legislation that purported to push out undocumented workers. As for how to explain his change of heart to constituents: \"Given the border crossing that's going on, we did need to send a strong message,\" he said. \"If you're illegal, don't come to Florida. We're gonna make it tough on you.\"\n\nBut some of his constituents couldn't help but get a different message: \"We're going to make it tough on your workers.\" They told Roth that the law itself, not the far-away border crossings, posed the immediate threat to their livelihoods.\n\nEventually, the potential for the law's harm began to sink in. Weeks after his vote for SB 1718, in the summer of 2023, Roth showed up at meetings across his district on a campaign of damage control. \"I apologize to you for this bad bill,\" he told a group gathered at a local church, with the help of a Spanish interpreter.\n\nRoth made numerous statements in public and private meetings that the law is predominantly political, intended \"to help a governor run for president.\" He said it had been laced with \"purposeful loopholes\" to protect employers from too much harm. For one, it doesn't apply to small businesses with fewer than 25 workers. But chief among the loopholes, Roth said, is that the E-Verify requirement doesn't extend to undocumented immigrants who already have jobs. \"If you like your job, keep your job,\" he's become fond of saying.\n\nRoth admits that, even today, he may have longtime workers who are undocumented. When workers in his own packing house started asking questions about the law, he said he \"instructed all my management what to say, and I just told them very clearly, 'This new bill that you're hearing all this talk about does not apply to workers that already have a job.'\"\n\nThe full impact of SB 1718 is still not clear. Its E-Verify provisions did not take full effect until July. For some employers, it's made life more difficult. \"I can't grow,\" said Mark Baker, who owns a 40-year-old landscape and plant nursery in Delray Beach. He lamented that he can't use the H-2A program, since his workers aren't temporary. \"I want to open another office, but I can't because I can't even staff the office I have.\"\n\nDespite having voted to crack down on immigrants in Florida, Roth maintains he still supports broader immigration legalization and insists it's up to Washington to take action. He also admits he thinks such a fix is far off. What he knows for sure is that for farms like his, H-2A is working, that it incentivizes workers to come here the right way - with the assurance that worker and farmer alike will be protected.\n\nThat September 2023 morning started like so many others. Enriquez caught the bus to take Isaac to physical therapy. This time her husband came along. They stopped to eat something on the way back home, then Garcia collected the bags he had packed.\n\nIf he was nervous or frustrated or scared, he didn't show it.\n\nGarcia's parents picked up the three of them to drive Garcia to the bus station. It would be tortuous for him to be away from his family, but the consolation was that the job would only last five months. It was dusk when they got to the bus stop, and they couldn't linger. It was unsafe to be out in the dark. They hugged him tight. \"Take care of our boy,\" he said.\n\nGarcia spent the following days sorting out paperwork with a labor subcontractor who specializes in recruiting Mexicans to work on U.S. farms. He knew a little about where he was headed: Belle Glade. His wife's aunt had immigrated to a nearby town years earlier. Once he arrived, he visited with her before settling into his barracks-style lodging near the sugar cane fields, which happened to be just a few miles from Roth's fields. Garcia texted his wife that he would try his best to get some rest that night, since he would start work in the morning.\n\nThe following afternoon, Sept. 13, 2023, Enriquez was just getting back from taking Isaac to therapy when someone called from Florida. It was a woman from the company that had hired Garcia. Her husband was fine, the woman said. He had fainted in the fields, she explained, which was something that happened from time to time, because of heat nearing 90 degrees. But no, he couldn't talk to her right then. He was still unconscious. The woman gave Enriquez the name of the hospital where he was recovering.\n\nAs soon as they hung up, Enriquez called her aunt, who headed to the hospital. But when she arrived, she was told that Garcia had been transferred, to Palms West Hospital in Loxahatchee.\n\nIn the hours that followed, the calls to Enriquez accelerated. Amid all the ringing and buzzing, someone arranged that night for a video call so she could see her husband. He still hadn't woken up. She spoke softly to him, trying to hold back her panic over the cables and tubes that crisscrossed his body, including one helping him breathe.\n\nIt was very early the next morning when the hospital called again. They needed Enriquez's permission to resuscitate her husband. The words instinctively came to her - yes, save him - and she sprang into action. She realized she would need to somehow quickly cross the border to get to her husband. It seemed as if one minute, she was handing off Isaac to her mother and the next she was 900 miles away at the border crossing at Matamoros, Garcia's mother by her side.\n\nThe two women had to wait on the Mexican side of the bridge for several hours. As they sat outside in the middle of the night, the hospital called again. They needed Enriquez to agree to resuscitate her husband. Again she said yes.\n\nThe nurses ventured one more question. In the event of a third resuscitation, would Enriquez have the same answer? Her husband was no longer well, they said. He was suffering. Enriquez weighed the pain in her soul. No, she said. Not a third time.\n\nThe border crossing took all day. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had to ask so many questions to approve the two women for the humanitarian permit. Hours passed. Enriquez was aware that authorities kept trying to reach people at the hospital to confirm her husband's condition.\n\nFinally, the permits were approved. As the two women left the CBP building in Brownsville, Texas, an official saw them out, holding open the door. It would be the first time either woman had crossed into the United States. All the man said was, \"I'm very sorry.\"\n\nRoth had heard about the death of a worker on a nearby farm. He said it was sad. He also said one of his first thoughts was one of worry, about what state or federal agencies would do in response. \"It's a big deal that somebody died,\" Roth added. But \"the government tends to overreact.\"\n\nIn late 2023, Roth returned to Tallahassee to serve his final session in the Florida House before he termed out. He has plans to run for state Senate in 2026. Among the last bills he co-sponsored as a member of the House was one that would prevent local governments in Florida from implementing workplace heat protections.\n\nIt was introduced in reaction to a proposal in Miami-Dade County that would have required water, breaks and shade for outdoor workers. Roth had joined a chorus of business groups pushing forcefully to ban the local labor ordinance. \"I'm a little bit insulted that some government bureaucrat thinks they need to help me take care of my employees,\" he told a local Fox affiliate.\n\nRoth had supported a bill four years earlier to require heat protections for student athletes, but he rejected the idea that Florida should impose protections for workers. He told ProPublica that employers don't need state or local government to require safeguards, since employers already have every incentive to protect their workers. Given the shortage of workers across the state, he said, \"do you really think they're not taking care of their employees?\"\n\nHe also pointed out that the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration already regulates workplaces, including fining those that don't offer heat protections. And ultimately, he said, it's the responsibility of workers and their crew leaders to make sure they're not putting themselves at risk. On his own farm, he said, workers know when they need to take breaks.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, days after the Florida Legislature passed the anti-heat protection bill, OSHA revealed the findings of its investigation into Garcia's death. It determined that the Belle Glade company that hired Garcia and other H-2A workers to local farms had failed to adequately protect workers from the heat.\n\n\"This young man's life ended on his first day on the job because his employer did not fulfill its duty to protect employees from heat exposure,\" the OSHA area director said in a statement. \"Had McNeill Labor Management made sure its workers were given time to acclimate to working in brutally high temperatures with required rest breaks, the worker might not have suffered a fatal injury.\"\n\nFor McNeill Labor Management Inc.'s failures to protect Garcia and to report his death to the government, OSHA issued the company a fine of less than $28,000.\n\nOwner Shannon McNeill told ProPublica that his company, which employs 700 mostly H-2A workers at the height of operations, provides workers with all of the protections that safety advocates call for, including water, shade and breaks. He also said that the company is now easing new hires more slowly into full-day shifts, a practice that OSHA already recommended. But he is contesting OSHA's determination that the company is responsible for Garcia's death.\n\nMcNeill Labor Management had paid for Garcia's body to be returned to Mexico and his funeral expenses. On a morning in July, before a heavy rain set in, Nohemí Enriquez left her son with her mother near the church in the town of Pueblo Nuevo and drove out of the town center to visit her husband's grave in a small, orderly cemetery. The flowers she placed there on her last visit had become dried and shriveled. She took them from the vase and threw them away, angry at herself for not bringing fresh ones. And then she prayed. \"For those I love and who loved me,\" his gravestone read.\n\nRead More\n\nOne week earlier, on July 19, Roth was in the audience as Trump spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee about \"a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across our land.\" He promised to deliver on a commitment to carry out \"the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.\"\n\nRoth, a party delegate from Florida, had spent the day before dancing and laughing on the floor with other delegates, as well as shedding a few tears. \"It was very emotional for me when Trump came out,\" he said.\n\nAsked a week later if the mass deportations would do harm to the agricultural industry in Florida, he responded with confidence that Trump would not actually engage in an indiscriminate mass deportation program. But even if that did happen, he said, there will always be a supply of H-2A workers waiting. \"We'll figure it out,\" he said. \"We'll get more.\"\n\nTranslations by Wendy Pérez, Jesús Jank Curbelo and Greta Díaz González Vázquez.\n\nFiled under -\n\nSeth Freed Wessler was a reporter with ProPublica's South unit who focused on immigration, the justice system and inequality.\n\nKathleen Flynn is a photojournalist and documentary filmmaker based in New Orleans.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "\"They Deserve to Be Safe\": Candidates Call on Florida to Investigate the Health Effects of Sugar Cane Burning\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with The Palm Beach Post . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFlorida Democrats running to represent the state's largest sugar-growing region in Congress say that state officials need to examine whether the industry's harvesting practices are harming the health of residents in Florida's heartland. The primary election, which will be held Tuesday, will likely decide the ultimate winner, given the heavily Democratic district.\n\nThe calls came in response to an investigation by The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica that found the Florida Department of Health ignored the recommendations of its own researchers to do such an assessment five years ago, despite mounting complaints from residents and multiple studies linking a practice known as cane burning to toxic pollution. Sugar companies are the largest employers in the region.\n\nFor about six months each year, from October through the following March, farmers burn sugar crops to rid the plants of their outer leaves, sending smoke and ash into the patchwork of largely Black and Hispanic communities known as the Glades. The companies say the practice is safe and heavily regulated by state agricultural and environmental officials. But, as the news organizations reported in August, state health researchers told their bosses in 2016 that the issue was ripe for more study, after finding significant levels of toxic pollutants known to cause cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory illness.\n\nSeven of the 11 Democrats vying to replace the late Rep. Alcee Hastings, a Democrat who died in April, said the Florida health department should now follow through with a health-risk assessment, a tool that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments use to pinpoint toxins in the environment and protect vulnerable communities.\n\n\"The only reason we don't know more about how sugar cane burning affects the health of Glades residents is because of the willful ignorance of public health officials in Florida's health department,\" said state Rep. Omari Hardy, a Democrat from West Palm Beach who is running in the special election for the vacant seat in the 20th Congressional District.\n\nAs The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica reported, local and state health officials have assessed the health risks of other pollutants in Palm Beach County at least 10 times since the 1980s, although they declined to do so in 2016 when it came to cane burning. The federal government provides funding and guidance to Florida and other states to do such assessments.\n\n\"I think those tests need to be conducted, and they really need to look at what's occurring there - before, during and after the burning - and see how that's affecting the people, and then move forward with some solutions,\" said Barbara Sharief, another candidate and a Broward County commissioner who owns a pediatric home health care firm.\n\nThe Rev. Elvin Dowling, a former Hastings aide running in the race, said the potential health effects of cane burning \"need to be investigated to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nFour other Democratic candidates - Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness, state Rep. Bobby DuBose of Fort Lauderdale, former Palm Beach County Commissioner Priscilla Taylor, and retired Navy officer Phil Jackson of Palm Beach County - agreed, saying they supported more health research. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick - a health-care executive from Broward County who has raised the most money in the race, primarily through loaning $3.7 million to her own campaign - declined to comment, while the others in the field did not respond to requests.\n\nTwo Republicans are also running for their party's nomination: Jason Mariner, CEO of a South Florida media company, and Greg Musselwhite, a welding inspector who ran against Hastings in 2020. The former did not respond to a request for comment and the latter did not answer questions, simply saying that the Post/ProPublica investigation had \"lots of great information.\"\n\nState officials have been largely silent on the issue of cane burning while expanding protections for the sugar industry. In April, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law legislation that makes it harder for residents to sue farmers over air pollution. DeSantis and the Florida Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The state-run Palm Beach County Health Department, where researchers first flagged concerns over the toxic pollution emitted by cane burning, issued a statement that did not address questions from the Post and ProPublica about whether the department should pursue a health risk assessment. \"The Department of Health continues to work with the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure we are upholding the Clean Air Act,\" the department said, noting its network of air monitors.\n\nIn the absence of a health risk assessment, The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica examined health trends in the Glades using state hospitalization data. The review found that hospital and emergency room visits for breathing problems among Belle Glade patients spiked during the cane-burning season - similar to a trend that local health officials first observed in clinics nearly 30 years ago. The seasonal difference in Belle Glade was bigger than changes in other similar populations where burning wasn't present.\n\nU.S. Sugar and Florida Crystals did not respond to requests for comment for this story, but both companies have denied that cane burning is responsible for residents' health problems. They have also said they are committed to operating safely in the Glades. U.S. Sugar previously took issue with the news organizations' health analysis, saying the underlying data lacked \"critical factors\" needed to draw any conclusions.\n\nThe harvesting practice has emerged as an issue in the congressional race because the region produces more than half the nation's cane sugar. Hastings, the district's previous representative, was co-chair of the House Sugar Caucus, an informal group of lawmakers who industry lobbyists once credited with \"helping to maintain quotas that keep cheaper foreign sugar out of the U.S. market,\" according to The Associated Press .\n\nSugar companies were among Hastings' biggest supporters. In 2020, he received $22,000 from U.S. Sugar's political action committee and affiliated individuals - the largest amount they gave to any congressional candidate that cycle, according to Open Secrets , which tracks political spending across the country. His second-largest source of contributions: individuals affiliated with Fanjul Corp. , which is the parent company of Florida Crystals, who gave a combined $16,800.\n\nFormer colleagues said Hastings was a fighter for the industry because it meant protecting jobs in the area. The sugar companies provide some 12,000 jobs to seasonal and permanent residents during the six-month harvest season.\n\nEnvironmental groups and some residents are now calling on the industry to end burning and switch to an alternative cultivation method, where blades are used instead of fire. The U.S. and China are the only nations among the top five sugar-producing countries that have not moved to phase out cane burning. American sugar interests, however, say the switch would not work due to the climate and soil makeup in South Florida. The transition, they say, would also lead to job losses.\n\nSome candidates acknowledge the economic importance of the industry, but see cane burning as a racial justice issue, too. The Glades area of Palm Beach County is made up of three cities that sit along the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, surrounded by the Everglades Agricultural Area. The residents are mostly Black and Hispanic families who have lived in the area for generations, as well as migrant field workers from the Caribbean and Central America. The largest city, Belle Glade, has a poverty rate of 41%.\n\n\"If I say 'Black Lives Matter,' I have to mean it not just when Black folks are getting killed by the police,\" Hardy told The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica. \"I have to mean it when their children are getting asthma because large corporations can't figure out how to make a profit off of sugar cane without fouling the air that those kids breathe.\"\n\nTaylor, a former Democratic state representative who represented the Glades area during her tenure, said rural residents living amidst hundreds of thousands of acres of sugar cane fields deserve the same governmental protection as residents who live in the more populated coastal areas of the county. About 40 miles to the east sits former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home and other wealthy enclaves.\n\nRead More\n\n\"The people in the Glades deserve the same as everyone else. They deserve to be safe,\" Taylor said. \"I think we should do everything possible to assure that.\"\n\nAt the local level, the mayors and city commissioners who represent the Glades have generally backed the sugar industry, emphasizing the importance of agricultural jobs to their communities. In fact, earlier this year, some testified in support of the bill that further protected sugar companies from lawsuits over air pollution.\n\nThe elected officials who represent the area at the county and state levels have largely declined to weigh in. Just two responded to requests for comment for this story: State Sen. Tina Polsky and Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay, the latter of whom was recently appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency's Local Government Advisory Committee, a panel for local officials to provide input on environmental and public health issues. Both of them, however, declined to speak on the issue of cane burning, citing an ongoing lawsuit that Glades residents have filed against sugar companies in federal court; neither the state nor the county are parties to the lawsuit.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAfter the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the months of protests that followed, the city of St. Louis was forced to reckon with its Black residents' longstanding distrust of its police and courts.\n\nKim Gardner emerged as a voice for change. A lifelong resident of St. Louis, she had diverse professional experiences, having worked as a funeral director, a nurse, a lawyer and a state legislator. When campaigning for circuit attorney, the city's top prosecutor, she focused on the disproportionate frequency of arrests and police officers using force against St. Louis' Black community.\n\n\"We need to change decades of old practices that left many in our community distrustful of the criminal justice system as a whole,\" she told The St. Louis American , the city's Black newspaper, just days before her decisive primary victory in August 2016 that all but sealed her general election win.\n\nIn the last decade, prosecutors in other major American cities also campaigned on promises of systemic reform: Kim Foxx in Chicago, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Chesa Boudin in San Francisco.\n\nYet, much like Gardner, these prosecutors have faced resistance from the police and the unions that represent rank-and-file officers. They've been accused of being soft on crime and have even been met with political maneuvers aimed at derailing their initiatives. Several have been targeted by efforts to remove them from office or pare away their powers.\n\nBoudin lost a recall vote and was removed in June 2022. And Krasner, criticized for his reduced emphasis on prosecuting minor crimes, was impeached by the state legislature in November, although a state court threw out the result.\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has removed elected prosecutors in Tampa and Orlando. He suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren over Warren's refusal to prosecute offenses related to abortion and gender-related health care. He suspended the state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties, Monique Worrell, because he said she wasn't tough enough on some serious offenses.\n\nGeorgia recently became the first state to establish a commission with the authority to discipline and even remove local elected prosecutors. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp framed the law as a way to check \"far-left prosecutors.\"\n\nGardner, who was reelected in 2020, stepped down in May of 2023 while facing both a lawsuit from the state attorney general that sought her removal and a separate attempt by the Republican-led legislature to curtail her authority. Gardner's mismanagement of her office played a significant role in her downfall. Reform-minded lawyers who she personally hired had departed. And while judges fumed about prosecutors failing to show up for court, Gardner was moonlighting as a nursing student.\n\nThough other prosecutors faced various challenges, there are no widely known instances like that of retired detective Roger Murphey in St. Louis, who has refused to testify in at least nine murder cases and hasn't received any departmental discipline.\n\n\"For every progressive prosecutor who's managed to stick it out, there's one who's either been recalled or driven out,\" said Lara Bazelon, a University of San Francisco law school professor who volunteered on Boudin's campaign and serves as chair of the commission he created to review inmates' claims of innocence. \"So it's a real mix of success and cautionary tales.\"\n\nShe added: \"If the police are against you, or literally out to get you, you're probably not going to be able to last in that job.\"\n\nFoxx, elected in 2016 and reelected in 2020, announced in April that she will not seek a third term next year, though she said it was not because of resistance from the police. In an interview, Foxx said that even before she took office, the Chicago police union felt threatened by her assertion that Black lives matter and that the criminal justice system could be more fair, particularly to communities of color.\n\nIt was a signal, she said, \"that I was not one of them.\"\n\n\"The reality is we were offering something very different to what was traditionally viewed as the law-and-order approach to prosecution,\" Foxx said. \"I think it was surprising to folks that prosecutors could be elected addressing these issues.\"\n\nR. Michael Cassidy, a law professor at Boston College and an expert in prosecutorial ethics, said the Ferguson unrest emphasized the need for change in how police and prosecutors work. He said some prosecutors have failed to manage their relationships with police; prosecutors depend on the officers to bring them cases and to testify in court, but they must conduct oversight of the police as well.\n\nFoxx pushed back against any assertion that she didn't manage her relationship with police. She pointed to a popular Chicago police blog that often refers to her as \"Crimesha\" - \"a play on the word 'crime' and what I believe to be a racist insinuation about me being Black with the name '-esha.'\" The blog has also sexualized her last name by adding a third X and has insinuated that members of her family are connected to gangs.\n\n\"From the moment we came into office, we reached out to our partners in law enforcement, and what we saw was there was a segment of them who were never going to be satisfied with me in this role because I said 'Black lives matter,' because I said 'We need police accountability,' because I said that we had a criminal justice system that overly relied on incarceration that targeted Black and brown communities,\" she said.\n\nShe said that she, Gardner and other prosecutors \"have been faced with an unprecedented level of hate and vitriol\" from the police.\n\n\"That,\" she said, \"is the story.\"\n\nChicago Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara and other union officials did not respond to requests for comment. But Catanzara told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2020 that the union's complaints about Foxx were based on her job performance. He said she was a \"social activist in an elected law enforcement position\" who was unwilling to \"faithfully do her job.\"\n\nBoudin was elected in 2019 on a reform platform. Soon after taking office, he eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. He also brought criminal charges against nine city officers for misconduct and announced a plan to compensate victims of police violence .\n\nBut as property crime rates climbed in San Francisco, Boudin came under increased scrutiny.\n\nCassidy said Boudin and other like-minded prosecutors have been scapegoated for isolated incidents or temporary spikes in crime statistics, as if they alone are responsible. In some cities, that has swung public opinion against them.\n\nBoudin said the claims were unfair and largely the product of police resistance to his reforms.\n\n\"We've seen, on body-worn camera footage, police officers telling victims there's nothing they can do and, 'Don't forget to vote in the upcoming recall election,'\" Boudin said in an interview.\n\nBoudin said he and other local prosecutors have found \"there is absolutely zero accountability for these officers who engage in explicitly political acts of sabotage or dereliction of duty.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco police union declined to comment.\n\nSome prosecutors have held onto their positions despite challenges to their power. In November, veteran public defender Mary Moriarty was elected county attorney for the jurisdiction that includes Minneapolis in the first election since the death there of George Floyd. The same night, Dallas District Attorney John Creuzot was reelected by a nearly 20-point margin in spite of calls by a police union for his ouster over his plan not to prosecute certain low-level offenses.\n\nIn August 2022, Sarah George, the incumbent state's attorney in Vermont's Chittenden County, which includes Burlington, secured her seat with a 20-point victory in the Democratic primary over Ted Kenney, a challenger backed by the police.\n\nGeorge had introduced a variety of reforms, including eliminating cash bail and declining to prosecute cases where evidence was obtained during noncriminal traffic stops , like those for broken taillights. The Burlington police union called her actions \"disastrous\" and Kenney argued that the approach made streets less safe .\n\nGeorge, too, has seen police body camera video of officers blaming her for crime. In one video, which she provided to ProPublica, the Riverfront Times and NPR, an officer from a suburban police department tells a couple that officers can't do anything about a crack house in their neighborhood. He then implores them to vote for Kenney because of George's \"super-progressive, soft-on-crime approach where we arrest the same people daily and they get out the same day.\"\n\nGeorge said that, with some crime investigations, the police are \"not really doing the work that we need to do on the case, and then blaming us for the case not being filed.\"\n\nThe Burlington police union declined to comment. The chiefs of police in Burlington and Winooski, the suburb where the video was taken, did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nGardner, too, often faced criticism from police for her reluctance to prosecute cases based on arrests alone. In one notable instance in 2019, she dropped child-endangerment charges against two day care workers who were captured on video as they appeared to encourage toddlers to box using toy Incredible Hulk fists.\n\nThe police union called for her ouster, writing on Facebook: \"The first rule of toddler fight club is ... that you prosecute the sadistic promoters of toddler fight club.\"\n\nIn comments made before her resignation, Gardner noted that she had been careful not to file criminal charges in cases where she did not feel there was enough evidence. \"What they want me to do is make it look like this job is easy,\" she said. \"We can't make things fit and people don't like that. That's not what justice is about.\"\n\nRead More\n\nRichard Rosenfeld, a professor emeritus of criminology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, was one of several researchers who pooled data from 65 major cities and found \"no evidence to support the claim that progressive prosecutors were responsible for the increase in homicide during the pandemic or before it.\"\n\nIndeed, Chicago's murder rate fell during Foxx's first years in office, rose during the first years of the pandemic and has been falling this year, city crime statistics show. Philadelphia's murder rate was in steep decline this year after a precipitous rise that started in 2020. And most categories of crime were in retreat in St. Louis at the time Gardner resigned, while violent crime was up in San Francisco a year after Boudin's exit, according to statistics.\n\nAcknowledging that the St. Louis police commonly blamed Gardner for crime trends, Rosenfeld, a veteran observer of policing in St. Louis, said, \"Case not proved, is what I would argue there.\"\n\nOct. 11, 2023: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that former San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin dismissed charges in a rape case in 2021 and that it was a factor in his recall.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI am a St. Louis-based reporter covering Missouri and the Midwest.\n\nI'm interested in tips about abuses of power, political influence, harmful policing and court practices, reproductive rights, public spending, and illegal or unethical business practices in Missouri and the Midwest.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

He starts on March 31.\n\nAriza comes to ProPublica after three years as a national investigative reporter at Floodlight, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom that covers the forces stalling climate action. His reporting on the secret political life of power companies brought to light how operatives working for these companies used untraceable political donations to surveil journalists , dictate news coverage and buy support among civil rights groups. Ariza's co-reported coverage contributed to the unexpected retirement of at least one power company CEO in 2023. The series was a finalist for the Goldsmith Prize and won both the Los Angeles Press Club's award for reporting on misinformation and the 2024 Southern Environmental Law Center's Reed Award. More recently, his work has focused on the effects of the Trump administration's funding freezes on small farmers and rural businesses.\n\nBefore joining Floodlight, Ariza was an investigative reporter at the South Florida Sun Sentinel. He was a key member of reporting teams that investigated Gov. Ron DeSantis' pandemic response , the use of police K-9s in Broward County and the lobbyists who weakened Florida's condominium safety laws.\n\nA Dominican immigrant who came to the United States as a child and grew up in Miami, Ariza has written deeply about the present and future effects of climate change on the region, including in his 2020 book \" Disposable City: Miami's Future on the Shores of Climate Catastrophe .\"\n\nWith Ariza's arrival, ProPublica's five regional offices will have local reporters in 18 states.

      "text": "Exclusive: Ron DeSantis on Fatherhood, Parents' Rights, and the 2024 Campaign\n\nT o hear Ron DeSantis tell it, his message hasn't changed. \"I think we were viewed, really from Day One, as the candidate that had the strong record on the issues important to parents,\" he tells me, sitting at a table in a shaded pavilion on the sidelines of the Iowa State Fair. \"It has been an issue, really, from the beginning,\" he says of the \"parents' rights\" agenda that has been central to his struggling presidential candidacy. \"And so I do think we've tapped into that, and we'll continue to do it.\"\n\nThat may be the case, but something has clearly changed, starting with the fact that I'm interviewing DeSantis at all. For years, he has cast his opposition to the mainstream media in ideological terms, arguing that conservatives shouldn't contribute to its legitimacy and shutting out any outlet this side of Fox News. But now, as he struggles to gain traction in the Republican primary against former President Donald Trump, DeSantis wants to talk to me about why he believes being the \"parents' candidate\" will boost his political prospects.\n\nAs governor of Florida, DeSantis says, education policy is part of his purview, but it's also personal. \"I also just see it through the lens of a dad of a six, five and three-year-old,\" he says, before switching to his usual first-person-plural. \"We understand some of the things that parents are concerned about and that parents are going through. And that impacts how we view these policies, particularly when it goes to things like parents' rights to be involved in the education.\" On issues like school choice and curriculum transparency, he says, \"in Florida, it's not just Republican parents that care about that. A lot of independents and some Democrats were really appreciative of some of the stands we've taken.\"\n\nA few yards away from where we sit on wooden folding chairs, DeSantis's wife Casey comforts their son Mason, 5, who is \"having a morning\" and feeling out of sorts. Later in the day, the two girls, 6-year-old Madison and 3-year-old Mamie, will join them, and the family will spend hours traipsing through the fairgrounds-going on rides, playing games-a show of wholesome, typical family behavior that's clearly aimed at showing the softer side of an introverted candidate often derided as wooden. The campaign's hope is to humanize the policy-focused DeSantis by linking his record to his personal life.\n\nThat record is hardly uncontroversial. Education and parental rights issues have been central to DeSantis's agenda, which has departed from traditional Republican themes and emphasized hard-right culture wars. He pushed to open schools and opposed mask mandates in the fall of 2020; signed legislation, termed \"don't say gay\" by critics, that banned the teaching of sex and gender before eighth grade, sparking an ongoing clash with Disney; barred transgender minors from accessing gender-affirming medical treatments, being called their preferred pronouns, or using their preferred bathrooms at school; crusaded against critical race theory, drafting new educational standards that have drawn criticism for their approach to slavery ; mandated \"curriculum transparency\" that allows parents to challenge books used in classrooms, leading to restrictions that critics call book bans; and passed a sweeping school-choice law. All of these, in DeSantis's view, are planks in a platform that adds up to protecting children's innocence and safeguarding parents' role as the primary decision-makers in their kids' education.\n\nFraming it all as a crusade for \"parents' rights\" is a neat trick politically, highlighting a throwback, traditionalist view of what used to be termed \"family values,\" but with a very 2023 culture-war spin. \"Kids should be kids-there shouldn't be an agenda,\" he tells me. \"I didn't feel like there was an agenda when I was growing up.\" It has the potential to remind voters of DeSantis's aggressive policy record while highlighting his relative youth and vigor-an implicit contrast with the thrice-married, 77-year-old frontrunner, whose wife and eldest daughter have declined to campaign with him this time around. At the same time, skeptics point to DeSantis's slipping poll numbers and question whether all this resonates with an electorate polls show to be more concerned with kitchen-table issues.\n\nAs a father, DeSantis says, he's not the primary disciplinarian in the family, but he's capable of bringing the hammer down when needed. \"I'm kind of the good guy most of the time-I bring the presents, I bring treats, especially when I'm on the road,\" he tells me. \"Day to day, Casey does more of the disciplining. But when I step in, and I do, if I'm a little stern, they snap into shape. I do that more rarely. But when things get out of hand, you kind of just lay the law down, and they respond to it. So I would say that they do respect the paternal influence.\"\n\nDeSantis sits wide-legged in jeans and a short-sleeved dark-blue fishing shirt with his name embroidered above both breast pockets, elbows planted on knees as he leans forward in his folding chair. He converses easily, albeit without deviating much from his standard talking points, and makes eye contact throughout our half-hour conversation. When I press him on whether he's actually superseding parents' rights with his own agenda, he argues that his school-choice law allows liberal parents to send their kids to private or charter schools that might take a different educational approach than he might prefer for his own children, as long as they meet basic standards.\n\nI ask DeSantis about the rights of parents of trans children, who are being prevented by the state from accessing the medical care they may believe is in their kids' best interest. He points to the ongoing debate over transgender treatment in Europe, where some experts have recently been moving away from a purely affirmative approach, arguing that the state has an interest in preventing \"sterilizing children at age 13 or 14\" or performing sex-change surgery on minors.\n\n\"As a parent right now, I can't take my six-year-old daughter and get her a tattoo, even if I want to do that,\" he says. \"You don't have the right to do things that are going to be destructive to kids. I think that some of these parents are being told by physicians who are making a lot of money off this that you have to do this, otherwise your kid can end up doing something like commit suicide. I think that they get bullied into thinking this is the right decision.\" It is, he adds, \"totally appropriate for us to say that protection of children means that those things are not appropriate.\"\n\nDeSantis's attempt to personalize these issues has limits. When I ask how he was parented, he talks about where his parents were from-Youngstown, Ohio, and Aliquippa, Penn.-but says nothing about them as people. When I ask whether his view of the primacy of family comes from his faith, he responds in generalities rather than give a window into his personal spirituality. \"My marriage and family, that's just something that I always envisioned that would happen, and that's been something that's been very, very positive for me as a person,\" he says. (DeSantis isn't much for personal professions of devotion: \"I know he's Catholic, but I'm not even sure he attends Mass regularly,\" the president of the Florida Family Policy Council, a DeSantis ally, told The Atlantic in March.)\n\nAnd when I ask how he'll respond if one of his children turns out to be gay or trans, his eyes flash momentarily, and he swiftly shuts down the question. \"Well, my children are my children,\" DeSantis says. \"We'll leave that-we'll leave that between my wife and I.\"\n\nAfter our interview , DeSantis heads to a stage behind JR's SouthPork Ranch, where he is interviewed by Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, as part of her softball series of \"fair-side chats\" with the candidates. The beginning of the conversation is nearly drowned out by what appear to be liberal activists blowing whistles and banging cowbells. Ignoring Reynolds's plea for \"Iowa Nice,\" a blue-haired activist in a black \"Bitches Get Stuff Done\" T-shirt is finally hauled away after an extensive argument with the police. All the while, a small plane hired by the Trump campaign circles overhead, dragging a banner with the message, \"Be Likable, Ron!\"\n\nDeSantis emphasizes parents' issues and his own parenting throughout the interview, talking about keeping the schools open during COVID-19 and not wanting his daughters to have to compete against boys in school sports. He tells numerous cute-kid stories, most of which feature the children being dragged along on campaign and official events, like the time Mason fell asleep at his feet at a press conference. He highlights Casey's \"Mamas for DeSantis\" initiative, which she launched in Iowa at an event with Reynolds last month. \"When you go after the kids, you're awakening a sleeping giant,\" he says.\n\nDistractions aside, the audience appears receptive. \"I thought he was powerful,\" says Anne, 61, a physician from Ames who declines to give her last name but proclaims herself \"excited\" about DeSantis's candidacy. \"I like what he stands for. I like what he's done for the state of Florida.\" Anne tells me she previously voted for Trump but can no longer stomach him: \"I'm kind of embarrassed by the stuff he's been doing.\"\n\nDeSantis stops to answer questions from reporters, criticizing Trump for refusing to sign the Republican National Committee's loyalty pledge and promise to support the GOP nominee. \"It's not just about you,\" he says. \"You've got to be willing to stand up and support the team. And if someone's not willing to do that, that just shows you that they're running their campaigns more about them.\"\n\nThe DeSantises proceed to the pork producers' barn, where they gamely flip pork burgers. A cheer goes up as the governor flips the last one: the Trump plane has just been spotted flying overhead. A \"We Love Trump\" chant goes up from the former President's supporters, many of whom are following DeSantis around in order to troll him, wearing green-and-yellow \"Back to Back Iowa Champ\" hats.\n\nThe family ignores the provocations and makes a show of partaking in the fair, a highly artificial endeavor that nonetheless makes for a good photo op and seems at least somewhat fun for the kids. DeSantis and his wife each walk the fairway with a tiny, bespectacled daughter on one hip. They ride the bumper cars (\"Go easy on me!\" Ron jokes to Casey) and the ferris wheel. They play fairway games involving popping water balloons and throwing baseballs into a milk can. They stop by the Magic Maze, where Mamie hesitates atop a hot-looking blue plastic spiral slide. \"C'mon, you can do it!\" her dad shouts from down below. As the entourage passes the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox, where DeSantis has declined to appear and take public questions, a rival GOP candidate, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, can be heard declaiming, \"God is real! There are two genders!\"\n\nAs morning turns to afternoon, the atmosphere shifts. A crowd gathers around the Steer N' Stein, the open-air bar where Trump is scheduled to appear. The venue quickly fills up-screens inside advertise a $24-for-2024 \"MAGA Meal Deal\" consisting of a double cheeseburger, chili fries, and a 24-ounce soda, \"Already Fixing Inflation!\"-and a crowd at least 30 deep slowly expands around it. By the time Trump lands, the fair has virtually come to a standstill. Though the former President is in and out of the fair quickly, his status as the dominant force in the primary, the hub around which all things revolve, is affirmed.\n\nDeSantis's team has a tortoise-and-hare theory of the primary campaign. In our interview, the candidate waves off my questions about the much-hyped \"reset\" his operation has undergone, cutting a third of its staff and replacing the campaign manager. \"We're clicking, we're going to be good,\" he tells me. \"I don't think anyone in mid-January is going to look back and say, oh, you know, something that happened in June or July of the previous year is going to make much of a difference. All the stuff we need to do on the ground is being done in Iowa and New Hampshire.\" In other settings DeSantis, a former Navy officer and the only veteran in the race, has described the reboot in military terms, casting it as a structural recalibration to better align the operation with the \"commander's intent.\"\n\nJames Uthmeier, DeSantis's newly appointed campaign manager, who previously served as his gubernatorial chief of staff and has never managed a political campaign, says the operation has beefed up its accessibility to media and hopes to deploy more surrogates going forward. \"The governor's got a great message, but people aren't going to know about it if we don't tell them,\" he tells me. Over and over in Iowa and New Hampshire, Uthmeier says, he hears voters say they were planning to vote for Trump but changed their minds after hearing from DeSantis directly. \"We've got the smartest guy in the room, somebody who actually studies the policy, knows it inside and out, and has ideas to succeed in executing that policy,\" Uthmeier says. \"It's all about packaging that knowledge in a way that's clear and concise and relatable to voters.\" He likens DeSantis to a running back who waits for the right opening.\n\nIt's impossible to tell, at this point in time, whether this stance is savvy and patient or the latest version of the deus-ex-machina delusion that has plagued the GOP for nearly a decade now-a conviction that somehow Trump will be removed from contention or collapse on his own accord. Despite its poor track record, the belief has gained new purchase in light of what are delicately referred to as Trump's \"legal challenges,\" the four criminal indictments and 91 charges the former President now faces for everything from paying off a porn star to trying to overthrow the duly elected government.\n\nDeSantis is a Harvard-educated lawyer who stresses law and order, and, at least when it comes to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the need for public officials to be held accountable. But when I ask about the indictments, he pivots to explaining why he would pardon Trump. \"When I'm President, we need a fresh start,\" he says. \"Just like Ford pardoned Nixon, we are going to move on from the Trump controversies.\" He goes on to argue that \"the Department of Justice is highly political\" and launches into an extended legal analysis of the Washington-based federal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, which he calls \"flimsy charges.\"\n\n\"These are novel applications of the law, to conduct that has not traditionally been criminalized,\" he says. \"And I think that's why it's been viewed-at least in my judgment, and by people that think like me-very, very skeptically. Also, why all of a sudden are they doing this now? January 6 happened how many years ago, and I don't know what the agenda is behind that.\"\n\nDeSantis is hardly the only rival candidate to tiptoe around Trump, criticizing him on policy without condemning him outright. This forbearance has, of course, spared him none of Trump's wrath; Trump regularly accuses \"DeSanctus\" of having \"no personality.\" When I ask DeSantis to weigh in on Trump's own personality, he dodges, turning instead to his familiar electability argument. \"I must be doing something right to be able to have won a landslide re-election victory,\" he boasts. \"He was somebody that Biden beat him in that first debate in 2020 and beat him very soundly. I think that there are millions of voters out there who do not like Biden, do not like the direction of the country, but just will never vote for Donald Trump.\" This argument, conveniently, is in the third person: the problem, as he describes it, isn't that DeSantis dislikes Trump personally, but that others do.\n\n\"What we were able to do in Florida is a massive coalition,\" DeSantis says. \"Yes, we won Republicans big, I won Republicans by more than anyone has ever done. 97% of Republicans voted for me.\" But he also, he notes, won independent voters and women voters. \"And that's what we need, because clearly what we've done nationally recently is not enough to be able to get the job done,\" he says. \"I just think that the voters are begging for an alternative to Biden that they can get behind, and I would be that vessel.\"\n\nWrite to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com"

      "searched_phrase": "Ron DeSantis",
      "website": "https://time.com",
      "text": "The DeSantis Project\n\nI t's a Tuesday morning in Tallahassee, and a wood-paneled hearing room at the Florida legislature is packed. The state senate's fiscal-policy committee is considering a bill to prohibit most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and dozens of citizens have lined up to testify: anguished young students in colorful hair and \"abortion is health care\" T-shirts; little old ladies wearing cardigans and crosses. For hours they speak in emotional terms as the senators listen.\n\nYet an air of inevitability hangs over the proceedings. Governor Ron DeSantis supports this bill, and therefore it is destined to pass. In Tallahassee these days, what the governor wants, the governor gets. It is DeSantis who welcomed this fight, DeSantis who calls the shots, and DeSantis who will reap the credit-or blame-for his latest move in a frenzy of right-wing policymaking.\n\nHis dominance is hard to overstate. From school-board meetings to the Walt Disney Corp., the shelves of elementary-school libraries to local mask ordinances, everything bears his stamp. Having shepherded his state through the COVID-19 pandemic, bucking the political and medical establishments to follow his own read of the data, DeSantis has manipulated levers of power to enact a sweeping agenda. The week I landed in Tallahassee, he signed an expansive school-voucher law and a measure investing more than $700 million in affordable housing. The legislature was hearing his proposed ban on gender-affirming health care for minors, a bill to expand gun rights that would allow concealed carrying of firearms without a permit, another that would dramatically curtail union rights, and a bid to prohibit socially conscious investing. All would eventually pass. At DeSantis' behest, legislators this year also eliminated diversity programs at public universities, made it easier to sentence criminals to death, and barred schools from using trans students' preferred pronouns.\n\nFor a typical Republican governor, any of these policies might represent a signature achievement. For DeSantis, they're the latest line items in an agenda he calls the Florida Blueprint. \"We've had conservative leadership in Florida for the past 23 years, but we've passed more conservative bills in the past two years than the previous 20, and more this year than the past 22,\" says GOP state senator Joe Gruters. \"It's a rocket ship, a steam engine.\"\n\nOut of a combination of fear and mutual interest, legislators have put aside their own pet projects to do DeSantis' bidding, passing bills to shield his travel records from the public and allow him to run for President without resigning the governorship. They've also been enlisted to clean up his messes, retroactively legalizing his migrant flights to Martha's Vineyard last year and attempting to restore state control of the special tax district around Disney World amid the company's feud with DeSantis over LGBT rights. \"This governor has used all of his powers to make sure everyone around him is in lockstep,\" says Jeff Brandes, a libertarian-leaning former GOP state senator who lost a seat on a prized committee after clashing with DeSantis over fiscal issues.\n\nBy operationalizing the culture war into a set of concrete policies, DeSantis has transformed the nation's third most populous state. What was once the butt of jokes about gators and retirees is now the swaggering, Southern-tinged Free State of Florida-where men are men, woke is broke, and business is booming; 1,200 net new residents arrive every day. \"It's in the air, it's everywhere, it's amazing,\" says former GOP Representative David Jolly, no fan of the vibe shift. \"It's between neighbors, it's when you go to restaurants, when you go to schools. You're on one side or the other, and people know it.\" A Florida native, Jolly is considering moving his family out of the state.\n\nIf critics see DeSantis as a would-be authoritarian, allies see a conservative who gets things done. Many predicted that his hard-charging first term in office would provoke a backlash. Instead the opposite occurred. While Republicans across the country struggled last November, DeSantis romped to a 19-point re-election victory, the biggest win for a Florida governor in decades. What was once America's paradigmatic swing state now pulsates bright red. For the first time in modern history, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats. The people of Florida seem to like the steady hand-even if it's an iron fist.\n\nTo fans, DeSantis' success proves that a pugilistic, big-government conservatism that promises ruthless competence instead of Trumpian chaos can win broad support, including a growing share of working-class and minority voters. \"We've shown that you don't have to do it the liberal way, and we're the envy of the nation when you look at our results,\" says state representative Randy Fine, a Republican who has sponsored some of DeSantis' most controversial legislation and may soon be rewarded with an appointment as a university president despite no background in academia. \"DeSantis says what he's going to do and he does it. People like that, even if they don't agree with him.\"\n\nThe Blueprint has already done more than just make DeSantis the darling of right-wing media and donors. It has changed the face of American politics. His gerrymandering of the state's political map added enough red seats to secure the U.S. House of Representatives for the GOP last November. Fellow governors, invited by DeSantis to policy summits where they study his approach, have enacted laws modeled on his policies, affecting millions of lives beyond Florida. And his agenda has set the stakes for the 2024 presidential primary. Donald Trump's campaign has been notably more focused on transgender issues, education, and \"wokeness\" than on the tax cuts and vaccine development that might be considered his main presidential accomplishments .\n\nSoon DeSantis is expected to announce his presidential run and become Trump's chief rival for the Republican nomination. Trump has attacked him relentlessly, denting DeSantis' standing with GOP voters and sowing doubts about his national viability. But those who have witnessed DeSantis operate say it would be foolish to count him out. \"He's not charming,\" says GOP state representative Fiona McFarland. \"But he's a terminator.\"\n\nDeSantis' methods of keeping the legislature in line are not subtle. At one point, a Republican lawmaker was planning to oppose a DeSantis-backed bill until he got a phone call from the governor, who had helped the lawmaker get elected. Without preliminaries, DeSantis barked into the phone, \"Do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the startled lawmaker answered. Without saying another word, the governor hung up, two people familiar with the incident told me. Message delivered.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, DeSantis does not roam the halls of the Florida statehouse and spends little time in his office in the legislative building. The office, situated on the ground level, has become code for DeSantis, Politico recently reported . \"That's Plaza's bill,\" lawmakers will say.\n\nDeSantis, 44, was born in Jacksonville and raised in the Gulf Coast city of Dunedin, where his mother was a nurse and his father installed Nielsen TV-rating boxes. A book-smart introvert and talented baseball player, he graduated with honors from Yale University (where I knew him slightly) and Harvard Law School before joining the Navy. As a member of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps, he was stationed at Guantánamo Bay and then deployed to Iraq, where he served as a legal adviser to the SEALs during the 2007 troop surge.\n\nIn 2010, DeSantis left active duty and settled near Jacksonville, where he worked as a lawyer and married a local TV anchor, Casey Black, whom he met at a driving range. As the Tea Party fervor crested, he self-published a book of conservative ideas, Dreams From Our Founding Fathers, and traveled to local activist meetings to give talks and sell it. DeSantis was looking for a way into elected office but unsure where to start until he met two Florida consultants, Tim Baker and Brian Hughes, who had made a specialty of electing conservative insurgent veterans. DeSantis thought he might run for state legislature or some other low-level office. The consultants persuaded him he had a shot at a Jacksonville-area congressional district that had just been redrawn to favor the GOP.\n\nThe 2012 primary was crowded, and DeSantis had little money or name recognition. The consultants devised a guerrilla strategy designed to tap into the new conservative zeitgeist. Casey, a local celebrity, began using her married name on television. The couple went door to door, using his advisers' data to target households with the strongest record of voting in Republican primaries. Meanwhile, his consultants, who had agreed to backload their fees, gambled by spending nearly all of the campaign's meager budget on an ad on Fox News.\n\nDeSantis began to close the gap on his more experienced rivals. He impressed national right-wing groups and won the endorsement of the influential Club for Growth, which brought a flood of cash from donors. He won the seven-way GOP primary by a wide margin, drawing nearly 40% of the vote.\n\nBuoyed by this success, the consultants drew up a plan to raise DeSantis' profile as he headed to Washington. But the candidate dismissed them: he didn't want to spend more money with his election to Congress all but assured. It was only when Baker and Hughes expressed concern that the dispute might become public that DeSantis relented, according to two people familiar with the episode. Their role in his early career is not mentioned in DeSantis' new memoir, The Courage to Be Free, which describes the door-knocking strategy as if it were DeSantis' own idea. \"He has a habit of rewriting history,\" one of the people familiar with the episode told me. \"There's Richard Petty, there's Tom Petty, and then there's Ron DeSantis petty.\"\n\nOver three terms in the House, DeSantis was a reliable conservative not known for his people skills. Congressional colleagues describe him as strikingly aloof, rebuffing or ignoring friendly overtures and wearing earbuds to avoid conversation. A co-founder of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, DeSantis in his memoir describes his years in Congress as mostly frustrating. GOP leaders exercised top-down power, he argues, but weren't willing to fully use their leverage to achieve conservative goals. He does, however, tout his work on the Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers (PAWS) Act, which funded a program providing service dogs to veterans with PTSD.\n\nIn 2016, DeSantis briefly ran for the U.S. Senate seat that Marco Rubio had vacated to run for President, but dropped out when Rubio decided to return to the Senate. Instead, DeSantis announced a run for governor in 2018. It was another insurgent campaign: the Florida GOP establishment already had its handpicked candidate, Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner. But DeSantis again read the changing currents of the GOP. He appeared relentlessly on Fox, emerging as a reliable defender of Trump, particularly on the Russia scandal that enveloped the first years of the President's term.\n\nOn Dec. 8, 2017, DeSantis and a fellow right-wing Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz, hitched a ride on Air Force One to a Trump rally in Pensacola. Along the way, Gaetz urged the President to endorse DeSantis for governor. He described Putnam as a Never Trumper and read aloud a list of negative things Putnam had said about the President. A couple of weeks later, after catching another DeSantis appearance on Fox, Trump endorsed him on Twitter. DeSantis made the most of it, mentioning Trump 21 times in his first debate with Putnam and running an ad that jokingly showed him reading The Art of the Deal to his young children and \"building the wall\" with toy blocks.\n\nIn the general election, DeSantis faced Andrew Gillum, the progressive Black mayor of Tallahassee. In an early post-primary appearance, DeSantis said, \"The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda.\" Democrats decried his verbiage as a racist dog whistle. DeSantis refused to back down or apologize. But while many national observers remember that controversy, in Florida the campaign mostly focused on state issues. \"What Ron said to me in 2018 when we were laying out the strategy was, 'We're going to nationalize the primary and localize the general,'\" Gaetz tells me. \"The plan was to run against Putnam on national issues and then paint Gillum as in the pocket of Big Sugar.\" In a good year for Democrats, DeSantis defeated Gillum by less than half a percentage point.\n\nTrump has claimed credit for DeSantis' rise, but one former DeSantis adviser says the governor sees his success as foreordained. \"He has a providential belief that he will talk sincerely about. He believes he is exactly where God planned him to be at all times,\" the adviser says. \"I'm sure he believes, 'It was nice of Trump to help me kick the sh-t out of Adam Putnam. But it would have happened anyway.'\"\n\nThe Florida governorship has not always been a powerful position. Until 1968, the governor could serve only one term, and until the 1990s he (Florida has only had male governors) shared decisionmaking powers with six other statewide elected officials. Reforms that took effect during Jeb Bush's tenure in the early 2000s shrank the elected cabinet to just three members while also giving the executive more say in judicial nominations. At the same time, term limits approved by voters in a 1992 ballot initiative took hold, turning the legislature into a revolving door where lawmakers could no longer amass power over decades. As DeSantis entered office in 2019, the power of Florida's executive was already at a historic high.\n\nHe was determined to use every bit of it. \"One of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor,\" he writes in The Courage to Be Free. \"I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities.\" Aides from the time have corroborated this account, describing a thick binder of information that DeSantis proceeded to devour.\n\nConscious of his narrow victory, DeSantis initially sought to broaden his appeal. \"We got elected by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin, so the goal of the transition was to grow the universe of DeSantis supporters in the state of Florida and do better with nonwhite voters, independents, suburban women, and young people,\" says Gaetz, who chaired the transition to the governorship. (Once an ally of both men, Gaetz has grown distant with DeSantis since endorsing Trump's 2024 campaign.) DeSantis approved the sale of smokable medical marijuana, appointed Democrats to prominent posts in the administration, raised teacher pay, and proposed record levels of environmental funding for the Everglades. He posthumously exonerated the Groveland Four, Black men wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1949. When his proclamation honoring the third anniversary of the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando was criticized for failing to mention the affected groups, DeSantis' office reissued it with a new sentence decrying \"hatred towards the LGBTQ and Hispanic communities.\"\n\nEven early on, though, there were hints of a more assertive approach. DeSantis short-circuited the usual process for state supreme court nominations, allowing him to cement a conservative majority that would be unlikely to overturn his policies, as previous courts had done to his predecessors. He used a new, aggressive interpretation of his powers under state law to remove local elected officials, including Scott Israel, the Broward County sheriff whose response to the Parkland school shooting drew criticism. Previous governors had reserved that right for officials who broke the law, and a state senate special master recommended that Israel be reinstated, but DeSantis pushed through the removal. DeSantis' support for Everglades funding may have been less about the environment than getting back at the powerful sugar industry, whose generous subsidies he had opposed since his days in Congress and which had spent more than $10 million backing Putnam in the primary. \"Sugar is more powerful than Disney here, by far, and he took them on unapologetically,\" says Nick Iarossi, a Tallahassee lobbyist and DeSantis ally.\n\nBut it was the pandemic, critics and supporters agree, that changed DeSantis. After initially shuttering schools and restaurants, DeSantis grew frustrated by the lack of clear guidance from Washington and the medical establishment. He began doing his own research and soon concluded that much of the early conventional wisdom about COVID-19 was wrong. The spread of the virus could be mitigated but not contained, he believed. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York was being hailed by the media for his strong leadership even as he sent infected elderly people back to nursing homes, an act of tragic malfeasance intended to prevent a hospital-bed shortage that never materialized. Studying the emerging medical data, DeSantis concluded such fears were based on faulty models, and he almost certainly saved lives by isolating elderly patients. He soon reopened Florida's beaches, schools, and businesses while prioritizing protections, vaccines, and treatments for the most vulnerable citizens.\n\nGaetz, who talked to DeSantis daily during this period, says the governor often brought up the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, in which people were wheeled onto beaches for sunlight and ventilation. He fretted about the long-term mental-health effects of shutting people indoors and became emotional describing nursing-home residents dying in isolation, prohibited from seeing their loved ones. DeSantis had surveyed the landscape, watched a stampede of governors go one way, and determined he would do the opposite. \"It was very binary,\" Gaetz recalls. \"One group was going to be toast. The other was going to be vindicated.\"\n\nThe crisis hit right after the 2020 legislative session had concluded. Rather than call back the frightened lawmakers to address it, DeSantis seized new powers for himself. Declaring a state of emergency, he claimed unfettered authority to allocate pandemic funds from the federal government. He overrode local governments and school boards that tried to impose closures or mask mandates, and threatened to remove or withhold pay from local officials who sought further restrictions.\n\nOnce receptive to input from outside his orbit, he became convinced of his own rightness. \"COVID was definitely the switch that flipped, when he started to become a bully,\" says Nikki Fried, who served at the time as agriculture commissioner, the only Democrat elected statewide alongside DeSantis. Having initially welcomed her outreach, she says, during COVID-19 he stopped returning her calls. Fried, who now chairs the state Democratic Party, began calling DeSantis a \"dictator.\"\n\nAt a dinner in Austin in January 2021, Iarossi introduced DeSantis to Elon Musk. The two men proceeded to discuss disease vectors and biotherapies in obsessive detail. DeSantis \"was getting the sh-t kicked out of him on CNN,\" Iarossi recalls. \"And he said to me, 'Nick, I don't care what they say about me now. I care what they say six months from now. I've done the research, and I think I'm right.'\" At the time, loosening restrictions seemed like a risk, but DeSantis' confidence was unshakable. \"Everyone's in hysteria thinking the world is going to end, all his advisers are telling him not to. But business thrived, the economy thrived, people moved here. It took a year, not six months. But he was right.\"\n\nAs Trump left office and the pandemic waned, the governor grew more emboldened. In 2021 and 2022, the legislature pushed through DeSantis-backed bills to make it harder to vote, ban vaccine passports, and crack down on \"rioting\" at protests. The \"parental rights in education\" bill, better known as \"Don't Say Gay,\" prohibited the teaching of sex and gender in early elementary grades, while the Stop WOKE act banned the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) at schools and businesses. DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban, contingent on the yet-to-come reversal of Roe v. Wade, and began to express skepticism about the COVID-19 vaccines, appointing a new state surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who opposed vaccine and mask mandates while promoting unproven treatments.\n\nFavor-trading was not DeSantis' style; loyalty was not necessarily returned. At the end of one legislative session, he proceeded to theatrically veto budget priorities of the legislative leaders standing alongside him on the stage.\n\nWhen it came time to redraw the state's congressional districts in 2022, legislators proposed a new map that largely preserved the delegation's balance. A voter-approved constitutional amendment prohibited partisan gerrymandering and sought to protect minority districts, and lawmakers were wary of being slapped down by the courts if they went too far. But DeSantis had read the relevant laws and precedents, and in January 2022 he proposed his own map, which eliminated a majority-Black district in north Florida and gave the GOP a shot at up to four additional seats in Congress.\n\nNone too keen on this attempt to usurp their traditional responsibility, legislators ignored DeSantis and passed their own map instead. DeSantis vetoed it. At the same time, he let it be known that Senate president Wilton Simpson, who was running for agriculture commissioner, might not get his endorsement if he didn't go along. Finally, the legislature relented and passed DeSantis' map. A few days later, DeSantis endorsed Simpson, and another Republican candidate who had been running for the post dropped out. (The map, which governed the 2022 elections, still faces court challenges.)\n\nThe redistricting fight was pure DeSantis. \"He did that single-handedly-nobody pushed him-and he was relentless,\" one current GOP lawmaker told me. Brian Ballard, a powerhouse lobbyist in Tallahassee and D.C. and an ally of both Trump and DeSantis, says the gambit cemented his dominance. \"The [state] senate didn't lay down for him at first. But he showed he was able to use his political popularity in a way that previous governors had not, and it's brought him incredible power.\"\n\nDeSantis' chief of staff, James Uthmeier, says he has never seen a policymaker so hands-on. \"He sits and talks through the nitty-gritty of policy and the budget,\" says Uthmeier, who previously served as a senior official in Trump's Commerce Department. \"He's ingrained in the process in a way I haven't seen working in the Trump Administration or with other public officials.\"\n\nWith polls showing DeSantis' approval ratings among Florida Republicans in the 90s, he moved to spend his skyrocketing political capital. Traditionally, the state senate caucus had recruited candidates for office and funded their campaigns, but DeSantis had other ideas. In statehouse races in the Tampa and Jacksonville areas, he announced his own handpicked candidates, prompting those backed by the senate to drop out. Republicans who went against him drew complaints from their constituents. In the 2022 election cycle, several Florida political consultants told me, their research found DeSantis' endorsement to be the single most important attribute for GOP primary voters. \"In 2020, every member in a strong Republican seat campaigned with a picture of Donald Trump,\" says GOP state representative McFarland. \"In 2022, they campaigned with a picture of Ron DeSantis.\"\n\nHis political aims didn't stop at the statehouse. In another unprecedented move, he issued a raft of down-ticket endorsements as well. Working with the conservative parents'-rights group Moms for Liberty, he backed slates of school-board challengers in districts across the state, targeting boards that had tried to impose school closures and mask mandates during the pandemic. He moved to fill the state bureaucracy with the like-minded, stacking traditionally nonpartisan university and hospital boards with right-wing warriors like the anti-critical-race-theory activist Christopher Rufo. When a locally elected Democratic prosecutor announced he would not enforce DeSantis' abortion and transgender policies, DeSantis removed him based on his own reading of the relevant statutes. (A court ruled that the rights of the prosecutor had been violated, but that his dismissal could stand.)\n\nDeSantis and his aides went to war with the press, ignoring media requests or publicizing inquiries they considered off-base on Twitter, urging fans to swarm and harass reporters. At press conferences, he delights in berating members of the \"corporate media,\" often challenging the premise of their questions and accusing them of bias. He scrupulously avoids the mainstream media, once theatrically turning down an invitation to appear on The View. This year, DeSantis' proposal to make it easier to sue media outlets for libel was one of a handful of initiatives the legislature balked at. (DeSantis' staff did not respond to multiple requests to interview him for this article.) At the same time, DeSantis carefully tends his image in conservative media. He appears frequently on Fox News, once granting the channel exclusive rights to cover a bill signing, and doles out interviews and exclusives to right-wing influencers and publications. A pair of local digital outlets , Florida's Voice and the Florida Standard, popped up shortly after DeSantis was elected, helmed by writers with backgrounds in conservative activism. Their funding sources are unknown, but with DeSantis' help, they frequently break news about the governor, forcing the rest of the press corps to follow their lead. The strategy has made him a household name to the national GOP base, and he attracts large crowds at appearances across the country.\n\nDeSantis' policies drew the notice of other red-state governors across the country, who began to see Florida as a laboratory for conservative policy. A raft of states have introduced legislation mirroring \"Don't Say Gay,\" and many have followed his lead with bans on transgender athletes and CRT. His battle with Disney has galvanized a national GOP war on \"woke\" business practices like environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. DeSantis donor retreats in Fort Lauderdale last July and Palm Beach in February were styled as policy conferences, with attendees including GOP governors. He was not the first Republican governor to transport border-crossing migrants to liberal cities-a gambit the Trump Administration had considered but rejected as too extreme-but by flying them to tony Martha's Vineyard, he managed to up the ante.\n\n\"What DeSantis has done which his predecessors did not do is exploit all of the power inherent in the office of the governor,\" says Mac Stipanovich, a longtime GOP lobbyist and operative in Tallahassee who left the party after Trump's election. \"Just because you have the right to do something doesn't make it right, and his predecessors were conscious of that. There were guardrails. But if he has the right he doesn't hesitate-and the voters like a strongman.\"\n\nAs a popular governor with a weak Democratic opponent, DeSantis was virtually guaranteed to win re-election in 2022. But he craved something bigger. With a war chest of more than $100 million, he instructed his campaign that he wanted to run on his record. Admakers were told to focus on his policies-even the ones that didn't poll well in isolation. The campaign ultimately produced some 70 different commercials, each looking backward at the accomplishments of DeSantis' first term. Not a single ad focused on his promises for the future.\n\nDeSantis took the resulting landslide as vindication. If past editions of the legislature tended to do DeSantis' bidding, this year's session-with a GOP supermajority in both the state house and senate stacked with newcomers he handpicked-was engineered to work his will. DeSantis passed down a list of more than 40 legislative priorities and pushed the lawmakers to get started early. Twice before the official March kickoff, he called special sessions to knock out priorities that could have waited, like insurance reform.\n\nTallahassee observers believe the flurry was choreographed to tee up the launch of a presidential bid that will place his policy record at its center. But unlike the legislative session, the pre-campaign has not gone according to plan. DeSantis stumbled on foreign affairs out of the gate, drawing harsh criticism for a statement that described Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a \"territorial dispute.\" Trump has savaged him in personal terms. Some Republicans worry that DeSantis' rush to the right on issues like abortion may come back to bite him.\n\nEven allies wonder if DeSantis is cut out for the intense human interaction required in a national campaign. An April trip to D.C. to meet with his former colleagues in Congress ended disastrously , producing a flood of anecdotes about his antisocial ways on Capitol Hill and a slew of new congressional endorsements for Trump. The same bunker mentality that has made DeSantis more feared than loved, enabling him to shut out distractions and dismiss the naysayers, has created an insular operation struggling to do the outreach a presidential campaign requires. His stiff-arming of mainstream media has made it difficult to regain control of the narrative. And Trump's political rise would seem to show that policy, substance, and governing experience may not count for much in today's GOP.\n\nBut those who have had a front-row seat to DeSantis' transformation of his state know better than to underestimate him. In his presidential run, allies say, will draw on his Florida record to argue he is both more effective and more electable than Trump. To GOP partisans hungry for confrontation but weary of losing, he offers Trumpian aggressiveness without all the baggage. \"What got him here isn't personality, it isn't gladhanding,\" says Iarossi. \"It's the relentless pursuit of conservative policies that have made Floridians' lives better and led to a majority of registered Republicans. It's the result of policies and governing.\" - With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Julia Zorthian\n\nWrite to Molly Ball/Tallahassee at molly.ball@time.com"

      "text": "Inside Ron DeSantis' Final Push in Iowa\n\nI 'm standing so close to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that I can see each snowflake land in his perfectly-combed hair.\n\nThanks to a blizzard warning, DeSantis, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and the operation of former President Donald Trump have all scrapped their planned schedules. DeSantis, however, has still made it through the unplowed streets to his team's Urbandale Get Out the Vote office and is now addressing a clutch of cameras. He keeps his hands firmly holstered in his jean pockets as he talks about how well organized his team is and how he knows his supporters will make it out to vote Monday, despite the record cold temperature . And when it comes to the fact that Trump skipped this week's debate, he grows animated.\n\n\"I had people come up to me in the press with the debate saying, you know, 'You didn't go after Trump in the debate,'\" DeSantis says. \"That is not true. Like, if you watch the debate, I hit him on BLM. I hit him on not building the wall, the debt, not draining the swamp, Fauci, all those things. But it's different for me to just be doing that to a camera, versus him being right there.\" Indeed, those hits have not come close to knocking Trump out of first place. The final NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll, released Saturday, shows Trump with 48% of the vote, followed by Haley at 20% and DeSantis at 16%. If such a margin came to pass, it would mark a sore letdown for the governor, who has focused much of his campaign in the Hawkeye State.\n\nBut if DeSantis seems to be struggling in polls or televised debates, up close in Iowa the size and dedication of his organization, his commitment to campaigning and the passion of his conservative devotees presents a different picture. As he barnstorms the state in the final hours before caucus night, the governor is counting on that discipline, combined with lowered expectations, to deliver a surprise Monday night. Asked on CNN Sunday morning if a third place finish would mark the end of his campaign, DeSantis refused to entertain the possibility. \"We're going to do well on Monday,\" he said. \"Our voters are very motivated. This is-I think it's very hard to poll an Iowa caucus, period... There's a lot of excitement on the ground. We're in this for the long haul.\"\n\nI see some of that excitement in Urbandale, where two dozen or so supporters making calls while they snack on charcuterie roar upon DeSantis' arrival. \"4 Days Until the Iowa Caucus\" declares a handwritten poster on the wall, which also includes the wifi network name: \"nhdoesntcorrectit,\" a dig at a suggestion Haley made in New Hampshire that voters there will choose the right nominee even if Iowans don't. Many of the volunteers here have flown in from out of state to help this man, and they appear thrilled to spend time with him and his surrogates. About an hour after the press conference, a volunteer from Texas who I'm interviewing pauses when he sees Bob Vander Plaats, perhaps the state's most important evangelical kingmaker, walk through the door. \"That was a goal of mine, to be able to shake his hand,\" the volunteer says.\n\nMeanwhile, the governor and the first lady are posted up in a side room. Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, two DeSantis endorsers, eat tacos while talking to some supporters, and the governor's mom, who still lives in the same house he grew up in, chats with others. Little girls in cheerleading costumes race around the office. The building is buzzing with conversation, a stark contrast to the silent snowfall outside.\n\nThe next day, as temperatures fall but snow doesn't, I join DeSantis back on the campaign trail with Never Back Down, the Super PAC supporting him. The group says it has knocked on over 940,000 doors in the state since last year. First up is a stop at an event hall in Council Bluffs, a town on Iowa's Western border across the Missouri River from Omaha. Many in the crowd are Republican fans from Nebraska, but at least a few are undecided Iowans. \"A lot of neighbors have Trump flags,\" says part time public school employee Theresa Tsubaki, a local who's deciding between DeSantis and Trump. \"But you know, I think some people are open-minded too.\"\n\nThe crowd appears to love the governor's right-wing message. He earns applause and cheers when he talks about beating Disney \"and making sure that the transgenderism is not allowed in our schools.\" There's more applause when he talks about reviewing tenured professors and fighting ESG. Sometimes, when people clap, DeSantis looks down as if he doesn't expect it. The encouragement continues as he slams his opponents. The crowd cackles when he says, \"I had to debate the other night on CNN, with Hillary-I mean-Nikki.\" When he adds, \"She really represents kind of the warmed-over corporatist strain of the Republican establishment,\" I see Reynolds nodding along vigorously. Then, he goes after the frontrunner. \"Trump said drain the swamp, and I agreed with that. The problem is he didn't drain it,\" DeSantis says, and the audience yells out in agreement. A few minutes later, he touts the \"Don't Fauci My Florida\" T-shirts he sold during the pandemic and adds, \"The Fauci-Trump policies were the wrong policies. ... Me, as President of the United States, you know, I represent a wall of safety for you, because I will never let that happen to this country ever again.\" The audience goes wild.\n\nI arrive late at the next stop in Atlantic for another town hall-style event in a Victorian era historic building. Two Suburbans pull up while I cross the snowy street. Vander Plaats hurries in ahead of me. But when I go to squeeze inside, there's a hubbub near the entrance. I stand against the door as a burly security guard pushes a man past me. I see he's holding a token that serves as a reminder of DeSantis' long odds: a little gold trophy printed with the word \"Participation.\"\n\nThe program here is much abbreviated, with DeSantis' surrogates rattling off their remarks and the Governor taking questions within minutes. As he wraps up, he shakes a few hands and hurries out to his car. His wife and Reynolds stick around a little longer, standing close to attendees who they greet like old friends. Still, the visit seems to have served its purpose. Ron Russell, who works in education, tells me at first he's deciding between Haley and DeSantis, but as we talk, his pick seems to solidify. \"I'm tending to think in the DeSantis direction, actually,\" he says. \"He pointed out his willingness to travel through 99 counties of Iowa, including in a blizzard, and I appreciate that. I think I agree with almost everything he stands for. I'm just processing which candidate would be most likely to be able to win.\"\n\nAn hour and a half later, back at Never Back Down headquarters, the room is packed so tight I can barely move. They're distributing cards that say \"DeSantis Solves Problems\" and, in smaller print \"With No Drama.\" A sign on a staffer's door declares \"Your Preference is Not My Probelm\" (sic). After DeSantis arrives, I can see him grinning. The office is crawling with young members of his team in DeSantis-branded winter gear. They make their way in and out of a corner blocked off \"for political staff only.\" Some of his longtime friends from Yale are also here supporting him.\n\nI find two of them, including California attorney Mike McClellan, on their way out. McClellan says that about a dozen of the college buddies have been fundraising for the governor and several of them have been out knocking doors here in the snow. McClellan says the two talk once a week, about sports and family. The governor asks his friends for a pulse check on different areas of the country; they urge him to keep pushing for conservative legislation. He updates them about the campaign. \"Whether there's been some media story about, you know, process or drama with personnel or whatever it is, none of that has ever affected his unwavering commitment to be the president that he believes America needs to stand up for our values,\" says McClellan of their private talks.\n\nI ask McClellan the same question DeSantis responded to on CNN: Would DeSantis stay in the race if he came in third in Iowa? \"I think he absolutely would stay in the race,\" he says. \"I think no matter what happens, he's getting on a plane and heading to New Hampshire to campaign on Tuesday. I think Ron DeSantis can beat Nikki Haley in South Carolina. It's a conservative state. He's way more conservative than she is. But I also don't for a moment believe that we're going to come in third.\"\n\nIndeed, even if the Iowa poll shows that Haley is edging out DeSantis, it also shows weakness in her voters' enthusiasm: only 9% say they are extremely enthusiastic to caucus for her. But there's still Trump to contend with. He's been dominating throughout the race, sometimes polling above 50%. Even DeSantis' supporters, though hopeful, concede that winning Iowa outright is a long shot. \"I think people need to understand that it's about turnout, about persuasion,\" says Rep. Roy. \"At the end of the day, you know, whether he does or doesn't, the question is, is 'Can President Trump crack 50?'\"\n\nThat's a very different benchmark than the one set by Trump's team, which has framed any margin of victory greater than 13 points as a success . Roy's comment suggests that even if Trump trounces the governor, if fewer voters back Trump than don't, DeSantis will continue on as if he can upset the former President. He has meet and greets scheduled for the day after the Iowa caucuses in both South Carolina and New Hampshire.\n\nFor now, DeSantis and his surrogates head west to Davenport. I loiter in the front of the office, where about a dozen volunteers are sitting around making calls. One of them is Rob Owen, a landscape architect and a DeSantis precinct captain back in Urbandale. His involvement with the campaign speaks to the depth of the operation; he decided to work on the governor's behalf after he responded to the team's text with some thoughts about the Constitution and a young person on the team invited him to a two-hour coffee.\n\nOwen tells me he's still talking to a lot of voters who are undecided. He tells them about the governor's record and how he used to be a Trump supporter, as well. He talks about how he thinks if Trump becomes the nominee, the justice system will find a way to take him down before November. As for the polls? He doesn't buy them.\n\n\"The last four or five years we've, we've been gaslighted on everything,\" Owens says. \"I was just in the break room and got a piece of pizza and they've got all the media up there. And I saw CNN now showing Nikki Haley has moved up to 20% and DeSantis is 13. I don't buy that for a minute. We saw in '16. We saw in '20. We saw Governor DeSantis, last time, it was supposed to be a narrow margin and he absolutely obliterated his opponent. So will we win? I don't know. I think he's going to have one heck of a showing.\"\n\nAfter months of tumbling in the polls, he'd better. With hours to go before caucusing starts, this is it: DeSantis' last big chance to cash in on his ground game and get his candidacy off the ground.\n\nWrite to Mini Racker at mini.racker@time.com"

      "text": "No One Is Talking About What Ron DeSantis Has Actually Done to Florida\n\nM edia coverage of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's all-but-announced candidacy for president is already in full frenzy, and so far the script is exactly as his handlers would like it to be. The governor regularly opens up new fronts in the culture wars, sowing alarm over critical race theory, transgender rights, or border policies. In response, liberal pundits fall into the trap of accentuating the very issues DeSantis has chosen to fire up his base.\n\nOmitted from the public debate about DeSantis's policies is almost any discussion of his actual record of governance-what exactly he has delivered to the citizens of his state, especially those without seven-figure incomes and lush investment portfolios.\n\nEven a cursory dip into the statistics of social and economic well-being reveals that Florida falls short in almost any measure that matters to the lives of its citizens. More than four years into the DeSantis governorship, Florida continues to languish toward the bottom of state rankings assessing the quality of health care , school funding , long-term elder care , and other areas key to a successful society.\n\nFlorida may be the place where \"woke goes to die\"-as DeSantis is fond of saying-but it is also where teachers' salaries are among the lowest in the nation, unemployment benefits are stingier than in any other state, and wage theft flourishes with little interference from the DeSantis administration. In 2021, DeSantis campaigned against a successful ballot initiative to raise the state's minimum wage, which had been stuck at $8.65 an hour. Under DeSantis's watch, the Sunshine State has not exactly been a workers' paradise.\n\nDeSantis weaponizes the cultural wars to distract attention from the core missions of his governorship, which is to starve programs geared toward bettering the lives of ordinary citizens so he can maintain low taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Florida is the ideal haven for privileged Americans who don't want to pay their fair share of taxes. It has no income tax for individuals, and its corporate tax rate of 5.5% is among the lowest in the nation. An investigation by the Orlando Sentinel in late 2019 revealed the startling fact that 99% of Florida's companies paid no corporate income tax , abetted by tax-avoidance schemes and state officials who gave a low priority to enforcing tax laws.\n\nThis is a pattern that shows up in the statistics of many Republican-led states, which on average commit fewer dollars per-capita to health care , public education , and other crucial services compared to their blue counterparts, while making sure corporations and wealthy individuals are prioritized for tax relief. Arizona cut taxes every year between 1990 and 2019, following up with a shift to a flat tax this year that will cost its budget $1.9 billion . Meanwhile, its public-school spending ranks 48 among the 50 states .\n\nIn Florida, the state's tax revenues come largely through sales and excise taxes, which fall hardest on the poor and middle class. A 2018 study by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Florida had the third least-equitable tax system of the 50 states. In the state's \"upside-down\" tax structure, the poorest 20% of Florida families paid 12.7% of their income in taxes, while the families whose income was in the top 4% paid 4.5%, and the top 1% paid 2.3%, according to the study.\n\nFlorida taxpayers get less for their money than residents of many other states. The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health-care systems globally, found in its 2022 \"scorecard\" that Florida had the 16th worst health care among the 50 states. It's no wonder that Florida ranks below the northern blue states in life expectancy and rates of cancer death , diabetes , fatal overdoses , teen birth rates , and infant mortality .\n\nLargely because of DeSantis's obstinacy, Florida is one of 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an act of political spite that has cost those states billions in federal health care dollars and cost thousands of people their lives. More than 12% of Floridians are without medical insurance, a worse record than all but four other states . Despite having the country's highest percentage of retirees, Florida has the worst long-term care among the 50 states, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.\n\nPublic schools fare no better than health care in DeSantis's Florida. Not only did Florida rank 49th in the country for average teacher pay in 2020, but the Education Law Center, a non-profit advocacy group based in New Jersey, found in a 2021 report that the state had the seventh-lowest per-pupil funding in the country. Education Week, which ranks states public school annually, looking beyond mere test scores, placed Florida 23rd in its 2021 report, a lackluster showing for a large and wealthy state.\n\nIt says something about the state of our political discourse that Florida's denuded public sector was not more of an issue in last year's gubernatorial campaign. In endorsing DeSantis's Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, the Tampa Bay Times spent so many column inches on the incumbent's demagoguery, vindictiveness, and authoritarian tendencies that it never even got to the minutiae of his governance. \"No matter what you think about the state of the Florida economy or its schools or its future...,\" the paper wrote, \"the choice really is this simple: Do you want the state governed by a decent man or a bully?\"\n\nTo be fair to the media, DeSantis and his allies manned the trenches of the culture wars so ferociously that it was all reporters could do to keep up with all the bomb throwing. How do you delve into the state's tax policy when your governor is flying planeloads of migrants to Martha's Vineyard or declaring war on Disney for issuing a statement in opposition to the state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay Law\"?\n\nBut that is very much the point of wedge issues, as they have been wielded by scurrilous politicians for decades, to anger and distract voters so they won't notice the actions of public officials that mainly benefit the wealthy and are against the public interest.\n\nAs the 2024 election draws closer, DeSantis must not be allowed to accomplish nationally what he did in his state-cloak his service to the wealthy by frightening working people with stories about transgender recruiting and \"socialist\" college professors. There are unmistakable signs that Americans are focused on what an activist government can do for the public good, as evidenced by Floridians' vote to increase the minimum wage.\n\nThe failure of DeSantis to better serve the most vulnerable citizens of his state is his weak underbelly in a national campaign.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "In Iowa, Ron DeSantis Takes His Loss as a Win\n\nF or the first time in a long time, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was being fêted as a winner, and he hadn't even won .\n\nAs he took the stage in the Sheraton ballroom, the Iowa crowd thundered his name and pounded the floor. \"We love you!\" someone yelled. \"We love you, too,\" he said.\n\nThe news was just breaking that DeSantis had been called as the second-place finisher in the state, only slightly ahead of former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. And that was good enough for him.\n\n\"You helped us get a ticket punched out of the Hawkeye State,\" he said. \"We have a lot of work to do, but I can tell you this: As the next President of the United States, I am going to get the job done for this country.\"\n\nThe result means that the DeSantis campaign will continue into New Hampshire and beyond. After the governor poured almost all his resources into Iowa, and appeared to be going nowhere fast in the other early voting states, he needed a strong showing here to give him the momentum to carry on.\n\n\"Anyone on the ground here would have told you Donald Trump is gonna win the caucus,\" Jimmy Centers, an Iowa-based Republican consultant, told TIME Monday afternoon. \"The race is for the second-place finish. If he gets second, no matter what the margin is, he did his job.\"\n\nSecond was good enough to punch his ticket, but it may be a ticket to nowhere.\n\nDeSantis hit one mark that he had to: not coming in third. But he fell short elsewhere. Some of his surrogates suggested he had a chance to win outright, and others anchored expectations for a Trump success at the sky-high threshold of 50% . Trump ended up surpassing that, a victory even on his rivals' terms. DeSantis is walking away with almost the same number of delegates as Haley. And he has no reason to expect better results in the next few early voting states. According to FiveThirtyEight's polling average, DeSantis is barely in the running in New Hampshire, clocking in below 6% support, with Trump over 40% and Haley earning around 30%. He's doing only a little better in South Carolina: 12%, to Trump's 55% and Haley's 25%. His path to the nomination remains unclear.\n\nWhat is clear is that he'll be sticking around to forge it. His campaign pointed to his speech as its statement on the results and his plans going forward, with stops scheduled Tuesday in New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nBased on the reaction at DeSantis' watch party, his fans didn't need much more. They roared when right-wing radio talk show host Steve Deace said, \"It's a two person race now. Iowa has made that very clear. There is no place for the last gasp of the Republican corporatist establishment, Nikki Haley.\" They bellowed when Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said, \"He's in it for the long haul. He's ready to keep going. ... We're sending him to New Hampshire. We're sending him to South Carolina. Watch out, America, Ron DeSantis is not done.\"\n\nWaving signs that read \"God Over Government\" and \"Don't Mess With My Kids,\" DeSantis' most ardent supporters really seemed to believe he is going to be the next President of the United States.\n\nBut as they left the party, attendees became more measured. \"Historically, you got to either get first or second in Iowa to win the nomination,\" said Luke Posegate, a 22-year-old DeSantis volunteer. \"I would have liked to have a little bit better scoreboard. I had hoped that the margin of victory would have been a little bit closer between President Trump and Governor DeSantis.\"\n\nPosegate added that he thinks DeSantis' path to the nomination involves Trump getting kicked off the ballot when he's convicted on criminal charges. He added that he was proud that the governor had lost to Trump by only two votes at the caucus location where Posegate had spoken on DeSantis' behalf.\n\nHours earlier, another nearby caucus site, Eternity Church, seemed representative of the way Monday's results would go and the governor's challenges going forward. Outside, supporters had stuck both DeSantis and Trump signs in the snow. Inside Trump caucus captains wore their white and gold hats, while DeSantis volunteers in neon orange handed out fans. Given the former President's firm support in many rural areas and the governor's middling success in the evangelical northwest, DeSantis needed to do well in population centers just like this. According to data from the Des Moines Register , voters there ultimately went ever-so-slightly for Trump.\n\nUntil about a month ago, hospice nurse Audrey Scott thought she'd be supporting the governor. But seeing his campaign flame out recently, she changed her mind. \"I was DeSantis because I felt Trump-I just got annoyed with all of his words and calling people nicknames,\" she said. \"But you need someone that's strong and relentless, that's going to just take all the crap that he takes and be able to still move his agenda forward. So I feel like DeSantis is a little bit more quiet and might not have the strength to challenge what we need him to challenge.\"\n\nShe also ended up preferring Trump's more-direct style. \"I feel like DeSantis just has vague answers, more political, whereas Trump just says it the way it is,\" she said. \"I'm blunt. I like that he's blunt.\"\n\nEven likely DeSantis voters sounded lukewarm. Leslie Peterson, a commercial lending banker at Eternity Church, said just before the caucus began that she was \"kind of leaning towards DeSantis.\" What did she like about him? \"That he's not Trump,\" she said. But even then, minutes before the caucus began, the woman who called DeSantis \"a strong leader\" and \"a family man\" and said of Trump, \"I just don't like him as a person,\" would not rule out lining up behind the former President.\n\n\"If the state's gonna back him as our Republican candidate, then I'll go with it,\" she relented.\n\nAfter seeing Trump's dominance Monday night, the rest of the country might just go with it, too.\n\nWrite to Mini Racker / West Des Moines, Iowa at mini.racker@time.com"

      "text": "Florida's Environmental Failures Are a Warning for the Rest of the U.S.\n\nFloridian Jeff VanderMeer is a New York Times -bestselling novelist whose articles have appeared in the New York Times , Los Angeles Times , Esquire , and The Nation .\n\nE arly in the 20th century, engineers blew up waterfalls and rapids in Miami rivers to clear the way for a canal. Wildcats scattered and fish floated to the surface, paralyzed. As legend has it, at least one alligator's body went flying in the explosion , gawked at by local dignitaries.\n\nDynamite and dredging were the tools chosen to drain the Everglades and tame the waters. What once belonged to the Tequesta Native Americans, amid a wealth of wildlife, became parking lots and hotels owned by white people. Today, many of those parking lots are submerged during storms and, in some areas, the hotels overlook waters toxic with industrial and construction waste .\n\nFlorida is a bellwether for the rest of the nation; the surge water rise that besets Miami today will, soon enough, beset states ranging from California to New York . The state, of necessity, should be a leader in U.S. climate resiliency. But rather than acknowledge a crisis and build out a holistic approach to climate change, Florida, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, denies the urgency and applies a hodge-podge of contradictory initiatives designed for short-term applause. Some come with large amounts of money attached, while the state simultaneously ignores the peril of poorly regulated industrial-scale farming, ranching, and development that intensifies the crisis.\n\nRuinous policy in Florida affects 11 million acres of wetlands, thousands of lakes, more than 1,300 miles of coastline, and hundreds of freshwater springs. From rock pine to salt marsh, from sandhill scrub to lush semi-tropical ravines and dozens of other unique ecosystems-the point lost on DeSantis and the Republican legislature is that these are not tourist sights housed in an amusement park, but vital parts of the actual world that humans occupy and need to thrive, perhaps even to survive.\n\nYet, even as he pivots to a presidential run, DeSantis continues to downplay the risks of climate change.\n\nAsked about hurricanes and climate change during a FOX News interview on May 24, DeSantis said he \" rejects the politicization of the weather, \" echoing his 2022 statement that \"I can't control the climate. I'm not doing mandates on any of that.\"\n\nThat same day, the Sierra Club gave DeSantis an F for his environmental record, citing, in part, his attitude toward climate change and general \"mismanagement.\" Florida lags behind many states with decades-old energy efficiency guidelines while a recent DeSantis line-item budget veto disqualified Florida from receiving $346 million in federal funds from a program meant to improve energy efficiency across the country. DeSantis also signed legislation taking clean energy decisions away from local government; has yet to ban certain kinds of fracking ; allowed exploratory oil drilling in the ecological sensitive Apalachicola River Basin; and, despite 2018 campaign promises, failed to lodge an objection to recent federal permits allowing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .\n\nMismanagement, in this case, compromises the future of a state that has the fourth-largest economy in the U.S. and 14th largest economy in the world, just above Mexico. (In response to a detailed list of questions sent to the DeSantis team, a spokesperson did not respond directly to this or any other issue. Instead, they sent a list of monetary outlays for environmental issues made under the DeSantis administration.)\n\nThe stakes involved are not just the quality of life for Floridians, but actual lives-and the potential, as DeSantis exports his brand, that ecosystems nationwide will suffer from weakened regulation and be left for dead.\n\nIf Florida's wild places have evolved, with exceeding sophistication, to excel in a geographically fragile setting, then, in recent years, an opposite devolution has occurred politically in the human world.\n\nWhen former governor Rick Scott took office in 2011, the state's environmental regulation still supported some measure of sensible policy. But Scott had no vision for conservation, only an agenda beholden to aggressive business interests. This included dismantling good policy and banning use of the terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change,\" while stacking agencies, commissions, and departments with political appointees-many of whom lacked the qualifications necessary for the jobs, according to civil servants within state agencies who requested anonymity for fear of retribution-while forcing out scientists and other experts.\n\nDeSantis, on paper, looks better than his predecessor, but he hasn't rolled back Scott's bad decisions. The Department of Economic Opportunity Scott created -to replace a Department of Community Affairs devoted to sensible citizen-responsive land management decisions-continues, now as the Department of Commerce , to divide up Florida into economic zones that often end up helping extractive industries or huge developers. DeSantis also has accelerated the practice of politicizing appointees, based on campaign donations , even as he gives lip service to environmental issues.\n\nRecently, DeSantis announced billions of dollars for Everglades restoration, but the move may come with hidden political strings and calculations. Environmental analysts believe that some of the planned water projects may benefit large-scale agriculture more than the area's habitat and biodiversity. It will take time to track how the money flows and where, and how much becomes trapped in eddies and swirls of bureaucracy or lines the pockets of DeSantis donors.\n\nThe projects DeSantis has greenlit often lack the scope to fulfill lofty promises. The governor's \"crown jewel\" of Everglades restoration, the EAA Reservoir artificial wetlands project , allocates 16,500 acres for restoration-a pittance of the 60,000 acres stipulated in the Congressional Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan .\n\nIn the language of ecosystems, the reservoir has not evolved in a complex enough way to sustain itself over time. In the language of human policy, as Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, notes, \"Pumping record amounts of taxpayer money into earth-moving restoration projects will only be effective if these projects are properly scaled and designed to address Florida's water-quality and water-quantity needs.\"\n\nGood policy requires an integrated plan, including adequate staffing. Natural ecosystems are self-sustaining because they come \"fully staffed\" with the organisms that keep them running. In the human world, staffing should occur as a core principle of project management, especially in projects with hundreds of millions of dollars behind them. But experts believe that the EAA Reservoir and other new projects may actually force existing state employees, already spread thin, to be pulled from maintenance of other essential projects.\n\nFor all of these reasons, there may not be an EAA Reservoir in a hundred years, even if rare ghost orchids still bloom in the area. This hasn't stopped DeSantis from pointing to Everglades restoration as a reason to call him the \"Teddy Roosevelt\" of conservation-despite overruling a judge's findings to support a Miami-Dade County highway extension that would encroach on important wetlands and endangered panther habitat. The loss of wetlands for projects like highways signifies the loss of sophistication and complexity in landscapes. A road means the poisoning of surrounding groundwater by toxins from tires, pollution of the air from fuel emissions, and untold numbers of organisms hit or run over by cars-for decades.\n\nWetlands are happy places because they provide space for so much biodiversity that the ground, air, and water cannot be anything but utterly alive. The loss of voices in wetlands is the loss of leopard frogs croaking and spring peepers chirping, the thready morse code of marsh wrens, the throaty roar of alligators during mating season, the whirring brittle sound of many species of dragonfly, with names like clubtails , darners , and red saddleback .\n\nYet these habitats also mitigate flooding, filter out human-made pollutants, provide buffers from storms, and are so essential to resiliency that when removed the state may, as in the Everglades, spend billions of dollars to restore the positive effects it once enjoyed for free.\n\nIn Florida, almost everything but uplands and rock pine habitat is some kind of wetlands, and subject to the rule and generosity of water.\n\nThe dismantling of wetlands is in a sense the dismantling of Florida itself.\n\nIf solid ground is an illusion in Florida, so too is the political landscape, especially for the average citizen. Neglect, greed, and business interests are regularly privileged, and sometimes even celebrated, over the rights of communities.\n\nUnder Scott and now in cascading ways under DeSantis, a host of preemption bills have stripped self-rule from local governments and made it easy to cut down trees, pollute, and subvert regulation. On May 24, DeSantis signed a bill, SB 540 , overwhelmingly opposed by environmental groups, that makes it difficult for citizens to legally oppose changes to county comprehensive plans-often amended because of pressure from developers, now emboldened.\n\nSamples calls it \"a death knell\" for smart growth in Florida that undermines resiliency and contradicts DeSantis' own Executive Orders 19-12 and 23-06, 2019 Executive Order 23-06 , which supported safeguards for responsible long-term planning. \"Citizens were the last line of defense against unchecked sprawl,\" says Samples, \"and SB 540 has effectively stripped Floridians of our ability to challenge environmentally damaging, legally flawed projects that encroach on waterways, wetlands and green spaces.\"\n\nIn June, DeSantis also signed into law SB 170 , which allows businesses to sue local governments over so-called \"arbitrary or unreasonable\" laws, and SB 718 , which prohibits voter referendums of ballot initiatives on land development regulation. Samples notes that these laws \"defy logic,\" in that \"lawmakers in Tallahassee like to talk about the importance of 'home rule'-then they undercut it year after year, to the detriment of our natural environment.\"\n\nIt's hard to ignore an investigative report published by the Daytona Beach News- Journal, that found 4 1 % of state legislators have real estate ties -while these same lawmakers loudly proclaim that this fact has no effect on their votes.\n\nIntensifying the potential damage, many special interests on the developer side are often companies that prefer to use prefabricated designs ill-suited for Florida's unique topography. Decades ago, with better tree-protection ordinances, it was not out of the ordinary for a house in the capital city of Tallahassee to be carefully constructed around a massive live oak or even a mighty pine-with surrounding urban forest used as flooding and erosion mitigation. Yet now, new development tends to place expensive houses or apartment complexes cheek by jowl in ways that destroy biodiversity by cutting down most trees, removing the soil down to the clay, and filling in natural stormwater mitigation features in favor of holding ponds that do not effectively filter pollution.\n\nParts of Florida fade into invisibility every day, without being much chronicled, given over to a secret history of loss. Large patches of sky-blue lupine , a once common and dramatic sight in dry uplands, are disappearing due to development. Lupine often die if transplanted. Teams of volunteers rescuing native plants from future sites of clearcutting in Central Florida must leave these deep-rooted plants to their fate, sometimes lamenting as well the presence of gopher tortoises who also cannot flee , and sometimes end up being killed in the name of development.\n\nSuch places have intrinsic value and integrity. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), biodiversity annually contributes $125 to $140 trillion worldwide to economies and communities that extend to wildlife the basic right to life and land.\n\nFlorida does try to preserve wild places, if sometimes with one hand tied behind its back. Environmental nonprofits do heroic work under incredible pressures and the Florida Forever state program saves habitat and has played a role in the successful fight for 17.7 million acres for conservation in a much-lauded and valuable Florida Wildlife Corridor .\n\nBut the Act that established the corridor does not say wildlife and ecosystems have an intrinsic right to exist or inherent value-nor does it implement much in the way of legal protections. Instead, the Act uses vague language like \"encourage\" and \"consider\"-a stance that has practical impacts, magnified by the way DeSantis tends to reward his donors and supporters.\n\nThe corridor gives monetary incentives to large rural landowners, many of whom employ their own publicists to lobby for Corridor status. That includes Lykes Brothers, which owns vast tracts of ranch and agricultural land in Florida that stand to benefit-even as Mallory Lykes Dimmitt, Lykes Brothers' former vice president of strategic development serves as head of the Corridor project . As early as 2003, Lykes Brothers received conservation easement benefits for Glades County property while retaining the right to use the land, to \"drill for oil and gas, subdivide the area into 22 farms, [and] spray pesticides,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nRecently, Lykes Brothers received Corridor conservation money from the state for 6,800-acres of company-owned land-even though 2,500 of those acres (roughly 25%) are being used for intensive agriculture in the form of eucalyptus and pine plantation and will remain Lykes Brothers property. This interpretation of \"conservation\" is, it seems, made possible by the Act's vague wording. No studies have been done to determine how much other Corridor acreage may consist of similar parcels. (Lykes Brothers did not respond to TIME's questions about the Corridor status of land owned by the company.)\n\nWorse, a recent change to the legislation that determines how Wildlife Corridor status is granted means that landowners in the 75,000-acre southwest Florida Big Cypress conservation area will have a decade after their land is bought by the government to continue grazing cows, harvesting timber, and farming. On top of that, they will have the option to apply for two more five-year extensions. In other words, former owners could profit from the sale of their land at full market value-and then spend 20 more years profiting off the land before actually turning it over to conservation efforts.\n\nThis legislative loophole weakening the Wildlife Corridor joins another introduced in 2021 through the state budget that means owners of Corridor conservation land can receive additional money by having their wetlands serve as mitigation habitat for nearby wetlands destroyed by developers. Similar to disingenuous models of carbon offset, this means no actual additional conservation land is being set aside for the countless species that need it, from panthers and black bears to scrub jays and gopher tortoises.\n\nCan wildlife afford to live in Florida? If wildlife can't, how can we?\n\nMuch of the national environmental reporting on DeSantis has been \"flat-out wrong,\" according to Julie Hauserman, a long-time Florida journalist and activist. She says the media has been taken in by \"greenwashing,\" which leverages environmental concern to create the appearance of positive action.\n\n\"So many reporters wanted to hang the 'Republican environmental' label [on] him that was a fiction,\" Hauserman says. \"This take...surprised us all. His PR folks were relentless and very effective creating the narrative. You'll see DeSantis in a windbreaker waving from a boat promising to save the environment and he gets on the local TV news. Most people don't pay attention to the details.\"\n\nThe governor's version of greenwashing often takes on a particular form: money allocated, words spoken...and then results that may have little to do with either.\n\nConsider DeSantis' vaunted resilience program to protect Florida's coast against sea level rise. In 2019, DeSantis hired Julia Nesheiwat as \"Chief Resilience Officer\" to head up that effort, but she left only six months later. \"Florida needs a statewide strategy,\" Nesheiwat concluded at the end of her tenure . \"Communities are overwhelmed and need one place to turn for guidance.\" The implication was that, despite the resiliency program, the \"one place\" does not exist, except, perhaps, in the governor's office.\n\nDeSantis wasted nearly two years before appointing a new, very experienced resiliency officer, Wesley Brooks, in December of 2021 , but Floridians have heard almost nothing from him since. The rudderless policy on this issue continues, including a number of possibly counterproductive sea wall solutions for coastlines while efforts to enshrine effective natural solutions, like mangrove buffers, have died in legislative committee .\n\nKim Ross, executive director of ReThink Energy Florida, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting clean energy, doubts funding put toward sea level rise is even enough. \"And the longer this goes on, the more properties are impacted,\" she says. \"This impacts property values, which impacts the property taxes the counties and state have [to fund.]\" It's what she describes as \"a cycle spiraling downward.\"\n\nWorse, the state fails to recognize the truth enshrined in its own Visit Florida tourism brochures: No matter where you go, \"you're never more than 60 miles from the nearest body of salt water.\"\n\nAs Ross notes, sea walls will be inadequate because the king tides in southeast Florida \"come in from the intercoastal waterways and the drains. So, the beaches are fine, but farther inland is flooded. Parts of our interior are going to impacted by sea level rise.\"\n\nOne third of Florida properties live under threat of flooding of some kind , according to a CBS News report, with many residents lacking adequate insurance.\n\nBy June 9 of this year, Miami had spent 892.6 hours above mean high tide averages -over 100 hours more than during any other year on record.\n\nOn June 15 DeSantis vetoed millions in the 2023 budget for flood control in South and Central Florida.\n\nResiliency aside, DeSantis also hasn't addressed Scott's prior assault on Florida's water quality. Today, the state has some of the most polluted lakes in the country . A 2022 investigation by the TC Palm revealed that DeSantis-era water policies are not working -and that many of the changes proposed by DeSantis in 2019 never actually happened. Even if, as Ross puts it, \"Rick Scott set the bar really, really low,\" the lack of results is hard to spin as sound environmental stewardship.\n\nEvery year, migrating white pelicans touch down in thousands of ponds in Florida, some meant to hold stormwater surge and (inadequately) protect against pollution. Every year, local newspapers report proudly on the grand spectacle of these large birds, but do not report on how rife with fertilizer and herbicide these waters may be, or that, in many cases, the same natural lake the pelicans once foraged in may now, as in the capital of Tallahassee, be treated as a dumping grounds for pollutants . This is the everyday reality in Florida.\n\nDeSantis also has presided over a disastrous handover of control of federal wetlands in Florida from the federal government to the state. \"Florida went from a highly regulated application process...to one managed by a short-staffed, underfunded, and untrained unit processing a record number of applications it cannot keep up with,\" the Orlando Sentinel reported , underscoring the issue of staffing in program success.\n\nCompounding the problem, water sources in Florida are so interconnected that the recent Supreme Court decision that weakened protections of certain kinds of wetlands under the Clean Water Act doesn't just give a green light to further destroy these vital places. It may also provide cover or give an excuse for other types of environmental degradation, like those resulting from toxic fertilizer byproducts-an area where DeSantis's record is particularly disastrous.\n\nRun-off from phosphate-based fertilizer is a source of pollution that destroys ecosystems, including wetlands, and the food both people and wildlife depend on from those sources. Much of that destruction occurs because fertilizer feeds elevated levels of blue-green algae (freshwater) and the algae that causes red tide (saltwater). Both blue-green algae and red tide cause a host of health problems. This year, a red tide bloom encroached on South Florida that created breathing problems, rashes, and red eyes for humans-while marine life, including sea turtles, died off by the thousands.\n\nYet DeSantis is so committed to protecting the \"lifecycle\" of phosphate-to-fertilizer over water quality that this year he signed into a law a line item in the budget that makes it impossible for local governments to enact new bans or limits on fertilizer use, until completion of a study on fertilizer's effects urged by fertilizer companies. He also signed a bill to research radioactive phosphate byproducts for use in building roads (currently banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). New research indicates that the DeSantis-approved release of 215 million gallons of contaminated wastewater from an abandoned phosphate mine into Tampa Bay in 2021-the \" Piney Point Wastewater Disaster \"-polluted the coast for miles and likely contributed to the intensity of red tide algae blooms in the region soon after the event.\n\nProtecting business interests over human health also has had catastrophic impacts on attempts to reduce blue-green algae flowing south from Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades. In June of this year, the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science reported that more than 60% of Lake Okeechobee (some 448 square miles) was covered in algae blooms. Lake Okeechobee's plight has also had a major detrimental impact on the formerly rich Indian River Lagoon ecosystems .\n\nDeSantis created task force committees to address both types of algae, but to little effect. The governor has implemented only 13% of the recommendations from his blue-green algae task force. His red tide task force has reached the conclusion that red tide is bad and getting worse, but remained vague as to causes that would point toward the practices of industrial agriculture.\n\n\"So far, DeSantis' tenure has looked different than Scott's,\" Samples says. \"It's about a lack of follow-through.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Florida's canaries in the coal mine-manatees, the gentle herbivores of the river systems-are starving to death by the thousands, largely in the imperiled Indian River Lagoon area, due to the death of the staple of their diet, sea grasses, a symptom of the state's environmental health. Few things in this world are more wholesome than a manatee and her calf floating effortlessly while grazing, yet this iconic symbol of Florida's wildlife has been replaced by the image of the shrunken husks of the dead washed up on lifeless shores.\n\nVarious non-governmental organizations focus their attention on restoring sea grasses while the state ignores addressing root causes of the die-off, which include the same widespread water contamination that fuels red tide and blue-green algae blooms. Much of the sea grass being restored will die off again. Despite hundreds of properties around Lake Okeechobee violating state water pollution phosphorus limits, the state has imposed no penalties, the TCPalm found.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation continues to feed lettuce to manatees as a short-term solution. The FFWC website, perversely, continues to update the ever-lower population numbers while noting that the population \"has grown.\"\n\nThis is a dysfunctional human ecosystem.\n\nA regular visitor to the North Florida ravine on the Garden of Eden trail near the Apalachicola River might bear witness over time not just to the ebb and flow of decay and renewal over the seasons, but how the natural creek at the bottom protects against flooding during thunderstorms. How, during times of drought, that same creek still flows and the wooded slopes remain cool, shaded. The intricacy of how tiny iridescent sweat bees have evolved to extract pollen from swamp asters and other flowers is not arbitrary.\n\nNor is the feeling of rightness at the dry lurch and uplift of emerging on a path out of a ravine to the over-wheeling ache of blue sky across which glides a swallowtail kite, fresh off migration, looking down on gnarled pines, gopher tortoises, sudden sand dunes, and the entire landscape of Florida with razor-sharp vision.\n\nNor are any of these details trivial to human survival in an age of climate crisis. Bastions of complex life-in Florida or elsewhere-support all life; devaluing them or destroying them is, ultimately, like jettisoning the greenhouse gardens from a starship headed to Mars.\n\nBut a better future for Florida isn't rocket science. It just requires wise governance that leads with actual science and best practices, while halting desecration of the state's wild places. Resurrecting tools and processes that have been watered down or done away with over the past two Republican gubernatorial administrations would, in part, suffice, along with the vision and compassion to understand that communities deserve support, not corporations.\n\nThe other key is using the kinds of circular economy strategies being adopted by cities like Boulder, Colo. and Charlotte, N.C., applied at a state level.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis' Latest Staff Shakeup Is Part of a Pattern\n\nR on DeSantis is looking for a fresh start. Last week, the Florida governor fired roughly a dozen staffers and offloaded two top aides to a pro-DeSantis super PAC, signaling a campaign reset amid an existential crisis: He's failed to meet fundraising goals, burned cash at an alarming clip, and has been faltering in the polls. If things don't turn around soon, there may be more layoffs, according to sources familiar with the matter, who say that donors are exasperated with the campaign's underwhelming performance thus far.\n\nYet the latest staff shakeup isn't an anomaly within the arc of DeSantis' career. It's part of a larger pattern of a politician who has struggled to maintain a core group of trusted advisers or loyal employees.\n\nDuring his five years in Congress, his office had one of the highest turnover rates in the House. No employed member from his victorious 2018 gubernatorial campaign team is working in a senior role on his 2024 presidential race . And things didn't change when he became governor. In his first term, he fired staffers with enough regularity that some formed an emotional support group, according to a 2021 Politico report. Now, DeSantis is shedding staff only two months into his bid to beat out former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.\n\nDeSantis' long history of staffing woes has been a red flag to some of the party's veteran hands. One prominent GOP operative in touch with DeSantis, who requested anonymity to speak freely, advised him last winter that he would struggle to compete at the national level without a cohesive campaign nucleus. \"I told him early on: In my lifetime, I've never watched someone win a major race-not a congressional race, but a major contested race-without being able to keep a team and trust the team,\" the source recounts to TIME.\n\nIt's a reason why that same Republican operative warned high-net-worth donors who were looking for an alternative to Trump against investing too heavily in DeSantis until they could see how he performed as a presidential candidate. \"People who were big players were thinking about giving 50 or 100 million dollars,\" the source says. \"I told them, 'You should stitch that in and see if he can make it more than six months with actual professionals in charge.'\"\n\nSince DeSantis formally entered the race in May through a glitch-riddled announcement on Twitter, he hasn't inspired more confidence. A national Reuters/Ipsos poll from last week has Trump leading him by a commanding 28-point margin. It comes as Trump's multiple criminal indictments have only appeared to endear him more to Republican primary voters.\n\nThe DeSantis camp is trying to reassure donors that it can turn things around. In private meetings with top contributors, they've said they believe adverse press coverage has hampered the campaign rollout and have vowed to embark on a new strategy.\n\n\"No matter how much the media and D.C. elites try to destroy Ron DeSantis, they can't change the fact that this is a two-man race for the nomination,\" the campaign's communications director Andrew Romeo tells TIME. \"Ron DeSantis is ready to prove the doubters wrong yet again and our campaign is prepared to execute on his vision for the Great American Comeback as we transition into the next phase of winning this primary and beating Joe Biden.\"\n\nYet those who've worked with the Florida governor before expect staff turnover to continue to plague his presidential bid. They say he has never been one to forge lasting emotional bonds with people who work for him. \"The same struggle that he has with voters, he has with staff,\" another Republican operative familiar with the DeSantis campaign operation tells TIME. \"When things start to sour, it's easy for staff to either leave on their own volition, or it's easy for the boss to ultimately cut staff loose. There are no personal connections there.\"\n\nOne person who has been at DeSantis' side through every campaign is his wife Casey, who has a heavy influence over his political strategy. That dynamic has led some to doubt that any staffing changes can truly reorient the campaign when it will always be the two of them calling the shots. \"His top advisor comes with the house,\" the source close to DeSantis says. \"It's his wife. There's no firing his spouse. The idea that DeSantis can do a reset is a complete fallacy.\"\n\nWhile early campaign issues are an ominous sign for DeSantis' 2024 presidential ambitions, there is some precedent for a Republican presidential candidate clinching the party's nomination after a major staff shakeup.\n\nIn July 2007, John McCain dropped two of his top political aides, at the same point of the 2008 presidential election cycle. \"The guy had run for president once already and still had to completely recalibrate,\" says Jon Seaton, who worked on George W. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign and McCain's 2008 bid. \"John McCain was kind of proof positive that a rocky rollout doesn't necessarily mean your campaign is doomed.\"\n\nBut there were also significant differences between the two primaries. McCain, a longtime Senator from Arizona, entered that race as the likely frontrunner, and neither of his main competitors-former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney-had anything resembling the loyalty of Trump's base. DeSantis, on the other hand, is going up against the most dominant force in GOP politics.\n\nPresidential campaigns inevitably face adversities and vicissitudes. That's why seasoned campaign veterans say a candidate needs people who have been through the trenches with them before. It's a source of consternation and confusion to Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant who worked on the 2018 DeSantis gubernatorial campaign, that no one from that team is part of his inner circle now. \"He will have nothing to do with anyone associated with that close, amazing victory,\" Ayres tells TIME. \"He will have nothing to do with the general consultant, the campaign manager, the financial consultant, neither one of the media firms, or the polling firm. Most of the time when politicians win races, especially when they're close, hard-fought races, they keep at least some members of the team that helped them win. But he basically will have nothing to do with any of them.\"\n\nIn that election, DeSantis beat his rival, Democrat Andrew Gillum, by roughly 30,000 votes. Trump and his team are quick to point out that DeSantis secured the nomination with Trump's endorsement months earlier. Now that he's running against the former President, Trump has called him \"ungrateful\" and a \"lousy candidate\" who only rose to the governor's mansion on his coattails.\n\nBut the challenge for DeSantis going forward may be whether he can re-introduce himself as a credible new standard bearer for a Republican Party that doesn't seem ready to move on from Trump.\n\n\"He's kind of already defined himself,\" the GOP operative who previously worked with DeSantis says. \"That's the tough part about where he is: He is very well known by our base. He's pre-defined. That doesn't leave him a lot of wiggle room to maneuver.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "These Are the Biggest Moments From Iowa's Ron DeSantis v. Nikki Haley Republican Debate\n\nF ive days before the first voters weigh in on the Republican presidential race in the Iowa caucuses, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley squared off in a one-on-one debate in Des Moines on Wednesday night.\n\nAs the candidates battled for second place in the Republican primary, they touched on a range of topics including foreign policy, immigration, government spending, and leadership.\n\nNotably absent from the debate stage was former President Donald Trump, the current frontrunner who once again opted out of the debate and instead appeared at a simultaneous town hall on Fox News.\n\nTrump emerged relatively unscathed during the debate, with DeSantis and Haley directing their most fervent critiques primarily at each other and labeling each other as liars, flip-floppers, and insufficient conservatives.\n\nBoth candidates still lag significantly behind Trump in Iowa, according to 538's polling averages , though Haley has recently experienced a moderate surge in the polls.\n\nHere are the highlights of the debate.\n\nThe debate kicked off with a fiery exchange between the two candidates, with DeSantis reiterating his accusation that Haley prioritizes the interests of her donors over the interests of the American people.\n\nDeSantis also attempted to forge a connection between Haley and Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 who has long been the subject of conservative backlash.\n\n\"We don't need another mealy-mouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote, then to get an office and to do her donors' bidding,\" he said, adding that Haley wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office.\n\nThe comparison is a line of attack that a pro-DeSantis Super PAC has been leaning into in recent weeks, though the New York Times factchecked many of the claims of similarities between Haley and Clinton as \"misleading.\"\n\n\"I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables,\" DeSantis said on Wednesday night. \"We don't need a candidate who's going to look down on Middle America.\"\n\nHaley shot back by accusing DeSantis of being jealous of her campaign's success and repeatedly lying in desperation. \"The more Ron DeSantis loses, the more he lies,\" she said, redirecting attention to a website her campaign created-DeSantisLies.com-that catalogs what she claims are DeSantis's biggest mistruths about his record and hers. (She ended up mentioning the website at least a dozen times throughout the debate.)\n\n\"He's upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding,\" Haley said of DeSantis, adding that she would call out his flip-flops and falsehoods throughout the night. \"Drake University,\" she warned, \"don't turn this into a drinking game because you will be overserved by the end of the night.\"\n\nThe candidates notably refrained from making appeals to supporters of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the never-Trump candidate who dropped out of the presidential race earlier in the day . Typically, when a candidate exits the presidential race, surviving contenders court the departed candidate's supporters-but the debate took an unusual turn when Haley and DeSantis both sidestepped a question about the recently departed Christie to talk instead about Trump.\n\nThe apparent omission may have left Christie supporters in a vacuum, as neither remaining candidate had a nice thing to say about the former candidate who centered his campaign on blocking Trump from becoming the Republican Party's nominee. Christie has not endorsed another candidate yet.\n\nBoth candidates were asked to weigh in on whether Trump has the character to be President again.\n\n\"I think he was the right President at the right time,\" Haley said of Trump, repeating a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail. She applauded certain aspects of his tenure but drew a sharp distinction between her leadership and his and criticized Trump's record on China and the national debt. \"His way is not my way,\" she said, but it's not personal, she insisted: \"I don't have vengeance. I don't have vendettas.\"\n\nDeSantis offered a more critical assessment of Trump's presidency, pointing to unfulfilled promises-from building a wall that Mexico would pay for to draining the swamp to holding Hillary Clinton accountable. \"I'm running because I'm the guy that's going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country,\" DeSantis said.\n\nLater, Haley took another swipe at Trump over his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when he urged his supporters to go to the U.S. Capitol while Congress was certifying Joe Biden's electoral victory. Haley called it a \"terrible day\" and said that Trump \"will have to answer for it,\" adding that Biden did indeed win the presidency. (Trump is currently facing four criminal charges for his role in the efforts to remain in power after losing the election.)\n\nHaley and DeSantis both said they disagreed with Trump's presidential immunity argument -a claim that he is currently trying to use in court to avoid criminal prosecution. Haley called Trump's suggestion that he can't be prosecuted for his conduct in office \"absolutely ridiculous,\" while DeSantis said that he's \"always going to follow the Constitution.\"\n\n\"You can't terminate the Constitution,\" DeSantis added. \"I mean, you know [Trump] does that.\" He added that Trump commits \"word vomit from time to time on social media.\"\n\nHaley, citing her own parents who \"came here legally,\" declared unflinchingly that deportation is her solution to the recent influx of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is now estimated at around 10 million.\n\n\"You have to deport them,\" she said. \"And the reason you have to deport them is they're cutting the line. ... That is actually what will get them to stop coming.\"\n\nDeSantis charged that Haley is not as tough on immigration as she claims. \"She's weak on immigration, she's bankrolled by people who want open borders,\" he said. \"Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration. That's like having a fox guard the hen house.\"\n\nDeSantis responded to the same question by promising to eliminate federal incentives while cracking down on sanctuary cities, though he notably avoided explicitly discussing deportation. DeSantis did emphasize, however, \"the number of people who will be amnestied when I am President is zero.\"\n\nThe candidates engaged in perhaps their sharpest disagreement of the debate over support for the U.S.'s continued funding of Ukraine's defense against Russia.\n\nHaley advocated for Congress to provide aid to Kyiv, emphasizing the potential escalation of the Russian threat and its implication for NATO countries. \"Dictators always do what they say they're going to do,\" she said. \"Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next ... and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war.\"\n\nIn contrast, DeSantis raised concerns about the amount of money allocated to the conflict, demanding accountability and expressing skepticism about the lack of a clear endgame. \"We need to find a way to end this,\" he said, adding that the intense focus on Ukraine has been diverting attention from other pertinent issues, such as the growing challenge posed by China and domestic problems like the rise in undocumented immigration. \"People like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine's border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong.\"\n\n\"You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations,\" DeSantis said, \"but you can't take the United Nations out of the ambassador.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Haley and DeSantis both unequivocally expressed their support for Israel. DeSantis made explicit that he would not \"second-guess\" any actions taken by Israel. Pressed by the moderators about whether he would tell Israel not to expel Palestinians from Gaza, DeSantis maintained his unyielding support and asserted that being a good ally means backing Israel's decisions unconditionally. He also notably referred to Palestinians as \"the Palestinian Arabs,\" a term used in right-wing circles to undermine the idea of Palestinians having a distinct national identity.\n\nDeSantis made a significant pledge on Social Security, promising not to raise the retirement age \"in the face of declining life expectancy.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can raise the retirement age when our life expectancy is collapsing in this country,\" he said. \"That's a huge problem in and of itself.\"\n\nHaley accused DeSantis of voting three times as a former congressman to raise the retirement age to 70 and asserted that Americans in their 20s should anticipate an increase in the retirement age if she becomes President. \"We're going to change it to reflect more of what life expectancy should be,\" she said, though Haley did not specify the exact retirement age she envisioned.\n\nAlthough the debate featured several heated exchanges between DeSantis and Haley, the moderators attempted to end the night on a more lighthearted tone. It almost worked.\n\nAsked what he admired in Haley, DeSantis expressed appreciation for her role as U.N. Ambassador and acknowledged her \"great achievement\" of being the governor of South Carolina, mentioning that his wife attended college there.\n\nBut when asked about DeSantis, Haley offered a concise response. \"I think he's been a good governor,\" she said curtly, eliciting a few awkward chuckles from the audience.\n\nIn closing remarks, Haley expressed confidence that she is the best candidate to beat President Joe Biden, emphasizing that she leads Biden by double digit points in some polls. \"We can't afford another nail-biter election,\" she said. \"Ron doesn't beat Joe Biden.\"\n\nShe added that \"we can't go through four more years of chaos\" and once again took aim at the former President: \"If it's Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos.\"\n\nDeSantis railed at his competitors during his closing remarks, repeating a line he also used in his introduction: \"Donald Trump's running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for her donor's issues-I'm running for your issues.\" DeSantis also reiterated his criticism of Haley's approach as \"pale pastels\" and \"warmed up corporatism,\" doubling down on his campaign's emphasis on what he framed as issues that resonate with voters. \"I'm the only one running that has beaten the Left time and time again, from the teacher's union to [former NIH Director Dr. Anthony] Fauci to the Democratic Party,\" he said.\n\nWith reporting by Mini Racker/Des Moines.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "Haley-DeSantis Fight to Take Center Stage at Third Republican Debate\n\nT hough five candidates will appear onstage , Wednesday's Republican presidential debate is shaping up to be a two-person showdown.\n\nSince late summer, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has been steadily gaining on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, long viewed by many conservatives as the most compelling alternative for those hesitant about former President Donald Trump. Haley appears to be outperforming the governor in New Hampshire, where undeclared voters can participate in the primary and thousands of Democrats recently changed their registration, and she's closing in on him in national polls; one recent Iowa poll even found them tied for second place. DeSantis on Monday rolled out a coveted endorsement from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, and has been attacking Haley for weeks, largely on foreign policy. Now, the third debate will be one of the last opportunities for Haley or DeSantis to cement themselves as the candidate best positioned to beat Trump.\n\nA pre-debate memo from Betsy Ankney, Haley's campaign manager, focuses almost exclusively on DeSantis, calling him a \"sinking ship\" in Iowa and positing that even if he does well there, that's \"as good as it's going to get for him,\" with Haley performing better in New Hampshire and South Carolina. The campaign also notes that, according to DeSantis' own polling, the plurality of his voters would back Haley if he were to drop out.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the frontrunner in this primary,\" Betsy Ankney writes. \"The question has always been who will emerge as the strongest alternative to him, with the talent, resources, and pathway to go the distance. At the beginning of the year, most pundits claimed it was Ron DeSantis. And then America met Ron DeSantis.\"\n\nThe DeSantis team's own pre-debate memo rejects the Haley camp's framing.\n\n\"Simply put, without Ron DeSantis in this primary, Trump is the Republican nominee,\" write three top DeSantis strategists. \"Nikki Haley and others are, at best, simply playing the role of spoiler-exponentially increasing the odds of a Trump nomination. Every dollar the Pro-Haley community collects or spends should also be listed as an 'in-kind' contribution on Trump's campaign FEC reports.\"\n\nBoth camps expect Wednesday's debate to be foreign policy-centered, the culmination of weeks of attacks between the two following the beginning of the war in Israel. The rivalry picked up In mid-October, when Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations, criticized DeSantis for describing all Gazans as antisemitic by emphasizing the need to \"separate civilians from terrorists.\" The DeSantis camp quickly interpreted her statement as Haley expressing support for the U.S. accepting refugees from Gaza, a policy she never backed.\n\nWhile the conflict in the Middle East will feature prominently in the debate - Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel has said the candidates will reaffirm the party's \"unwavering support of Israel\"-Haley and DeSantis may also touch on recent dueling attack ads about the candidates' supposed ties to China. A recent Haley spot on the subject accused DeSantis of \"lying because he's losing.\" Days later, pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down released an ad hitting back . Claims in both videos have been called into question by independent fact-checkers.\n\nDuring the debate, Haley is expected to contrast her more hawkish views on Israel and Ukraine with the more isolationist views of the Florida governor and another competitor, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.  But where Haley's allies view her experience as a strength, the DeSantis camp thinks voters prefer his ideology. \"While Haley is strongest among 'moderate and left-of-center Republicans,' she has a ballot ceiling that will not allow her to appeal to the much larger 'America First' base of the party,\" the DeSantis memo reads.\n\nDeSantis' campaign is arguing that Haley is a distraction from the real fight for the GOP nomination between the Florida Governor and the former President.\n\n\"This is a two-man race,\" DeSantis Press Secretary Bryan Griffin wrote in a statement. \"Team Trump knows it-that's why they're spending over $1 million this week alone to attack DeSantis in Iowa despite proclaiming the primary was 'over' in August. And the other candidates know it, too. With all the attacks and attention focused on DeSantis, we know we are over the target and primed to win this nomination.\"\n\nGriffin is right that Trumpworld is piling on. Numerous recent press releases from the former President's campaign gleefully slam the Florida governor by highlighting his dynamic with Haley, including her rise to second place in some polls, the ad wars, and her recent comments on the speculation that DeSantis wears lifts to appear taller.\n\n\"Life must be miserable for Ron DeSanctimonious when even Nikki 'Birdbrain' Haley is dunking on him for wearing high heels,\" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung wrote.\n\nWrite to Mini Racker at mini.racker@time.com"

      "text": "Ron DeSantis drops out of presidential race and backs Trump\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nHe quit ahead of the Republican primary election in New Hampshire, where he was polling in the single digits.\n\nMr DeSantis was once considered a strong contender for the party's nomination - but on Sunday he said he did not \"have a clear path to victory\".\n\nNikki Haley, Mr Trump's last remaining challenger, said she was the \"only one\" able to beat US President Joe Biden.\n\nMs Haley will go head-to-head with Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the second in a series of state-by-state contests to pick a Republican nominee for the November general election.\n\nIn a nearly five-minute long video on X, formerly Twitter, released on Sunday afternoon, Mr DeSantis said his campaign had \"left it all out on the field\".\n\n\"If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome - more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it,\" he added, as he ended his seven-month campaign.\n\nThe Florida governor said he was endorsing Mr Trump, who is the clear frontrunner after winning the first contest in Iowa with 51% of the vote. Mr DeSantis said it had become clear that a majority of Republican voters \"want to give Donald Trump another chance\".\n\nHe acknowledged \"disagreements\" with the former president, but said Mr Trump was \"superior\" to Mr Biden, who is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee in November's general election.\n\n\"I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,\" Mr DeSantis said.\n\nThere were loud cheers when Mr Trump made his first comments about Mr DeSantis's withdrawal and endorsement to a room in New Hampshire full of supporters on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLater, addressing an audience at a rally, Mr Trump described his former opponent as a \"really terrific person\", adding: \"He ran a really good campaign, it's not easy.\"\n\nMr DeSantis had presented himself as the Republican candidate who could deliver Mr Trump's populist agenda without the drama or baggage.\n\nBut one of the speakers at the event, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, referred to him as \"diet Trump\". And several supporters of Mr Trump told the BBC they liked the Florida governor but felt this was not the right time for him.\n\nLynne Mason, 60, said she thought Mr DeSantis's campaign was \"a little weak\" and she had \"expected more from him\". Mr Trump, she added, was the \"only person at this time who can save this country\".\n\nBethAnne Tatro, another local backing Mr Trump, agreed. \"I think that President Trump has proven, from being in office previously, that he can do this again and get things back on track.\"\n\nAfter Mr DeSantis' announcement, the Trump campaign called on all Republicans to rally behind Mr Trump, slamming his former UN Ambassador as \"the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement\".\n\nMr DeSantis also took a swipe at Ms Haley, calling her a member of \"the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism\".\n\nMs Haley, a former South Carolina governor, responded by insisting she was the conservative candidate - the \"only one\" - who could beat Mr Biden.\n\n\"There's two people in this race,\" she told CNN in New Hampshire. \"That's what we wanted all along, and we're going to keep going.\"\n\nMr DeSantis narrowly finished ahead of Ms Haley in last week's Iowa caucuses with 21% of the vote, compared to her 19%, both well behind Mr Trump.\n\nAt the time, Mr DeSantis framed the second-place finish as a victory, but it was a major disappointment after he had spent the bulk of his time and resources courting its conservative evangelical voters.\n\nHis departure from the race allows Mr DeSantis to avoid an embarrassing potential third-place finish in New Hampshire to Ms Haley, who has focused far more of her resources in the state.\n\nBut a person familiar with Mr DeSantis' election night plans in New Hampshire was completely caught off guard by the news of his exit.\n\nThe source told the BBC the campaign had just confirmed plans with them on Saturday for their election night celebration this coming Tuesday.\n\nChris Ager, the state committee chair of New Hampshire's Republican Party, told the BBC that \"the race has been moving toward a one-vs-one between Trump and Haley for a while\".\n\n\"This makes it so,\" he added.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis: Who is the Florida governor and White House contender?\n\nRon DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida who has built a national profile with his combative brand of cultural conservatism, has entered the fray for the 2024 White House race.\n\nThe Ivy League-educated former naval officer has been hailed by many on the right as a political rock star, and dismissed by the left as a right-wing extremist.\n\nBut to get to the White House, he'll first need to get past his onetime political mentor, Donald Trump, and a crowded field of other Republican hopefuls.\n\nAt 44 years old, Mr DeSantis is still a relative newcomer to US politics, having first been elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. Just six years later in 2018 - after a short-lived bid to become a senator - he was elected governor.\n\nBorn in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1978, Mr DeSantis went on to study history at Yale University - where he was captain of the baseball team - and soon after to Harvard Law School.\n\nDuring his second year at Harvard, he was commissioned as an officer in the US Navy and was assigned to its legal arm, the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps. His service as a JAG officer included working with detainees at Guantanamo Bay, as well as an assignment as a legal adviser for the elite US Navy Seals deployed to Iraq.\n\nMr DeSantis was honourably discharged from the military in 2010, although he continues to serve in the US Navy reserve. It was also around this time that he met his wife, Casey, a local TV news reporter who helped spearhead fundraising in the wake of 2022's Hurricane Ian.\n\nAfter his active duty service ended, Mr DeSantis became a federal prosecutor. Then in 2012 he entered a race for a seat in Florida's Sixth Congressional District, one of the most conservative in the state.\n\nDuring this initial foray into Florida politics, Mr DeSantis largely campaigned on a platform of \"small government\" and reduced taxes - as well as a pronounced opposition to the Obama administration.\n\nHe condemned what he deemed the government's tendency to intervene on \"virtually any issue, from the waistline of children to the temperature of earth\".\n\n\"My mission was largely to stop Barack Obama,\" he recalled in a speech last year at a conservative conference in Texas. \"Those were good fights. Important fights.\"\n\nIn 2018, after five years on Capitol Hill - where he helped found the \"Freedom Caucus\" of hard-right conservatives - Mr DeSantis announced his intention to run for governor, with the full endorsement of then-President Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trump's influence over the DeSantis campaign was quickly and abundantly clear.\n\nIn one memorable campaign ad, Mr DeSantis was seen telling one of his children to \"build the wall\" while playing with blocks, teaching another to read with a \"Make America Great Again\" sign, and reading to his son Mason: \"Then Mr Trump said 'you're fired!' - I love that part,\" he says.\n\nMr DeSantis was sworn in as governor in January 2019.\n\nEarly on in his tenure as governor, Mr DeSantis gained national recognition for his handling of Covid-19 in Florida. While he ordered a state-wide lockdown early in the pandemic, he soon began lifting the state's restrictions. By July of 2020 - as cases skyrocketed nationally - he ordered that schools be reopened.\n\nSince then, he has also expanded gun rights and the death penalty, harshly clamped down on illegal immigration and signed a bill banning most abortions after six weeks, vowing to \"defend the dignity of human life and transform Florida into a pro-family state\".\n\nHe's also been in a long-running row - and legal battle - with Disney, which criticised the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill. Florida subsequently voted to restructure the special district that had been created more than 50 years ago to oversee development of the land around Disney World, which includes four theme parks, dozens of hotels and entertainment venues.\n\nThe moves gave Mr DeSantis the power to appoint members to the district's governing board, removing that authority from landowners in the 25,000-acre district, of which Disney is the largest.\n\nAll these policies have elevated his status among voters as a potential Republican candidate for president.\n\nMr DeSantis' rising national profile has increasingly come under fire from his former political mentor Mr Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for the governor's 2018 election win.\n\nMr Trump has also increasingly turned to insults and nicknames, while at the same time attacking Mr DeSantis on some of his policies, often accusing him of aiming to \"destroy\" Social Security and the government-run Medicare health system for older Americans.\n\nRecent polls have shown that Mr DeSantis still lags behind the former president as far as his popularity among US Republicans. Various surveys conducted in mid-May 2023 show him between 28 and 45 percentage points behind.\n\nSo far, Mr DeSantis has shrugged off the challenges and attempted to position himself as the Republican with the best chance of successfully returning the party to the White House.\n\n\"'If I run, I'll be running against Biden,\" he told Piers Morgan in March.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis bans 'global elite' lab-grown meat\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned lab-grown meat, saying he will \"save our beef\" from the \"global elite\" and its \"authoritarian plans\".\n\n\"Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs,\" Mr DeSantis said in a statement.\n\nThe first-in-the-nation law prohibits anyone from selling or distributing lab-grown meat in Florida.\n\nSimilar efforts are under way in Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee.\n\nLab-grown or \"cultivated\" meat was first cleared for consumption in the US in 2022.\n\nThe process of making cultivated meat involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats. The end product is genetically indistinguishable from traditionally produced meat .\n\nStudies have suggested that eating cultivated meat can cut carbon emissions and water usage, and free up land for nature, compared to eating traditionally produced meat.\n\nThe World Economic Forum, an international non-governmental organisation in Switzerland, has for years touted lab-grown meat as an efficient and environmentally-friendly way to produce food, and feed a rapidly growing global population. It has also promoted insect farming as a \" credible and alternative protein source \".\n\nLobbyists for edible insects have launched a campaign asking the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add mealworms, crickets protein powder and other insect products to the agency's database of safe ingredients.\n\nThese unconventional food sources have become fodder for the US culture wars. Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines two years ago after she insinuated the government was monitoring whether Americans were eating fake meat grown in a petri dish.\n\nAt an event on Wednesday announcing the new law, Mr DeSantis said he was \"fighting against an ideology that ultimately wants to eliminate meat production in the US and around the globe\".\n\n\"In the state of Florida we've put down the marker very clearly; we stand with agriculture. We stand with the cattle ranchers,\" he said.\n\nFlorida's commissioner of agriculture Wilton Simpson applauded the legislation as a \"tremendous step in the right direction\".\n\n\"Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first-in-the-nation legislation banning lab-grown meat,\" Mr Simpson said.\n\nBut the move was also supported by an unlikely supporter of Mr DeSantis, Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. It \"pains me deeply\" to agree with Mr DeSantis, Mr Fetterman wrote on X, \"but I co-sign this\".\n\nGood Meat, a cultivated meat company which says it is the first in the world to sell lab-grown meat, wrote on X it was \"disappointed\" by the new Florida law.\n\n\"In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase,\" it said.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "US election 2024: Where did it all go wrong for Ron DeSantis?\n\nRon DeSantis cut an image of confidence in the video that launched his campaign for president last May.\n\nHe walked across a flag-adorned stage to cheers and promised his supporters \"the Great American Comeback\".\n\nSeven months later, the man some called \"Trump 2.0\" and \"Trump without the baggage\" has abandoned his White House bid. His departure came with the admission that there is no \"clear path to victory\" against the dominant frontrunner for the Republican nomination.\n\nSo where did things go wrong for the Florida governor, considered a political rock star not long ago for his war on \"woke ideology\" and strong track record in office?\n\nThere were problems with the candidate himself - a perceived lack of charisma and his awkwardness with voters - as well as with the campaign he ran. But the real reason for his downfall was simply the man he was up against, Donald Trump.\n\nHe could not compete against a figure who enjoyed such unwavering support from his followers, said Matthew Bartlett, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist.\n\n\"He [Trump] has been their political identity, and maybe even personal identity, for the better part of a decade,\" Mr Bartlett said.\n\nLooking back at the campaign, experts said it was an almost impossible election cycle for a relative newcomer to the national stage. Mr DeSantis was essentially running against an incumbent, with name recognition, limitless money and a committed base of voters.\n\nA year ago, when the marathon race for the White House was already underway, it did not feel quite like that.\n\nMr DeSantis started 2023 as a very real threat to Donald Trump. Back then, when only the former president had announced he was running, Mr DeSantis was at around 35% in the polls, within striking distance of his rival.\n\nHe also had momentum after a record re-election victory as Florida governor the previous November. Mr Trump, in contrast, was being blamed by many for the Republicans' disappointing midterm results.\n\nYet that turned out to be the high water mark for the DeSantis campaign.\n\nBy May, when the governor formally announced his run for the White House in an interview with Elon Musk plagued by tech issues, his poll numbers had slumped closer to 20%. Mr Trump had soared back above 50%.\n\nStrategists say the decision to delay the official launch wasted precious months. More importantly, it gave Mr Trump a chance to rebuild his image as a political outsider with the help of the national headlines that surrounded his numerous legal issues.\n\n\"[The DeSantis campaign] started pretty late, [and] raised a ton of money obviously,\" David Kochel, a long-time Iowa Republican strategist, told the BBC. \"But by then Trump was going at him hammer and tong. I don't know that they had effective responses. I think it took them a while to engage.\"\n\nWhile Mr DeSantis may have privately hoped for the former president's legal troubles to catch up with him, he never criticised Mr Trump for them and instead often echoed his rival's claims that he was being unfairly targeted.\n\n\"It seems like every time [Mr Trump] was indicted, his poll numbers went up,\" said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa. \"And to some extent, that's not surprising, because it's kind of a 'rally around the chief effect'.\"\n\nAt first, DeSantis used a strategy of trying not to offend Mr Trump but the former president showed no such restraint, often resorting to nicknames including \"Meatball Ron\" and \"Ron DeSanctimonious\".\n\nMr Trump has demolished every Republican rival he's come up against since entering the political fray in 2015 but not many have chosen, as Mr DeSantis did, to run to Mr Trump's right.\n\nHe focused mainly on culture wars and not the economic issues that topped voters' concerns, and left the moderate lane in the race to Ms Haley.\n\nThrust into the national spotlight, Mr DeSantis's limitations as a candidate were exposed - especially when contrasted with Mr Trump's outsized persona.\n\n\"When you watch DeSantis mosey around a room, it looks like he feels it's something he has to do to take centre stage,\" Mary Civiello, an executive communications coach and body language expert, told the BBC at the time of his launch. \"It also looks like it's not an everyday thing. You could also perceive he's a little nervous about it, as one might expect.\"\n\nThat awkwardness was a particular problem in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote, where retail politics is so important.\n\n\"He has a robotic personality that does not resonate with voters,\" Sean Westwood, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, said of Mr DeSantis. \"In a world where almost all of his attention was focused on Iowa, he still barely managed to win over [Nikki] Haley.\"\n\nBy edging out Ms Haley for second place in Iowa on 15 January, the DeSantis campaign seemed to have bought itself some more time.\n\nSupporters at the caucus night watch party in West Des Moines seemed genuinely pleased with the result - chanting \"Ron!\" and waving banners. In multiple interviews, they expressed confidence that he was in a strong position going forward.\n\n\"He's the clear alternative to President Trump,\" said college student Jeff Schremer. \"Voters can coalesce around him going into New Hampshire and South Carolina.\"\n\nIn the end, Ron DeSantis voters in neither state will get a chance to back him. By suspending his campaign and endorsing Mr Trump before those primaries, the Florida governor is getting out before he risks damaging his standing with Trump's followers.\n\nAt 45 years old, however, he knows this is not the end of the road.\n\nOne of his supporters, Jack Figge, was also looking to the future when he spoke to the BBC after that underwhelming result back in Iowa. \"This is a big year to see who our leader will be, but I'm much more interested in 2028.\" he said. \"DeSantis is my guy.\"\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Where Ron DeSantis stands on key issues\n\nRon DeSantis has entered the Republican presidential race and, while he trails Donald Trump in the polls, he is widely seen as his main rival. So what does he stand for?\n\nBased on what he has done in Florida and what he has said since he launched his campaign, here's a dash through various policies - and where he differs from Mr Trump.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court voted last year to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion, Mr DeSantis promptly signed a bill prohibiting them after 15 weeks.\n\nLast month he signed a stricter bill passed by his party which banned the procedure after six weeks - before most women know they are pregnant.\n\nPolls show a majority of Floridians, including a significant number of Republicans, oppose the latest measure.\n\nThat may be a warning sign to Mr DeSantis - the party's stance on abortion was widely blamed for its poor performance in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMr Trump has said he supports the states deciding on this issue and privately is thought to believe the six-week ban makes his rival vulnerable electorally.\n\nMr DeSantis has repeatedly waded into culture war issues, particularly what he refers to as \"woke ideology\".\n\nDeclaring often that \"Florida is where woke goes to die\", he has led efforts this year to remake education curriculums by restricting classroom discussions on sex and gender identity. The bill is called \"Don't Say Gay\" by its critics.\n\nHis escalating war with Disney, one of the state's largest employers, began over its criticism of the bill following protests by employees.\n\n\"His opponents are using that as an example of 'the wrong kind of Republicanism',\" said Peter Schorsch, publisher of the Florida Politics news site, who believes the governor's legislative and rhetorical assault on the company may \"be his undoing\" in the 2024 race.\n\nMr Trump has been sharply critical of the Disney feud, warning that the firm could pull its vast investment from the state.\n\nRace has also been in the crosshairs. Teachers in Florida have told the BBC that various laws limiting what can be taught in the classroom have had a chilling effect on how they teach history.\n\nMr DeSantis has taken one of Mr Trump's signature policies and run with it.\n\nHe first came to national prominence in a 2018 campaign advert which featured him teaching his baby how to build a border wall out of children's bricks.\n\nAnd this week he told Fox News that a day one priority in the White House would be to mobilise resources to construct it for real.\n\nImmigration is a subject on which he likes to make headlines.\n\nHe has sent asylum seekers to the Democrat-controlled state of Massachusetts in a move condemned by critics as a gimmick.\n\nDespite the pressure on budgets as debt ceiling talks drag on, neither man is keen to pick a fight with a crucial voting bloc - pensioners.\n\n\"We're not going to mess with Social Security as Republicans,\" said Mr DeSantis. \"I think that that's pretty clear.\"\n\nBut it has become a bone of contention between the two.\n\nMr DeSantis has in the past supported raising the retirement age to 70 so Mr Trump, who has vowed to protect Social Security, has attacked him for it.\n\nThis is not a strong issue for the Florida governor.\n\nAfter calling the war a \"territorial dispute\" that was not part of the US's vital interests, he was rounded on by several senior members of his party.\n\nHis 2024 rival Nikki Haley warned him not to go \"weak at the knees\" on foreign policy.\n\nHe has since tried to clarify his remarks and said he would like to see a settlement but like Mr Trump he has not given details how.\n\nThere is a lot of focus on whether both candidates might halt the military aid that has been flowing to Kyiv since the start of the war.\n\nBoth have called on other countries in Europe to contribute more.\n\nAs the US economy loses steam, voters may be looking for a responsible economic steward to be their next president - more proactive than Mr Biden but less reactive than Mr Trump.\n\nAccording to Edwin Benton, a political scientist at the University of South Florida, the governor's intense focus on the culture wars will leave many with the perception that he is less interested in attending to issues like the rising cost of living and property insurance.\n\n\"When you get right down to it, people are going to look for the real nitty-gritty: is this person interested in me and my family?\" he said.\n\nMr DeSantis visited UK, South Korea, Japan and Israel on an \"international trade mission\" aimed to build on the economic relationships between Florida and the four countries.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Jacksonville shooting: DeSantis booed at vigil for victims of racist attack\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has been loudly booed at a vigil for victims of a racially motivated shooting.\n\nThe Republican candidate for president was heckled in Jacksonville, where hundreds gathered on Sunday to remember the three victims of the attack.\n\nHe was forced to step back from the microphone before a member of the city council asked the crowd to listen.\n\n\"It ain't about parties today,\" Ju'Coby Pittman said, adding: \"A bullet don't know a party.\"\n\nMr DeSantis, 44, who has loosened gun laws in the state and faced criticism from civil rights leaders for targeting what he calls \"woke ideology\", eventually spoke and called the gunman a \"scumbag\" which prompted applause from some of the crowd.\n\nAround 200 people attended the vigil, which took place in a predominantly black area just yards away from the Dollar General shop where the shooting happened the previous day.\n\nTwenty-one year old Ryan Christopher Palmeter fired eleven rounds at 52 year-old Angela Carr who was sitting in her vehicle, before entering the shop and shooting another two people dead.\n\nAnolt Laguerre Jr, 19, worked at the Dollar General and was killed as he tried to flee.\n\nJerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29, was shot dead as he entered the premises. Another woman was chased but managed to escape.\n\nAs police arrived, the attacker turned a gun on himself and died at the scene. An AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and a Glock handgun, both legally obtained, were used in the shooting.\n\nPolice have said the gunman was motivated by racist hatred.\n\n\"He knew what he was doing. He was 100% lucid,\" Sheriff T K Waters told reporters. \"Finely put: this shooting was racially motivated and he hated black people.\"\n\nHe left behind racist messages, police said, which read like \"the diary of a madman\".\n\nThe gunman was detained for 72 hours in 2017 under mental health legislation that allows the involuntary detainment of an individual for treatment. He was released after the examination, police said, which is why it did not appear on his background checks when purchasing the guns.\n\nMr DeSantis said financial support would be provided to bolster security at the historically black Edward Waters University, near to where the shooting happened.\n\nThe gunman first went to the university campus, where he was asked to identify himself by a security officer. When he refused, he was asked to leave. He was then seen putting on a bullet-resistant vest and a mask before leaving the area.\n\n\"What he did is totally unacceptable in the state of Florida,\" Mr DeSantis said. \"We are not going to let people be targeted based on their race.\"\n\nBishop John Guns, referring to Mr Gallion, told the crowd: \"In two weeks I have to preach a funeral of a man who should still be alive. I wept in church today like a baby because my heart is tired. We are exhausted.\"\n\nThe shooting fell on the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for civil rights, where Dr Martin Luther King Jr gave his famous 'I have a dream' speech.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, during remarks on the anniversary on Monday, called the shooting an \"act of domestic violence extremism\".\n\n\"Domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy is the greatest terrorist threat we face in the homeland,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nThe president also renewed calls for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nPolice have issued a photo of a man they want to speak to over reports a Charlton fan was abused.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Critics called the measures \"mean spirited\".\n\nThe Republican governor is expected to enter the 2024 White House race soon.\n\nHundreds of similar regulations on LGBT issues have been proposed in conservative-run states across the US.\n\nBut Mr DeSantis' prospects as a presidential contender have turned all eyes on the Sunshine State.\n\nHe is widely expected to declare his candidacy as soon as next week.\n\n\"We need to let our kids just be kids,\" Mr DeSantis said as he signed the five bills on Wednesday at the evangelical Cambridge Christian School in Tampa.\n\n\"What we've said in Florida is we are going to remain a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy.\"\n\nThe legislation bans transgender-identifying children from accessing such treatments as puberty blockers or hormone therapy.\n\nWhile the laws are dubbed the Let Kids Be Kids package, one measure also places new restrictions on adults seeking transgender medical treatment.\n\nSuch patients must now obtain written consent on a form adopted by two oversight boards whose members are appointed by the governor.\n\nAnother of the laws bans school employees from telling students their preferred pronouns, or asking students about their preferred pronouns.\n\nMr DeSantis said: \"We never did this through all of human history until like two weeks ago. They're having third graders declare pronouns? We're not doing the pronoun Olympics in Florida.\"\n\nThe governor also signed into law a bill requiring all bathrooms or locker rooms at public facilities - from schools to prisons - to be used exclusively for men and women \"based on their biological sex\".\n\nAnother of the laws, titled Protecting Children's Innocence, grants the state the power to strip businesses of their licences if they allow children into \"adult live performances\", such as drag shows.\n\nTransgender medical treatments are endorsed by a number of major medical associations in the US, considered to be appropriate and even life-saving care for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) said the Florida bills would have \"a chilling effect on the medical community by inserting politics into healthcare\".\n\nBut many conservatives and some detransitioners - those who stop or seek to reverse a gender transition - have spoken out against the prevailing medical consensus, labelling such procedures as child abuse or chemical castration.\n\nDemocrats lashed out at the legislation in Florida.\n\n\"Every other parent has the right to raise their child the way that they want to as long as your child is not gay, trans, bisexual,\" Democratic state Senator Shevrin Jones, who is gay, told the Associated Press news agency.\n\n\"That's freedom for some parents but not for all parents.\"\n\nAnother Democratic state Senator, Victor Torres, said the bills were \"mean spirited, unnecessary\".\n\nAs governor, Mr DeSantis has waded into America's culture wars, signing bills banning teaching on gender identity in public schools, restricting abortion access, protecting gun rights and railing against \"woke indoctrination\" in the classroom.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is currently leading in the race for next year's Republican presidential nomination, with Mr DeSantis in second spot more than 36 points behind, according to the Real Clear Politics opinion polling average.\n\nThe winner will challenge President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the election of November 2024.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nCarla Denyer says the equalities watchdog's guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination.\n\nRoz Foyer, head of the STUC, said she did not agree with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission guidance.\n\nCampaigners were marching in response to a Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Is she his secret weapon?\n\nIt is not unusual for politicians running for office to get their spouses involved, but during Ron DeSantis' tenure as Florida governor, his wife has often been in the spotlight.\n\nMrs DeSantis, 42, has spearheaded the governor's response on issues ranging from disaster relief to mental health.\n\nThe mother of three is no stranger to the national stage. She had been a television news reporter and commentator in Florida for years by the time she met her future husband while playing golf in 2006.\n\nThey were married three years later at Walt Disney World, now locked in a legal battle with the governor .\n\nAs Mr DeSantis has climbed up the rungs, launching bids for the US House of Representatives, the US Senate and then the governor's mansion, his wife has been there every step of the way.\n\nShe has appeared in his TV ads, accompanied him on foreign trips, introduced him at speaking engagements and is said to be \"looped in on every email and calendar invite\" that goes to the governor.\n\nIn March 2022, five months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she revealed that she was cancer-free.\n\nThe ensuing weeks saw the first lady feature prominently on the campaign trail, including in a tearful video tribute to her husband who she said \"was there to fight for me when I didn't have the strength to fight for myself\".\n\nAnd after Hurricane Ian ravaged the state weeks before Florida voters passed judgment on Mr DeSantis' re-election bid, she led efforts to raise money for hurricane relief.\n\nThe state's disaster fund ultimately raised more than $60m (£48m) to support recovery efforts, including more than $2m in the first 24 hours.\n\n\"We just couldn't be more proud of what you have done,\" Mrs DeSantis said. \"Thank you to the people across the state and the country for stepping up big.\"\n\nMr DeSantis was easily re-elected in November, winning by the largest margin of any governor in the state in four decades.\n\nAt his inauguration event in January, and then again at his state of the state address in March, Mrs DeSantis stood out with the long white satin gloves she wore.\n\nPolitical observers openly pondered if she was channelling former US first lady Jackie Kennedy. And, if so, did she too want to be the lady of the White House? It seems we have the answer.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis picks Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to fill Marco Rubio's Senate seat\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed state Attorney General Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate, setting her up to fill the seat of Sen. Marco Rubio, whom President-elect Donald Trump tapped to be secretary of state.\n\nRubio was selected to serve in Trump's administration shortly after Trump won the 2024 presidential race, handing DeSantis a Senate appointment that is likely to have ripple effects across Florida government and politics.\n\nIt has widely been expected in recent weeks that Moody would be the pick, while others, including Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, did talk to DeSantis about the position. DeSantis had said publicly he had reservations about appointing a member of the House because of the GOP's slim majority in that chamber.\n\nState Sen. Jay Collins, who served as a Green Beret, also got considerable support from conservatives who wanted DeSantis to pick an military veteran.\n\nBut ultimately, the seat will go to Moody, 49, who easily won her first election in 2018 to become attorney general and her re-election bid in 2022. She was unable to run again due to term limits.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nShe will have to run in a 2026 special election to keep the seat for the final two years of Rubio's term. Mills has already said he is running for Senate in 2026, as first reported by Politico, and Cammack is mulling a run, meaning Moody is likely going to face Republican primary challengers.\n\nAsked about the possibility of running in 2026 at the Capitol, Mills told NBC News, \"We're keeping our eye on the seat. We'll see how she votes and how she supports the president. I respect the governor's decision always. I think he's a great governor. He's the best Governor we have in America. But that's not to say that 2026 doesn't shape up to potentially see a primary.\"\n\nRight now, though, Moody's appointment will set a new record for Republican women in the Senate, according to data from the Center for American Women in Politics. When Moody takes the seat, there will be 10 GOP women in the chamber.\n\nMoody is a close ally of DeSantis, who has served as his chief legal bulldog on a host of high-profile political fights with the Biden administration.\n\nMost recently, Moody's office, which is technically separate from the governor's office, filed a lawsuit in October against the Department of Justice over what she argued was a federal government effort to block Florida's own investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump, which happened in September at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.\n\n\"Every day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the State's case becomes harder to prove at trial,\" Moody argued in the suit. \"By contrast, the federal government suffers no injury from Florida investigating state law crimes, as the State has no intention of interfering with or obstructing the federal investigation.\"\n\nDeSantis has said he believes the federal government had \"stonewalled\" Florida's ability to conduct its own investigation.\n\nMoody said the state's independent investigation was needed, in part, because the DOJ should not have been investigating an attempted assassination attempt on Trump while simultaneously trying to prosecute him. Since Trump's election victory in November, former special counsel Jack Smith , who was leading federal cases against Trump over whether he tried to overturn the 2020 election and over alleged mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, and those cases against Trump have ended.\n\nIn December, Moody also released an arrest affidavit for Ryan Routh, the alleged gunmen behind the second assassination attempt. She said a traffic backup that resulted from searching for Routh led to an accident that injured a 6-year-old girl. Routh is in federal custody and facing five charges related to the attempted assassination.\n\nEarlier this year, the state attorney general also sued the Biden administration to try and block a rule Moody argued would have forced doctors to provide gender transition care against their judgement. Transgender issues have been one of the main culture war fights DeSantis has focused on as governor.\n\nDeSantis had not signaled publicly who he would pick to fill Rubio's seat, but has said the person will be a hard-liner on immigration, including pushing reforms to the so-called H-1B visa program, which has been the subject of intense internal post-election fights among Trump's own supporters.\n\nTrump-backers like billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk have said the program offers lower-cost international talent for many companies, while the populist wing of the MAGA movement, led by people like conservative pundits Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer, have said the program should be abolished.\n\nTrump said in late December that he believes the program is \" great .\"\n\nMoody's pick is also likely to reshuffle DeSantis' own political orbit.\n\nIt is widely believed that longtime DeSantis chief of staff, James Uthmeier, will now be appointed to fill Moody's post, requiring that DeSantis select a new top staffer. Uthmeier served as the campaign manager for DeSantis' failed 2024 presidential bid and is considered one of his closest confidants.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is refusing to take Harris' call on Hurricane Helene\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is not taking calls from Vice President Kamala Harris about storm recovery just over a week after Hurricane Helene hammered parts of his state.\n\nA source familiar with the situation said he was dodging the Democratic presidential nominee's calls because they \"seemed political,\" according to a DeSantis aide.\n\n\"Kamala was trying to reach out, and we didn't answer,\" the DeSantis aide told NBC News.\n\nThe same person said \"not to my knowledge\" when asked if DeSantis had spoken to President Joe Biden.\n\nLast week, DeSantis said Biden had called him, but he was flying at the time so could not take the call. Biden was in north Florida last week to survey storm damage, but DeSantis was holding a news press conference that had already been scheduled in another part of the state so they did not meet. A source familiar with the planning said that the Biden team had invited DeSantis to the event in north Florida.\n\nDeSantis has been in direct contact with Federal Emergency Management Director Deanne Criswell.\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall on Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 27, devastating some of the state's rural north Florida counties and swamping cities along the Gulf Coast with storm surge. Many of those cities, including the heavily populated Tampa region, are still dealing with significant flood damage and debris removal.\n\nAfter landfall, remnants of Helene continued to cut a path through the Southeast, leaving more than 200 dead and swamping the region, including historic flooding in western North Carolina.\n\nIn Helene's immediate aftermath, DeSantis said that \" we have it handled \" in reference to storm cleanup and that the federal government should focus on North Carolina.\n\nOther governors have offered more praise for the federal response, with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp saying he had spoken to Biden and thanked him for the assistance , and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, also a Republican, saying it had been \" superb .\"\n\nIn what he dubbed Operation Blue Ridge , DeSantis also sent Florida resources to North Carolina, including members of the Florida National Guard and officials from several state agencies.\n\nOver the weekend, DeSantis said those assets are now returning to Florida as the state expects a midweek landfall of Hurricane Milton, a major storm that is expected to affect huge swaths of the state, including coastal cities flooded by Hurricane Helene.\n\nThat storm is expected to make landfall in the central portion of Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday.\n\nTwo other officials with DeSantis' office said that so far, there has been no effort by Biden to reach out to the governor on Hurricane Milton.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has talked about Hurricane Helene at length, and at times in overt political terms - including pushing false information . At one point he claimed on social media that a photo Harris had posted on social media getting a storm briefing was \" FAKE and STAGED .\"\n\nTrump visited Georgia in the days after the storm and appeared at an event with Kemp. He also launched a GoFundMe to help organizations doing relief work in the region.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nTrump suggests immigrants have 'bad genes' in latest disparagement of migrants\n\nHurricane Milton's rapid intensification is part of a climate-fueled trend\n\nGeorgia Supreme Court reinstates state's 6-week abortion ban\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis privately tells donors he plans to fundraise for Trump\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told donors and supporters at a private retreat last weekend that he plans to help raise money for Donald Trump 's presidential campaign, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nDeSantis told his allies about the move to help Trump during a private gathering on Saturday at South Florida's Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, these people explained.\n\n\"He did say it in front of a group of people at the Hard Rock,\" a DeSantis adviser told NBC News.\n\nThe person emphasized that DeSantis pledged to support Republicans up and down the ballot - \"including presidential\" - when he dropped his bid for president.\n\nDeSantis' shift comes after he was effectively in a political war with Trump, both before and since the Florida governor dropped out of the primary race in January. It remains unclear if Trump and his team want DeSantis to help them, or have him as an ally, despite the Florida governor's endorsement of Trump in January .\n\nMany of the bundlers who heard from DeSantis at the Hard Rock about the decision will likely follow his lead and start trying to raise money for the former president, according to a fundraiser who was at the event.\n\n\"I would say the majority in the room would now be willing to help Trump,\" a DeSantis bundler who was at the recent meeting said.\n\nTexas businessman Roy Bailey, who was a co-chair of DeSantis' national finance advisory board, said in an interview on Wednesday that he's planning to go back to help raise money for Trump, as he did in 2020.\n\n\"I will follow the governor's lead and I will do anything that he or President Trump ask me to do to help him win this election,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"I know where there are DeSantis supporters all over Texas and all over the country that will want to help President Trump. So that's what I'll try to make happen,\" he added.\n\nA Trump campaign adviser said they were not aware that DeSantis was going to start raising money from them but added that \"everyone should be working towards defeating Joe Biden and electing President Trump.\"\n\nDeSantis' donor retreat happened on the same day as Trump's biggest fundraiser of the cycle; the campaign said it raised $50.5 million .\n\nThe two men were longtime political allies after Trump's endorsement helped DeSantis become governor in 2018. As it became clear DeSantis was considering running against Trump in 2024, the relationship publicly soured, and towards the end of DeSantis' campaign, both sides regularly trashed the other .\n\nShortly after DeSantis dropped out of the race , Susie Wiles, his former political adviser turned Trump's campaign chief, posted a quip at the governor on social media: \"Bye, bye.\" DeSantis famously fired Wiles after she helped run his first gubernatorial campaign, adding a layer of personal rivalry to the feud.\n\nIn February, DeSantis shared his concerns with supporters about Trump, noting he believed the former president should not play \" identity politics \" when picking a 2024 running mate. Trump's campaign subsequently ripped DeSantis.\n\nStill, for Trump, getting DeSantis' help could be a benefit as the former president has been behind President Joe Biden in fundraising.\n\nDeSantis' finance committee is full of fundraisers with massive networks that could help raise money for Trump.\n\nEmil Henry, the CEO of Tiger Infrastructure Partners, was a member of DeSantis' national finance board. Others on the finance committee included Republican donors John Childs, Jay Zeidman and Bob Giuffra.\n\nThe Trump campaign's announcement that it raised $50.5 million at investor John Paulson's home on Saturday was a single event record. That money would go to Trump's campaign, the Republican National Committee, a political action committee paying Trump's legal bills and over a dozen state party committees.\n\nBiden announced his campaign and a collection of Democratic committees raised more than $90 million in March alone.\n\nTrump and Republicans have acknowledged they are likely going to be at a money disadvantage throughout the 2024 cycle.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nDemocratic group invests in state-level races this year with an eye on future redistricting cycles\n\nThe U.S. and Japan will announce a historic upgrade in security ties to counter China\n\nEx-Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg sentenced to 5 months for perjury in Trump civil fraud trial\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is in hot water for a plan involving Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus to put golf courses in a state park\n\nSign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. - A proposal to put golf courses in a Florida state park - which has landed Gov. Ron DeSantis in hot water politically - involved two of the biggest names in professional golf history: Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus.\n\nThe proposal to build courses at Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Southeast Florida is now put on hold after bipartisan pushback and protests across the state. But had the idea received state approval, and both Woods and Nicklaus would have been involved in course-design work.\n\n\"There were actually going to be at least two courses; one would be a Tiger course and one would be a Jack course,\" Eugene Stearns, an attorney who represents Nicklaus, told NBC News.\n\nHe said Nicklaus, who has designed more than 300 courses across the world, would have done the work free of charge had the proposal become a reality.\n\n\"For Jack, it was a charitable issue,\" Stearns said.\n\nThe proposal - which was first reported by the Tampa Bay Times - was part of changes to nine state parks that also included the addition of amenities like pickle ball courts and new lodges. Golf courses, however, were the biggest point of controversy from the proposal.\n\nA DeSantis administration official said the plans were not finalized and they expected pushback. But things spiraled too quickly before they were ready when they were made public.\n\n\"We kind of lost the narrative on this one,\" said a DeSantis administration official. \"Leaks did not help.\"\n\nDeSantis never said he backed the plan, and he has stated he never \"approved\" it. It came out of an agency whose head the governor appoints.\n\nThe backlash ran the political spectrum, from Democrats to environmental groups to most state Republicans, including Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, along with Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\n\"I know you love our Florida environment. We campaigned together on saving the environment in 2018. I saw your sincerity firsthand, up close,\" Gaetz posted on X, directing his comments to DeSantis. \"Please use your excellent leadership skills to kill this anti-Florida Man initiative. Keep our parks natural.\"\n\nThere has also been pushback to past attempts to put golf corses in Florida state parks, with the general idea that people in the state are opposed to any additional development in those areas.\n\nTGR Design, Wood's Florida-based golf course design company, did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment, but four sources, including the DeSantis administration official, confirmed that it was involved in the early stages of the proposal.\n\nThe proposal was spearheaded by Folds of Honor, an Oklahoma-based non-profit organization that helps veterans. It uses golf, among other things, to raise scholarship money for families of members and first responders who were killed or disabled.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nTrump in damage-control mode over abortion backlash from the right\n\nFive takeaways from Harris' first major interview as the Democratic nominee\n\nThe real story behind the Harris-Trump hot mic feud\n\nThe group, which has floated the idea of golf courses in Florida state parks in the past, issued a statement last week confirming its involvement. It said the plan was to bring \"world class\" golf to Southeast Florida and donate proceeds to military and first-responder families.\n\nThe statement from the group was shared and amplified by nationally-known conservative firebrand Dan Bongino, who said the group personally assured him the proposal was not returning.\n\n\"My good friends at 'Folds of Honor' have also assured me that they do not plan to move forward on this project,\" Bongino, who lives in the area, wrote on social media. \"They are great people, doing great things. They just didn't understand the local passion for JD Park.\"\n\nA second lesser-known group, Delaware-based Tuskegee Dunes Foundation, earlier posted on a newly-created website that it was also behind the proposal, but it has since backed away.\n\n\"We have received clear feedback that Jonathan Dickinson State Park is not the right location,\" the group posted . \"We did not understand the local community landscape and appreciate the clarity. We will not pursue building in the beloved Jonathan Dickinson State Park.\"\n\nLittle is known about that group, which shared an Oklahoma address with Folds of Honor, but the group in January did hire two Florida lobbyists, including Ryan Matthews, the former head of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, which is the agency that would have had broad authority to move forward with the plan and whose leader DeSantis appoints.\n\nDeSantis' communications team initially supported the idea, even as public pushback grew.\n\nIn a statement last week, DeSantis press secretary Jeremy Redfern said that it was something former President Teddy Roosevelt, a well-known conservationist, would have supported.\n\n\"Teddy Roosevelt believed that public parks were for the benefit and enjoyment of the people, and we agree with him,\" Redfern said. \"No administration has done more than we have to conserve Florida's natural resources, grow conservation lands, and keep our environment pristine. But it's high time we made public lands more accessible to the public.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, though, DeSantis distanced himself from the proposal.\n\n\"It was not approved by me. I never saw that,\" he told reporters. \"A lot of that stuff was just half-baked, and it was not ready for prime time.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

DeSantis and they come in and the CEO, the chairman of the organization, is sitting there working on a puzzle for hours,\" said a Never Back Down staffer who was there.\n\nAnother Never Back Down staffer also said Wagner worked on it for \"hours\" in the week before Iowa.\n\nThe fact that one of the top people in charge of securing a win for DeSantis in Iowa was spending time on something unrelated to the caucuses was emblematic of the mismanagement and wasted efforts that many of DeSantis' own supporters say have plagued the campaign from the very beginning.\n\nIn a comment to NBC News, Wagner noted that the \"office puzzle\" was \"there when we arrived\" and \"became a sense of pride for the entire team and everyone chipped in a few minutes a piece to get it done.\"\n\n\"I could not be more proud of every person in our Iowa office. I came out to work with our Iowa team and our incredible COO Jordan Wiggins in person for the final two-week push in Iowa and I came away with a group of people I would go to war with any time, anywhere. We worked non-stop together on operations in terrible weather conditions,\" he said, adding, \"The operation worked nearly 24/7 throughout for the Gov and was absolutely seamless. I am so proud of what we achieved in Iowa and will achieve beyond.\"\n\nDeSantis came in second in Iowa, but he was still 30 percentage points behind former President Donald Trump, who captured more than 50% of the roughly 110,000 votes and had a historic margin of victory . Still, DeSantis tried to argue it was a huge win for him - and he has worked to lower expectations in New Hampshire, a state where he was never expected to be a strong competitor.\n\n\"I faced a barrage of $50 million attacking me and that - leading into Iowa, and we were able to scrape a second, which, under the circumstances, I think was good. However, Donald Trump posted the victory. So I think he's benefiting from momentum here,\" DeSantis told Fox News during an interview in New Hampshire on Friday. \"So we haven't spent very much money here. Nikki Haley is spending an inordinate amount of money here.\"\n\nDeSantis is now battling with the former United Nations ambassador to be the last person standing against Trump. But this isn't where he was supposed to be. In early 2023, DeSantis was widely seen as a formidable governor, a bright star of the Republican Party who could possibly take down Donald Trump - particularly after his landslide re-election victory in 2022.\n\nInstead, DeSantis is now facing a likely blowout in New Hampshire and massive public polling deficits in most of the early states - a nearly impossible path forward in his presidential bid.\n\nNBC News spoke to dozens of DeSantis' current and former staffers, as well as other supporters, about where the governor went wrong. They painted a picture of missteps from the very beginning:\n\nNBC News reached out to both the DeSantis campaign and Never Back Down for comment for this piece.\n\nA DeSantis adviser said that while the campaign did make a number of blunders, in the end, none of that may have been enough to overcome Trump.\n\n\"I think you have a combination of strategic errors throughout along with bad, bad early management, along with a candidate just too set in his ways,\" said the adviser, who was granted anonymity because they still work for him. \"At the end of the day, I would say that all mattered less than Trump. He was an overall force of nature. For all the Monday-morning quarterbacking that is coming, I don't know a scenario where he would have lost.\"\n\nDeSantis' presidential campaign was a mess from the moment it launched .\n\nThe Florida governor decided to do something different from the usual tightly choreographed announcement speech: He turned to the unpredictable social media platform once known as Twitter.\n\nDeSantis' May 24 rollout was widely panned and full of glitches . Twitter's servers apparently couldn't handle the traffic, and the Twitter Spaces app repeatedly crashed. The event with CEO Elon Musk was audio-only - depriving the candidate of photographs he could use in ads and fundraising pitches - and by the time of DeSantis' big announcement, much of the audience had clicked away.\n\nIt was intended to bolster his support with right-wing Twitter users, but the tech issues dominated the day.\n\nEven at the time, doubts were starting to creep up. Not everyone in DeSantis' inner circle agreed with the decision to launch with Musk.\n\n\"When they decided to do the Twitter Spaces launch, maybe then at that point, I knew they were stupid,\" one former Never Back Down adviser told NBC News.\n\nAnd after the failed launch, supporters - and even some staffers - started to wonder whether the campaign was the juggernaut it had promised to be.\n\n\"What harmed the campaign the most off the bat was that it didn't have a clear purpose and message,\" a former DeSantis campaign staffer said. \"No one really could articulate 'why Ron.'\"\n\n\"We were never given any idea of what the message we should be pushing was,\" one early DeSantis social media personality said of the campaign's lack of communication and strategy. \"It was a mess from the start.\"\n\nIt was just two weeks into the campaign, and already the squabbling had begun.\n\nThe campaign's top brass, including then-campaign manager Generra Peck, top adviser Ryan Tyson and Christina Pushaw - who was the architect of DeSantis' communications strategy - held a conference call with those tapped to be the social-media knife fighters on DeSantis' behalf. The group of roughly a dozen influencers was informally dubbed the \"fight club\" by the campaign. They were willing to combat members of the media and DeSantis' political foes, but from the very early weeks of the campaign, many were flummoxed by leadership's direction, or lack thereof.\n\n\"The conference call was a s--- show, just an absolute s--- show,\" said a former fight club member who was on the call. \"People [top staffers] were pressed on the message, and, especially after the failed rollout, they had no answers.\"\n\nDuring a particularly bizarre portion of the meeting, Bill Mitchell, a DeSantis supporter with a large social media following, asked the top DeSantis campaign staff if they could call Musk because he was concerned that the site was limiting the visibility of his posts - a practice commonly referred to as \"shadow-banning.\"\n\n\"He cut me off - I'll remember this to my dying day - and asked the top people on the campaign if they could call Elon Musk and ask why he is being shadow-banned,\" a second person on the call recounted. \"That was the level of people we were working with. It was just kind of embarrassing to a point.\"\n\nMitchell did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe call is a snapshot of what some of even DeSantis' closest advisers viewed as a campaign that was chaotic, rudderless and often without a coherent message. And when a message would briefly emerge, they told NBC News, it was often washed out by a tidal wave of self-inflicted negative headlines.\n\nThis pattern would play out over and over on the campaign. In early December, when DeSantis finally completed his tour of all 99 counties in Iowa - a moment that should bring nothing but good press - he instead had to deal with turmoil at Never Back Down, which was then naming its third CEO in two weeks .\n\nThe organization was set up to fund a massive ground game, but as the official campaign started to run low on cash, it became the driver for nearly all campaign activities, including coordinating events and running TV ad campaigns it never expected to have to fund.\n\nThe internal messaging chaos in the beginning was happening as the campaign also grappled with massive early spending problems exacerbated by Peck's decision to hire dozens of staffers much earlier than normal. Roughly 40% of those initial hires were let go just two months into the race.\n\n\"They realized the finances were a train wreck,\" one DeSantis adviser said. \"She built a juggernaut for the general election without considering they had a primary to get through.\"\n\nPeck was out by August, just three months into the campaign, in another of what had become a long line of debilitating \" resets \" that helped define DeSantis' early efforts. Peck declined to comment for this piece.\n\nDeSantis' camp realized its early \" long-haul \" strategy for going deep into the primary season was not sustainable after it stumbled out of the gate, and officials quickly shifted their focus and resources to Iowa.\n\nNever Back Down spent tens of millions of dollars building a ground game that ultimately included 1,500 precinct captains. It's that intense focus that makes DeSantis' significant loss in Iowa so damning to his ability to project viability moving forward.\n\nSeveral people interviewed by NBC News also pointed to the nearly seven months between DeSantis' re-election victory in November 2022 and the late-May launch of his presidential campaign.\n\n\"It was a total failure to launch,\" one former DeSantis adviser said. \"This thing blew up on the launch pad. They had six months to get ready for very serious strategic questions, the most important of which was how to deal with Donald Trump. They had no answers. We are nine months in, and they still have not figured it out.\"\n\nSome in DeSantis' early political orbit did press him to attack Trump from the get-go because they thought there was no way to beat him without engaging, but DeSantis' inner circle had other ideas. There was a continued belief at the time that support for Trump was \"soft,\" and if DeSantis did not anger Republican primary voters who previously supported Trump, those supporters would come over to him.\n\nThis lack of strategy for dealing with Trump played out early on - even before his presidential launch - when DeSantis commented on a possible Trump indictment in New York.\n\nHe criticized the investigation there as politically motivated, but he also repeated the allegations - albeit without naming the former president.\n\n\"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair. I just, I can't speak to that,\" he said at the time, a swipe that was seen as clumsy and criticized by both Trump allies and critics.\n\nThe former Never Back Down adviser said this was the first point where they became concerned that there might be problems.\n\n\"If you're going to pick a fight, pick a fight,\" this person said. \"Don't throw a punch and then run away and say you're not fighting. ... He had no idea how to be a candidate.\"\n\nAn early indicator of what would become DeSantis' campaign trajectory was when hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin decided he would no longer be backing DeSantis after he had given $10 million to his past gubernatorial campaigns. DeSantis' heavy focus on culture war fights, Griffin said, eventually turned him off.\n\n\"Losing Ken was big,\" a DeSantis donor said. \"And the bigger problem was it sent a signal to others.\"\n\nAs Haley began to strip supporters from DeSantis and his poll numbers stagnated, money became a significant struggle. DeSantis reported raising more than $20 million for his campaign during his first reporting period, but that number came with some flashing red lights - including the huge number of donors who had already given the maximum amount of money legally allowed.\n\nAfter that first wave of cash flowed into his official account, DeSantis struggled to raise money directly for his campaign. Instead, he relied on the Never Back Down super PAC to fund much of his early operations. The dynamic raised questions about the legality of using a super PAC, which cannot legally coordinate with a campaign, to run most important functions, including the campaign's ground game, most events and a bus tour that took DeSantis to all 99 counties in Iowa.\n\n\"Never [Back Down] PAC has for months coordinated its activities with and made in-kind contributions to DeSantis and his campaign committee, contravening the explicit legal requirement that super PACs must remain 'independent' of - i.e., not coordinate with or make contributions to - federal candidates or their campaigns,\" read a complaint from the Campaign Legal Center filed with the Federal Election Commission in December.\n\nA veteran Florida-based Republican operative who did not work for DeSantis said that he had conversations with those who did work for Never Back Down about being careful of the appearance of coordination.\n\n\"Yeah, there were those of us warning people who got involved with them late that it's a good idea to try and stay away from Never Back Down,\" a veteran Florida GOP operative said. \"It was clear they were playing with fire, and got much closer to -- if not clearly -- surpassing the fire wall you're not supposed to go past. It's a dangerous situation, and I'm not sure if Trump gets elected that his Department of Justice won't come knocking.\"\n\n\"He's not going to let DeSantis off the hook for anything,\" the person added.\n\nThe attempt to fund a presidential campaign almost exclusively through a super PAC was a fairly novel concept, and one that gave outsized power to Jeff Roe, a longtime Republican political operative who became a controversial figure as he continued to get in squabbles with members of the super PAC who were perceived to be closer to DeSantis' inner circle.\n\nIt created a sort of Tallahassee vs the world dynamic, with DeSantis' greatest amount of trust left in the hands of the consultants and operatives he had known the longest. No one in that group, however, had ever been involved in a presidential campaign. That team initially tried to replicate the playbook for DeSantis' massive 2022 re-election win, a move that seemed naive to outsiders brought in early in the campaign.\n\n\"The blunt truth is that DeSantis' presidential campaign was sabotaged through early incompetence in Tallahassee,\" the person said. \"There was a brief chance to reset things, but additional missteps mortally wounded the campaign in its infancy.\"\n\nConversely, there was a growing sense among other DeSantis advisers that Roe and Never Back Down wasted more than $100 million in donor cash with little to show for the effort.\n\nEventually the power struggle started to center on Roe versus Wagner, the South Florida attorney and longtime DeSantis ally who sat on the group's board. NBC News reported the two openly feuded at times before Roe finally left the organization he helped build in mid-December.\n\nThe difference between the Tallahassee set and the wider Never Back Down world often played out in media interactions, with the former significantly more distrustful of engaging with the traditional press.\n\nBut DeSantis has already started to look back on his campaign and admitted that some things could have been done differently - including adjusting the earlier strategy of shunning much of the media.\n\n\"I came in not really doing as much media. I should have just been blanketing,\" he told conservative host Hugh Hewitt Thursday. \"I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything. I started doing that as we got into the end of the summer, and we did it. But we had an opportunity, I think, to come out of the gate and do that and reach a much broader folk.\"\n\nNever Back Down banked on a massive door-knocking effort being the lynchpin of an effort to dethrone Trump. It was so confident in the plan that it invited reporters to Iowa to show off its training center there .\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThree people who worked on the door-to-door effort in early states told NBC News they ran into staunch resistance from Trump voters who showed no sign of budging. They also said the super PAC focused too heavily on targeting rural voters as opposed to zeroing in on the suburbs, which may have been warmer to DeSantis' campaign. And by dispatching door-knockers from all over the country, the effort lost the kind of local feel that grassroots activists said is key to a successful canvassing campaign.\n\n\"I'm not saying it's not possible, but most of these guys that are getting down off of their tractor, when our guys pull it up on their property, they're voting for Trump,\" one person who formerly worked on the effort said. \"And they're not going to change their mind.\"\n\nAs of late last month, Never Back Down boasted of knocking on nearly three million doors across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Jess Szymanski, a spokesperson for the PAC, said DeSantis' opponents would \"stop at nothing to undermine the fact that we've built the largest, most advanced grassroots and political operation in the history of presidential politics.\"\n\nHeaded into New Hampshire, DeSantis was polling in the single digits and Trump had a commanding lead in South Carolina, a state where Haley previously served as governor and held a significant lead over DeSantis in most public polling.\n\nNow, DeSantis' best path to the nomination isn't through Trump, but around him. Three people in DeSantis' orbit told NBC News that the most logical path for the governor of Florida, at this point, is to block Haley from winning in New Hampshire, beat her in South Carolina and position himself as the clear lead alternative to Trump in the event his legal peril or age prevents him from making it to November.\n\n\"I think that's the case,\" a DeSantis supporter said. \"He believes there are multiple scenarios where Trump wouldn't be the nominee.\"\n\nA second DeSantis ally said they're \"not totally convinced\" it's not a good idea for DeSantis to \"stay in as long as humanly possible just because of the unknown that is Trump in his situation.\"\n\n\"Their path forward is to stay in and hope that something either legally, or from a health perspective, occurs that removes Trump from the race,\" the person who was involved with the Never Back Down effort said.\n\nIn any case, the campaign and its aligned committees are on cash fumes, a point made clear by the fact that it did not have any TV ad reservations in New Hampshire or South Carolina in the closing weeks of January, and had drastically scaled back its ground game efforts in both states.\n\nIn another sign of dysfunction, a person who was involved with the Never Back Down effort - and who still supports the governor - said that in recent days, a staffer tried to contact a firm to buy lists of voters in South Carolina. The problem was they already had voter lists in that state.\n\n\"They were trying to buy the file from a different company because either they don't know that they own it or they don't know how to access it and they're afraid to ask,\" the person said.\n\nThe campaign, at times, felt like it was starting to ramp down even as DeSantis and his team tried to continue to project a long-haul strategy they likely could not afford to executive unless Haley drastically underperformed in both South Carolina and New Hampshire.\n\nEven before Iowa, there was a sense of resignation setting in over large swaths of the DeSantis' campaign and aligned super PACs, but after his drubbing in that first-in-the national nominating contest, an exhaustion and hope for the end started to settle in amongst his top advisers.\n\nDeSantis spent months plotting out a presidential campaign on the heels of his 2022 win, and he had all the momentum and the money as the 2024 election cycle started in earnest. But none of those best-laid plans came to fruition.\n\n\"Hopefully, it'll be over soon,\" the operative who formerly worked on the Never Back Down effort said. \"I'm just really tired of all the infighting and all the folks going back and forth about this. It's done. He's not going to win it. If you are serious about not wanting Trump to be the nominee, as much as it pains me to say this at this point, I think all the energy goes to Nikki Haley. And I guess you try to ride that train.\"\n\n\"But,\" they added, \"that's probably not going to work out too well, either.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "'We knew the numbers were bad': Law enforcement staff raised concerns about Ron DeSantis' top crime talking point\n\nFlorida's top law enforcement officials were repeatedly warned by their own staff that Gov. Ron DeSantis' claim that the state's crime rate is at a 50-year low - a message he often uses as part of his presidential campaign - was based on incomplete data that makes the accuracy of the claim impossible to verify.\n\nDespite those warnings, DeSantis continued to promote the numbers on the campaign trail, three former officials with Florida's Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\n\"The ethics of what we were reporting, we knew the numbers were bad,\" a former FDLE employee told NBC News. \"We foot-stomped it to leadership over and over again; they did not care. They did not care.\"\n\n\"We were soldiers, though,\" the person said, adding that the department's bosses asked staff members to produce numbers even though the staff members had doubts about them - still, \"we did it.\"\n\nEach of the former FLDE employees said there was a pervasive sense among agency staff that the numbers needed to say what their leadership wanted - and that those demands were coming from the governor's office for political reasons.\n\nNBC News granted all three anonymity to speak freely due to concerns about professional retribution.\n\n\"The numbers gave the governor and the [executive office of governor] what they wanted,\" one of the former FDLE staffers said. \"They were looking for a particular narrative.\"\n\nMore exclusive coverage of DeSantis' crime data on Hallie Jackson NOW, 5 p.m. ET on NBC News Now.\n\nRank-and-file staffers raised objections on more than one occasion.\n\n\"The governor's office wanted to say outright that we were at a 50-year crime low and we told department leadership, verbally and in writing, that was not accurate because of the deficiencies in the data,\" one of the former staffers said. \"We went back and forth several times and we agreed, after being heavily pushed, to say we were trending in that direction.\"\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger defended the 50-year low crime rate statistic.\n\n\"Florida's crime rate is indeed at a 50-year low, and criticism about FDLE's robust data collection methods is unfounded,\" Plessinger said. \"Despite your assertions, no current or former employee has ever expressed concerns to FDLE leadership regarding the calculations.\"\n\nThe incomplete data stems from Florida's attempts to transition how it reports crime stats to comply with federal standards. Since the 1970s, the state has reported on a \"summary\" basis, which means that if one incident produced multiple crimes, only the most serious was reported as part of Florida's Uniform Crime Report. Starting in 2021, the federal government stopped accepting summary data, forcing every state to transition to \"incident-based\" reporting, which captured dozens of additional crimes.\n\n\"As a result of the change in reporting methodology, we gain a greater visibility into crimes that have been occurring but have not previously been included in summary reports, such as, drug offenses, fraud, gambling, or human trafficking,\" read department documents from 2022 offering an internal explanation of the changes.\n\nThe changes required a lot more technical reporting from Florida's more than 400 local law enforcement agencies, some of which remain unable to produce that level of detail until they get costly technology upgrades.\n\nAs a result, many are not yet reporting. Law enforcement agencies representing just 57 percent of the state's population initially reported under the new system, FDLE records reviewed by NBC News show, meaning law enforcement agencies representing more than 40 percent of the state are not reporting specific data. For those agencies, the state uses \"imputed data\" - an algorithm to estimate what the crime statistics would show, based on mathematical modeling that considers things like past performance.\n\n\"It is used because a larger percentage of law enforcement agencies do not submit crime stats,\" said Richard Boylan, an economics professor at Rice University who has studied the use of imputed data, which is commonly used across the country in crime statistics reporting.\n\nDespite the incomplete data, DeSantis has widely, without any context, used the numbers as part of his political speeches  - both as governor and a presidential candidate - to bolster his tough-on-crime résumé, even as officials were warning that the data did not necessarily reflect what he was claiming it did.\n\n\"Crime is at a 50-year low in Florida,\" DeSantis said during the first GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee in a back-and-forth with Fox News moderator Bret Baier.\n\nHe also cited the statistic during his presidential campaign launch in May.\n\nThe governor's staff \"wanted us to pull the data to try and justify that stuff, and FDLE originally pushed back saying 'we really could not do that,'\" said one of the former FDLE staffers. \"We argued it should not be done.\"\n\nDespite their objections, the data made its way into DeSantis' public comments.\n\nRead more on NBC News\n\nBoylan said that Florida's numbers should be viewed with a skeptical eye because both a large percentage of the crime data is based on imputed data, and because there is no legal requirement for local agencies to report crime data to the state.\n\n\"Crime goes up once states require the reporting,\" Boylan said. \"Florida does not have a law requiring reporting, so I would think that is an additional reason to be skeptical about the Florida data.\"\n\nDeSantis has faced public criticism for his crime data as well. In July, Brookings Metro researchers Hanna Love and Tracy Hadden Loh wrote in Time Magazine that the governor could not credibly say the state was at a 50-year crime rate low because of the reporting issues. The Marshall Project has also pointed out that DeSantis is relying on \" patchy, incomplete crime data \" and that the state's participation rate \"is the lowest of any state in the country.\"\n\n\"DeSantis can't be sure that Florida has achieved 50-year crime rate lows because the state itself doesn't know what its crime trends are, due to flawed data,\" they wrote.\n\n\"These methodological clashes in Florida's crime reporting create gaps in information that make it difficult to definitively claim any statewide crime trends - let alone that the state has reached '50-year-crime rate lows,'\" they added.\n\nIn other words, the crime rate could be what DeSantis is saying it is - but there's no way to know that definitively based on currently available data.\n\nDeSantis' office did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nIn June, FDLE defended its method for filling in data gaps.\n\n\"The methodology used by FDLE statisticians is statistically sound and accurately represents the trend of the crime rate in Florida,\" a department spokesperson told the Marshall Project , a nonprofit journalism organization focused on criminal justice. \"The methodology used by FDLE is similar to that used by the FBI.\"\n\nThe use of incomplete crime statistics on the campaign trail is the latest example of what some former and current FDLE officials see as the overt politicization of the state's top law enforcement agency.\n\nIn June, NBC News reported that FDLE was diverting a large amount of additional resources toward DeSantis, including spending millions of dollars more on his security as he increased national travel ahead of announcing his run for president in late May.\n\nAt that time, DeSantis' office said the increase had nothing to do with the governor preparing to run for president and blamed past leadership at the agency for having \"failed to request\" the \"necessary additional resources.\"\n\nJust months later, however, an annual report showed that spending to protect the governor had jumped to $10 million - a $3 million increase from the previous fiscal year. The governor's office attributed the increased resources to the need to protect DeSantis.\n\n\"His record as the most effective conservative governor in American history has also earned him an elevated threat profile and FDLE has increased the number of protective agents to ensure the governor and his family remain safe,\" his office said at the time.\n\nFDLE has also played a central role in enforcing DeSantis' immigration policies, which have been a key part of his political identity and something he has regularly used to attack President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nFDLE agents have been dispatched to the southern border to help Texas with migrants coming into the country illegally, and they were also part of a mission in the Florida Keys to try to head off migrants coming mostly from Cuba.\n\nNBC News reported in August that the Florida Keys mission in particular drew pushback from FDLE agents in the department's aviation unit because, as part of that mission, they were being asked to fly just 1,000 feet off the water many miles off the coast, according to internal records reviewed by NBC News. Those flights were both against FDLE's own policies, according to internal documents, and put agents' lives in danger.\n\n\"It is an unacceptable level of risk for a pilot,\" John Cox, an aviation expert, told NBC News at the time.\n\nBased on those pilot concerns, FDLE has since leased a larger plane more suited for the Key West immigration missions, NBC News reported in August , but there remains an overwhelming sense from some that the FDLE has become far too politicized under DeSantis.\n\n\"There has been a push of trying to get FDLE to focus on topics the governor has highlighted, specifically immigration as the primary one,\" Jim Madden, a retired FDLE assistant commissioner, told NBC News in June. \"It is sad. We have fought those battles over the years about agency priorities and where it should focus, but right now in my mind, leadership there is just wholly inadequate.\"\n\n\"There is no solid independence with the agency,\" he added.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

I'm not a No. 2 guy,\" DeSantis said on the \"Wisconsin Right Now\" radio show, saying he would rather stay on as governor because the vice presidency \"doesn't really have any authority.\"\n\nAsked about his own thoughts on a running mate, DeSantis said, \"It's a little bit presumptuous to be doing that at this stage.\"\n\n\"I'm here to win the early primaries, and that's what we've got to do first,\" he added.\n\nDeSantis has been sharpening his criticisms of Trump.

      "text": "Florida Gov. DeSantis Floats His Wife as Next Governor\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declined on Feb. 24 to endorse Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) as his successor while lauding his wife, Casey DeSantis, for the role.\n\nAsked about his view on Donalds, DeSantis noted that President Donald Trump had just recently entered office and he will need the support of every Republican in Congress.\n\n\"I want these congressmen focused on enacting his agenda. They haven't done very much yet. They're not putting his executive orders into place. We'll see what they do on the spending. But we have such a narrow majority that to be trying to campaign other places and missing these votes is not something I think is advisable at all,\" DeSantis, who ran against Trump in 2024 before dropping out and endorsing the president, told reporters at an unrelated press briefing.\n\n\"The reality is, we've achieved victories in Florida. We need to start achieving those victories up there [in Washington]. So I think people look at it and say, you got a guy like Byron-he just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left in these last years. He's just not been a part of it. He's been in other states campaigning, and that's fine, but okay, deliver results up there. That's what I want to see,\" the governor added.\n\nA spokesman for Donalds did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDonalds has not yet launched a gubernatorial bid, but Trump said if he does, the congressman would have his \"complete and total endorsement.\"\n\nTrump wrote on social media at the time, \"As Governor, Byron would have a BIG Voice and would work closely with me to advance our America First Agenda.\"\n\nDonalds was a state representative from 2016 to 2020 when he won an open race to represent Florida's 19th District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Donalds has handily won reelection twice.\n\nDeSantis, a former congressman, narrowly won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by less than 33,000 votes. In 2022, he triumphed with nearly 60 percent of the vote share.\n\nFlorida law does not allow governors to serve more than two consecutive terms, preventing DeSantis from running in 2026.\n\nDeSantis told reporters on Monday that people think Republicans are safe now in Florida but he doesn't think that notion is true.\n\n\"We could revert very quickly. That could happen. 100 percent. So it really needs to be okay, are you going to be somebody that's going to fight for people, especially when it's not easy,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis declined to discuss Florida Lt. Gov Jeanette Nuñez, 52, but said, unprompted, that people ask him all the time about Florida's first lady.\n\n\"There's been a lot of people ... chattering about her [Casey] running,\" he said.\n\nHe added later: \"I won by the biggest margin that any Republican has ever won a governor's race here in Florida. She would do better than me. That would happen. She's somebody that has the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles that you know anything that we've accomplished she'd be able to take to the next level.\"\n\nDeSantis recalled Rush Limbaugh, the late conservative radio host, approaching him after speaking with his wife.\n\n\"He put his finger in my chest, [and] he's like 'the only person I would rather have as my governor than you is her,'\" DeSantis said. \"And that's a pretty good endorsement there.\"\n\nCasey DeSantis, 44, a former news journalist, has not yet announced a campaign. Neither has she ruled one out."

      "text": "DeSantis Summarizes 6 Years of Achievements in State of the State Address\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla.-Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis gave his penultimate State of the State Address to a joint session of the state Legislature on March 4, in which he championed the work his team has accomplished in the last six years, and emphasized the challenges they still face in the final regular session of his administration.\n\n\"We chose freedom over fear; education over indoctrination; law and order over rioting and disorder,\" he said. \"We are proud of our state's accomplishments while we recognize the work that lies ahead.\"\n\n\"We can-and we must-continue to lead,\" he added.\n\nThe governor's touted Florida leadership in terms of immigration, economy and business, education, environmental restoration, and taxes.\n\nHe praised the Legislature for several of its accomplishments over the years, including but not limited to banning communist China from buying land in the state, enacting a digital bill of rights as well as parental rights in education, protecting Floridians against a central bank digital currency, divesting state holdings from China-based banks and investment firms, as well as from firms that pushed environmental social governance (ESG), and the pro-life heartbeat bill.\n\nHowever, he called for his fellow lawmakers to work on fulfilling still incomplete projects for Floridans where needed. That incomplete work is found, he said, primarily in their homes, their environment, their education, protection of their second amendment rights, and petition reform.\n\nPetition reform was originally slated to be addressed during the special session called at the beginning of the year but was pushed back to the regular session. It comes after widespread petition fraud was uncovered in connection with efforts to collect enough signatures to get two issues on state ballots in November 2024: constitutional amendments protecting abortion access and legalizing recreational marijuana use.\n\n\"We need to clean up the petition fraud, and we need to clean up this out-of-control amendment process, and you and the Legislature have the opportunity to do just that and protect Florida's Constitution once and for all,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis called once again for the Legislature to address the needs of Florida's condominium owners amid rising assessment costs.\n\nHe also spoke out in favor of eliminating tax on business rent and efforts being considered by the Legislature to eliminate property taxes via a proposed ballot amendment.\n\n\"You buy a home, pay off a mortgage-and yet you still have to write a check to the government every year just to live on your own property,\" he said. \"Is the property yours or are you just renting from the government?\"\n\nAlong with his call to improve conditions for Floridians' individual homes came a call to finish ongoing improvements to their collective natural home.\n\nFlorida's Everglades restoration project, he said, needs to be completed, and the Trump administration is receptive to just granting the money to Florida instead of allocating it to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\"We promised to leave Florida to God better than we found, and we are doing just that,\" he said.\n\n\"Florida time is faster than Army Corps of Engineers time,\" he added.\n\nThe governor then requested of the Legislature to work on expanding laws protecting residents' Second Amendment rights. While the state allows permitless concealed carry, the state still lacks constitutional open carry laws.\n\nHe called for a Second Amendment-specific tax holiday, allowing for Floridians to stock up on guns, ammunition, and other gun-related items.\n\nAs for the momentum he hopes to maintain, DeSantis praised the continued reform work of bringing down property insurance rates and helping Floridians get back on their feet after disastrous hurricanes.\n\n\"The fact is that the Legislature has devoted more time and effort to address insurance reforms over the past few years than at any other time in the history of Florida,\" he said. \"I hope that the Legislature continues these efforts by providing funding for those on the My Safe Florida Home waitlist-these grants have helped tens of thousands harden their homes and generate rate relief.\"\n\nThe governor gave praise to ongoing education reforms across the state as well, and urged the Legislature to further increase efforts to recruit new teachers.\n\n\"Our universal school choice program works-families and students have benefitted, and the academic bar has been raised throughout the state,\" he said.\n\nThis regular session comes after a special session that saw the passing of anti-illegal immigration legislation and the governor, speaker of the House, and Senate president all mentioned that in their opening remarks.\n\n\"No state has done more, and no state did it sooner than we did in Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"Thanks to the recent legislation, it is now a crime to enter Florida illegally, the days of catch and release are over, and all state and local law enforcement have a duty to assist in interior immigration enforcement efforts.\n\n\"The voters have spoken-and Florida has responded. We will be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\"\n\nBut not all were left impressed. Senate Minority Leader Jason Pizzo gave an off-the-cuff rebuttal immediately after DeSantis's address, and asked, in the spirit of looking back on the Republican's track record in the state, why now did all of the social issues of DEI, ESG, and immigration, as well as infrastructure suddenly become a problem?\n\n\"I wondered how, with more than 30 years of majority control of the Legislature and executive branches, how any of these issues were so insidious that they festered into such an instant concern,\" he said. \"Or rather, how did a generation of Republican predecessors allow us to get to this place?\"\n\nPizzo pointed out that he was the first state senator to introduce a bill expanding e-verify measures to all employees in the state, a measure that his Republican colleagues failed to include in the bill pushed forward during the special session.\n\nE-verify requires private employers with 25 or more employees to verify the immigration status of new hires.\n\n\"You are not serious about probing legal immigration if you continue to cower to donors and not listen to our citizens,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the senator ended his short address with hope of a unified Legislature, affirming he was ready to back the agenda put forward by Senate President Ben Albritton, which will focus on families, economic growth, protecting Florida's children, and demanding efficiency in government spending.\n\n\"I pledge my absolute commitment that if we can focus on this agenda, there need not be an ideology or even an aisle that divides us,\" he said."

      "text": "DeSantis, Homan Call for Congress to Pass Legal Immigration Reforms\n\nSARASOTA, Fla.-Changes need to be made to the United States legal immigration system as well as stopping illegal border crossers, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, border czar Tom Homan, and former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.\n\nThey said that is especially true when it comes to distributing visas.\n\nThere are legal ways for different types of workers, like seasonal workers and agricultural workers, to come work in the country, Wolf said during a roundtable panel hosted by New College of Florida on March 20.\n\nThose legal outlets have been mismanaged and abused over time, he said, and they need to be updated by Congress to create \"the right workforce\" in the country.\n\n\"Congress actually needs to do its job and ... reform the legal immigration system so that we have workers here for the economy that is built today, not an economy of three decades ago,\" he said. \"And so it just doesn't work.\"\n\nTwo of those visas specifically mentioned during their remarks were the H-1B visa and the H-2A visa.\n\nThe H-1B is used to bring in skilled laborers, which is utilized significantly by tech companies to bring Asian employees stateside, while the H-2A is the temporary agricultural visa.\n\nAll three appeared to speak out in support of allowing a legitimate seasonal labor force that comes into the country for a time and then goes home after their work is done.\n\nThey all said they see a way of enforcing that is by making e-verify, the process a company has to go through to verify the legal status of every one of their employees, mandatory.\n\nDeSantis said that temporary work visas like the H-2A without mandatory e-verify have incentivized more illegal immigrant labor forces as \"a way to just have dirt cheap labor and then export all the associated costs with that to the general public.\"\n\n\"Basically, it's a business that is socializing the cost of its operation to taxpayers,\" he said to the audience members. \"Because [when] you bring in someone illegally, who pays for their health care if something goes wrong? You do.\"\n\nE-verify is already partially mandatory in the state, and bipartisan efforts are underway in Tallahassee to require every employee to be subject to that vetting process.\n\nThe governor also suggested that young Americans can start going back to work to fill these part-time, low-skilled labor jobs.\n\nDeSantis said abuses exist in the use of H-1B visas as well, stating that the visa holders are essentially indebted to the hiring company, working exclusively there for a significant period of time for less pay.\n\nHe cited a recent situation in Florida where American employees had to train their H-1B replacement before being let go.\n\nHoman, meanwhile, joked about being in the \"exporting business\" regarding immigration rather than importing and said he agreed with what DeSantis and Wolf had said.\n\nHe disclosed that when he was re-roofing his home, he had to go through several companies until he found one that could guarantee a fully legal workforce.\n\nHe said that one builder had hired 20 U.S. citizens to work for $20 an hour but had to let them go as all of his competitors were paying illegal immigrants at a rate of $7 an hour.\n\nThis is about keeping wages at a certain level, and keeping Americans employed, he said. There is a way to bring people in legally and improve these systems, but Congress needs to act."

      "text": "DeSantis Launches Florida's Own Version of DOGE\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that he is launching a state version of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative.\n\nLike its counterpart at the federal level, Florida's DOGE will advise on downsizing government and making what's left run more efficiently, he said.\n\nAt a press conference in Tampa, DeSantis said that Florida's DOGE task force will operate for one year before being dissolved, with a mandate to cut red tape and ensure that taxpayer dollars aren't wasted.\n\nFlorida DOGE will \"implement a multi-pronged approach to eliminating bureaucratic bloat and modernizing our state government to best serve the people of Florida in the years ahead,\" the governor said.\n\n\"We've already been doing this stuff,\" DeSantis said. \"This will really help enhance that.\"\n\nDeSantis said he wants the task force to help eliminate 70 boards and commissions with 900 associated positions, in addition to the 740 positions he is already proposing to eliminate in the next budget.\n\n\"There's hundreds of these things. A lot of people have never heard of them, but they're there,\" DeSantis said.\n\nFlorida's DOGE task force will audit state agencies using a combination of artificial intelligence and IT experts to scrutinize contracts for backdoor funding of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) funding.\n\nCiting rising spending and tax hikes at all levels, DeSantis said the task force will analyze local public budget records and seek legislative authority to enforce compliance from local governments.\n\nPublic universities will also be subjected to an independent review and audit, DeSantis said.\n\n\"We will conduct a deep dive of all facets of university operations and spending, including debt and financial management practices, and make recommendations to the Board of Governors to consider and implement pathways to eliminate any unnecessary spending,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking alongside the governor, state Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said that various efficiency-seeking and anti-DEI initiatives are already in place in Florida. He said the state is in the top ranks of education and has been No. 1 in higher education for eight years in a row.\n\n\"We know we can't rest on our laurels ... when it comes to providing high-quality education, our public institutions, and reducing administrative bloat,\" Diaz said. \"That is why I wholeheartedly support the governor's mission to review higher education spending.\"\n\nThe commissioner said in half-jest that while many other states push students into \"zombie studies\" programs that don't provide a solid foundation for their future careers, Florida has long been focused on \"the workforce and the needs of our economies,\" with Florida DOGE aiming to accelerate those efforts.\n\n\"We will review every dollar spent at our public institutions, ensuring that all programs and administrators are laser-focused on improving student outcomes, which is what the money should be spent on,\" he said.\n\nRecapping his vision, DeSantis joked that the Elon Musk-led federal DOGE could learn a thing or two from Florida's experience.\n\n\"I do think this is something that can be very meaningful and we'll continue leading the way,\" DeSantis said. \"And the bottom line is-you know you see what they need to do in Washington to try to right the ship. If they just make America operate like Florida we will be in a much better situation.\""

      "text": "DeSantis Responds to Claims FEMA Can Keep People From Their Homes\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday responded to claims on social media suggesting that federal officials will not allow residents back in their homes after Hurricane Milton, which is now a Category 1 storm and is expected to move east over the Atlantic Ocean later Thursday.\n\nThe governor denied those claims, saying that his administration is in charge of the hurricane response, not the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It's not clear where those rumors originated.\n\n\"We live in an era where if you put out crap online, you can get a lot of people to share it and you can monetize that. That's just the way it is,\" DeSantis told the news conference, adding that \"in the state of Florida none of that stuff would ever fly.\"\n\n\"FEMA is not leading this show, we are leading this show here in the state of Florida,\" he said. \"We're marshaling whatever assets are available to us, we're leveraging that.\"\n\nDeSantis said that there will not \"be anything where FEMA is ever going to be able to keep you from your home,\" before adding a word of caution.\n\n\"Be careful about the nonsense that gets circulated, and just know that the more titillating it is, the more likely somebody is making money off it,\" he said. Those people don't care \"about the well-being and safety of the people that are actually in the eye of this storm, it's all just trying to monetize what they're doing,\" the governor continued.\n\n\"If the results of the inspection deem your home uninhabitable, that information is only used to determine the amount of FEMA assistance you may receive to make your home safe, sanitary and functional,\" the FEMA page says.\n\nHurricane Milton made landfall Category 3 storm on Wednesday evening, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm was once a Category 5 but has since weakened, although it is still considered a \"major\" hurricane.\n\nThe storm prompted the evacuation of millions of people along Florida's Gulf Coast this week. Officials had warned that people living in storm surge-prone areas along the coast should flee or risk death.\n\nThere have also been reports from North Carolina residents who have claimed that FEMA has blocked off roads or has not provided enough relief in Helene's aftermath. The Epoch Times has been unable to independently verify those claims.\n\nThe director of the agency Deanne Criswell has pushed back on the criticism by telling ABC News on Sunday that such statements are \"not helpful\" and are \"demoralizing to all of the first responders that have been out there in their communities helping people.\"\n\n\"We don't have enough money to continue throughout the rest of the year,\" she told Fox News, adding that her agency has been \"able to anticipate last year, this year, and even going into next year, that we are not going to have enough to pay all of the recovery bills.\""

      "text": "This article is taken from The Free Press ' s daily newsletter. To get the best of the news delivered to your inbox every morning, sign up here:\n\nRon DeSantis was supposed to be Serious Trump. Maybe a little lawyer-ish, a little stiff. But so what? Stiff meant competent. And wasn't that what Republicans wanted? Didn't they want to build the wall? Crush the administrative state? Just with a little less bluster?\n\nRecall that after the Republicans' disappointing 2022 midterms, DeSantis became the party's \"presumptive nominee\" in 2024. On a night when 11 of the 21 candidates endorsed by Donald Trump lost-including Blake Masters in Arizona, Herschel Walker in Georgia, and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania-DeSantis expanded on his 2018 win by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nSeven months later, the Florida governor announced his presidential bid-in a very rocky Twitter Space rollout with Elon Musk-and soon after, he decamped to Iowa, racking up the endorsements of the state's Republican governor, tons of state senators and representatives, and the highly coveted Bob Vander Plaats , the influential evangelical leader.\n\nHe did everything he was supposed to-and it wasn't what Republican voters wanted.\n\nThey wanted the Duck à L'Orange, and they seemed convinced that anyone who wasn't him was a squish.\n\nWhich is why Donald Trump trounced the whole Republican pack Monday in Iowa. At the time of writing, DeSantis looked like he'd come out on top in a close tussle with Nikki Haley for a distant second place. Little consolation given the expectations for his candidacy a year ago.\n\nTeam DeSantis insists that a big part of the problem is the conservative media ecosystem, and they're not wrong. How else could their candidate lose?\n\nAs DeSantis said of Trump last week while stumping: \"He's got basically a Praetorian Guard of the conservative media-Fox News, the websites, all this stuff. They don't hold him accountable because they're worried about losing viewers, and they don't want to have their ratings to go down.\"\n\nFew defeats more powerfully illustrate what we've known since 2016: that the old rules no longer matter, that no one cares if you did a brilliant job holding down the proverbial fort in Florida. What they care about is that you not simply enact, but, more importantly, embody your agenda. If you're not angry enough-or entertaining enough-then your agenda isn't a real agenda. It's a fake politics probably conjured up by some deep-state AI.\n\nFinal thought: it's utterly mystifying how it is that this keeps happening, that the politicians are still playing catch-up eight-and-a-half years after Trump descended his gilded escalator, that they have yet to intuit what he knew way back when-that America is broken and coasting and cracking up, and if you're still adhering to the stale strictures, you don't really get it.\n\nRon DeSantis was supposed to implement the Trump agenda and make his party serious again and forge a national coalition that would bring together conservatives and economic populists and maybe even a few old-fashioned liberals, and he failed because he didn't grasp how deep the rage runs.\n\nFor now, alas, only one man in the race gets that.\n\nPeter Savodnik is a writer and editor for The Free Press.

      "text": "MIAMI-It's almost 11 p.m. on a recent Friday night at ONE Gentlemens Club, and it's dead except for the girls in their thongs, sitting on pleather couches, waiting for someone to give a lap dance to. No one can talk to anyone else. It's too loud for that, what with the electronic drum, the incessant rapping. The rap is supposed to inspire twerking-and tens. Tonight, no one's twerking.\n\nTory Williams is alone at the bar in fishnets and boots. She should be mixing drinks.\n\n\"Did you vote in the recent election?\" I write in my notebook, then pass it to her.\n\nShe nods. When I ask who she voted for, a grin appears. \"DUH-SAN-TIS,\" she mouths.\n\n\"Why DeSantis?\" I shout. Williams is a black woman who looks to be pushing forty. She has a fiancé and, after two slow years, a job. It was her brother, she says, who made her rethink her politics.\n\nFinally, she shouts back, over the bar, through the din: \"Money.\"\n\nWilliams is one of the DeSantis Democrats: Florida voters who, until recently, identified as Democrats but in November opted to reelect Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis-he who resisted the Covid lockdowns, tangled with Disney, and governed with a record budget surplus -in a landslide.\n\nIt's unclear how many DeSantis Democrats there are: DeSantis' vote count jumped from roughly 4 million in 2018 to 4.6 million in 2022. Lots of those voters are presumably independents or Republicans who didn't vote last time.\n\nBut some are disaffected Democrats alienated from the party they once belonged to. That's evident from the longtime Democratic strongholds that DeSantis flipped, including Hillsborough, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade, where DeSantis skyrocketed from a 21-point loss in 2018 to an 11-point win in 2022-a net gain of more than 30 percentage points.\n\nDemocratic Palm Beach County Commissioner Dave Kerner says he identifies as a DeSantis Democrat, \"and I can tell you I'm not the only one.\"\n\n\"As I traveled around the state and throughout my county over the past several years, at first it was quiet, you know, 'This governor is doing a great job'-and this is amongst my Democratic colleagues,\" he told me. \"Then I started hearing it more and hearing it more. And then I saw my own county-which has been majority blue throughout probably its entire history-we saw more people vote for the Republican candidate over the Democratic candidate.\"\n\nKerner is 39, a former cop, and a former member of Florida's House of Representatives. He's best known for successfully strangling a bill , strongly backed by the National Rifle Association, that would have made it harder to prosecute anyone in a Stand Your Ground-related shooting. In 2022, he says, he backed DeSantis because he's not anti-cop. And because, Kerner says, he makes things happen. \"It wasn't necessarily about partisan identity but the man himself-even if you didn't agree with his policies, the way that he was so effective,\" he says.\n\nThe big question is whether people like Kerner are just one-time Republican voters, or if they'll become permanent Republicans. Whether people Tory Williams can be convinced to keep voting for a party that, until a few months ago, she never imagined voting for.\n\nHelen Aguirre Ferré, a former DeSantis spokesperson who is now the executive director of the Republican Party of Florida, tells me: \"We've had this great, big historical result, and it's on us now to continue and make sure that this is something that transcends beyond just one election.\"\n\nIn other words: Are there DeSantis Democrats elsewhere in America waiting to vote for the man in 2024?\n\nThese voters are not all that dissimilar to the Reagan Democrats who fueled the Republican's 1980 White House victory.\n\nLike the Reagan Democrats, the DeSantis Democrats feel condescended to, abandoned by the progressive elites who bankroll Democratic candidates and shape the party's agenda.\n\nThen, like now, inflation was out of control. Then, like now, the leadership in Washington seemed tired, out of ideas. Then, like now, the country seemed adrift. In 1980, America was losing ground to the communists in Afghanistan and Nicaragua, to the mullahs in Iran. In 2022, it is gripped by a polarization and economic stratification that have been building for years, with eight in ten Americans dissatisfied with how things are going, and two in five fearful a second civil war is on the horizon.\n\nBut the DeSantis Democrats, unlike Reagan Democrats, who were mostly white with blue-collar jobs and high school degrees, are not an easily identifiable species. They are not confined to any class, constituency or ethnic category-although Democratic pollsters say Latinos were more likely to flip for DeSantis. They stretch across the city, from Little Havana east to Miami Beach, and south toward Palmetto Bay, and north, to the Cubans and Dominicans and Colombians in Hialeah. DeSantis led the Latino vote by almost 20 points, according to CNN exit polling .\n\nDeSantis, unlike Ronald Reagan, is a supremely practical man. To the two dozen Floridians interviewed for this story, the governor is more defined by his actions than his ideology: He kept the schools open and taxes low. Period. Even the culture-war bombs he's tossed-like going head to head with the Magic Kingdom over the so-called Don't Say Gay bill-served to squeeze tax dollars out of a massive corporation. (This is, in fact, disputable. The showdown, which led Florida to strip Disney World of its independent status, may force nearby county governments to pay for services once covered by Disney.)\n\nWhile Reagan was a mythical figure, a movie star who trafficked in big, sweeping ideas, who liked to tell big, Hollywood-esque stories about himself and America, DeSantis is none of that. When you talk to people who like DeSantis, they use words like \"effective\" and \"chief executive\"-boring words, words that feel, in this moment of great national stasis, kind of reassuring.\n\n\"He's the good parts of Trump without that cockiness,\" says Andres Arcila, who was born in Colombia but has been here for the past three decades. For the last 26 years, Arcilla has run a pawn shop called Daddy's Cash, in hip, colorful Wynwood. \"He defends his priorities,\" Arcila continues. \"It may not be the ones that some people like, but he has those priorities.\"\n\nThat's more or less how Felipe Valera sees it.\n\nThe 54-year-old perfume peddler spends all day trudging around Little Havana with his cart full of bottles of J.Lo perfume and Versace, and he's basically a one-issue voter by now. His issue is inflation, which makes sense: No one struggling to fill up their tank or buy groceries or make rent buys J.Lo Perfume. He used to identify as a Democrat, and then the price of pretty much everything skyrocketed. (Valera starts every sentence with, \"You know how much a Coca Cola cost in the 1960s?\")\n\nHe calls the politicians, all of them, Democrats, Republicans, \"blah blah blah's,\" and he calls DeSantis \"a businessman\"-he's actually never been in business, but no matter-and \"the opposite of a blah blah blah,\" meaning, an operator.\n\nThe thing about DeSantis the Operator is his voters don't feel judged. No one feels like he's wagging his finger at them, telling them to mask up, or stay six feet away, or pray, or eat vegan, or be inclusive. (Even his much talked about scolding of the college kids wearing masks, in which he said it was time to dispense with the \"Covid theater,\" wasn't exactly scolding as much as it was scolding the scolders and the people who took the scolders seriously.) He's too busy pushing back against the school lockdowns or shipping illegal migrants to Martha's Vineyard-a move that horrified liberal elites but that many of his Latino supporters supported because they're tired of the preening, the signaling.\n\n\"I was a Democrat when I first came here,\" Claudia Cruz tells me. It's just after sunset on South Beach, and Cruz is smoking a cigarette-there's a pink bow in her hair, and we're surrounded by women scurrying in heels to get to their dinner reservations. \"I'm an immigrant, and they're the ones who want us here,\" she adds, referring to her thinking back then. In November, she voted for DeSantis. She says the Democrats are right about the environment, and she's not really a Republican. More libertarian; whichever party keeps the government small.\n\n\"You have to have a big tent that's actually diverse, and you don't do that by calling people with different viewpoints evil,\" Daren Dillinger, 54, an IT specialist from Jacksonville, tells me.\n\nDillinger misses Democratic Senator Russ Feingold-the only senator who, in the aftermath of 9/11, mustered the cojones to vote against the inaptly named Patriot Act-and he recalls, with great longing, Barack Obama campaigning to end the Iraq War, and Howard Dean, in 2004, saying gun regulation should be left to the states. He's nostalgic for the days when you could disagree with your party on an issue or two and still call it home.\n\nHe's gotten three doses of the Covid vaccine, and he's all for transgender rights, but he's tired of other progressives looking for all the ways he's not perfect, the wrong words that slip out of his mouth, the incorrect opinions he's voiced. That's why he formed a Facebook group for other disaffected Democrats. Which makes him sad. He feels like he used to belong to something, and he's definitely not a Republican, at least not yet. He's just in between.\n\nCarolina Castillo used to be what you'd call a progressive activist. She volunteered for groups like Florida Rising, which advocates for zero waste and believes for-profit housing-i.e., most housing-is \" a human rights violation .\" She was 1,000-percent for the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I was their biggest advocate,\" she says.\n\nShe's not sad like Dillinger. She's angry. It started when people at Florida Rising told her to check her privilege, because she looks white. (Her mom, she said, is Colombian and \"Indian looking\"; her father was from Spain.) Her parents were waiters. \"I thought, 'Wait a minute, I'm Latina-what are you talking about?'\"\n\nThen there was the Biden administration cozying up to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom Castillo detests, and the delisting of FARC as a foreign terrorist group. Did the White House really not know these were Marxist guerillas?\n\nIt pained her to say it, but you know what? Ron DeSantis knew exactly what FARC was all about. \"To elect a former narco-terrorist and a Marxist to lead Colombia is going to be disastrous, and so we stood with the people here in Florida that have ties to Colombia,\" DeSantis said in June. He was at a barbecue restaurant in Nassau County , reacting to the recent election in Colombia. It was like music to Colombians across Florida who thought the world had gone mad.\n\nThe Colombia stuff, she says, \"started opening my mind.\" We're eating plantain chips at a restaurant called Little Havana that's not actually in Little Havana-chickens in the yard, with a hole in the wall (literally). She's brought her middle-school daughter with her. \"I was just like, 'No, I am aligned with Ron DeSantis. I'm aligned with him against these socialist dictators. I'm aligned with him with Covid.\"\n\nDemocrats who know Castillo, including Evelyn Pérez-Verdia, a local Democratic consultant, think it's a pose. A way to get followers. It's true-ever since Castillo started tweeting about this stuff, her audience has grown. But Castillo denies there's anything inauthentic about her new politics. \"Those people don't know me,\" she says. \"Anyone who knows me knows this is real for me.\"\n\nThere's something telling about the way that Democrats like Pérez-Verdia-who calls Castillo \"a GOP plant\"-have reacted to her defection. They can't fathom a universe in which Democrats feel so put off that they vote Republican. \"Anyone with principles-you don't go to the Republican Party right now in the form that it is,\" Pérez-Verdia tells me. \"You don't.\"\n\nWhen I ask Democrats why Ron DeSantis won big in 2022, they insist it was all a matter of tactic or turnout. It had nothing to do with DeSantis the man, or the Democratic agenda, or the people and values behind that agenda.\n\n\"The base just did not come out,\" says one-term Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who represented the district stretching from southwest Miami all the way down to the Keys until 2020, when she lost to her Republican rival by three points.\n\nIn 2022, Christine Alexandria Olivo, a teacher, tried to retake the district for the Democrats. This time, they lost by more than 40 points. When I ask what happened-how she explains not winning thousands of voters who voted Democratic two years ago-she says simply, \"Democrats did not come out to vote.\"\n\nThat is true. Just like it's true that Florida Republicans spent nearly $90 million in 2019 and 2020 on a voter-registration drive, flipping the Democrats' 257,000-voter edge to a Republican advantage of nearly 300,000.\n\nBut that doesn't just happen in a vacuum. The plates have been shifting, and the things people care about, the things they expect from their government, are not what they were in 2020 or 2016. The Democrats, Dave Kerner says, are \"just not willing to be honest with themselves when they blame it all on the turnout or the fundraising gap.\"\n\nEven Pérez-Verdia acknowledges other Democrats aren't seeing what's happening to their base. \"There's a lot of denial, and they act like it's only MAGA people,\" she tells me. \"There are a lot of people who feel like this.\"\n\nCastillo, the former Democratic activist, tells me she's thinking of running herself, which makes sense. There's no evidence she's a fake, as some of her former progressive allies insist-she shows me her 2020 Miami-Dade Voter Information Card, which indicates she was a Democrat; and her Voter Information Card from this year, which shows that, as of June 16, she's a registered Republican.\n\nBut her story sounds a little pat, as if it were crafted with an audience in mind. Her Twitter bio proclaims that she's an anti-communist and that she's been a Republican-at least in spirit if not according to the powers that be in Miami-Dade-since #20deMayo2022. \"I remember thinking and crying, 'Oh my God, the irony that today is Cuban Independence Day, and they're still under a communist regime, and Biden didn't do shit,'\" Castillo tells me. \"I thought, 'No, I'm done.'\"\n\nShe's taken to retweeting the likes of pro-Trump activist Charlie Kirk and Newsmax host Benny Johnson (who lives in Tampa and tells me his neighbors are all DeSantis Democrats).\n\nAll of which is to say Castillo is a political entrepreneur, an opportunist, and she's tapping into an opportunity the Florida governor created for her and every other would-be politician testing the waters in anticipation of 2024.\n\nOlivia Reingold's last piece for us was about attacks on pro-life activists. Read it here .\n\nAnd support our reporting by becoming a subscriber today:\n\nUnlike progressive Democrats, DeSantis actually governs. That is what a governor is supposed to do, not tell people which bathrooms to use or what kind of stove to cook with. Governing means picking up the garbage, enforcing laws, cleaning up and rebuilding infrastructure after hurricanes. Governing is encouraging businesses to locate in your state,  not driving them out. There is no mystery about DeSantis's popularity\n\nThe point of starting this piece off in a gentleman's club was exactly what?\n\nNo posts"

Inside, some drag queens were hosting a \"hot body\" contest; the title went to a roided-out white guy, or so I heard. The room was so crowded, I fled outside. There, I heard a lot of gossip about one acquaintance getting strung along by another-plus a variety of opinions on the latest episode of RuPaul's Drag Race . Over cheap drinks and endless cigarettes, a million gay proclamations were made over a million gay subjects, but never once was the name Ron DeSantis uttered. As the night marched on and the crowd marched out, Grindr notifications chirped alongside the crickets underneath the patio. It was Friday night at a Florida gay bar and the only thing people were afraid of was going home alone.\n\nThis is what gay life in Florida is actually like.

      "text": "A version of this story originally appeared in Pirate Wires .\n\nOn March 6, the Florida House of Representatives passed legislation prohibiting the manufacture and sale of cultivated, or \"lab-grown,\" meat in Florida. Governor DeSantis is expected to sign the bill, and when he does, Florida will become the first state to ban cultivated meat, which is made by replicating the cells of real meat without the need to actually raise and slaughter the animal.\n\nOther states, including Arizona, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Alabama are considering similar bans. But what is the fight over cultivated meat really about? Is it economics, with one industry lobbying for protection from another? Is it the culture war, pitting red-blooded, carnivorous Americans against effete cosmopolitan environmentalists? Or is this truly a question of safety, as the state government, apparently in conflict with the FDA, has argued?\n\n\"The beef industry, specifically the Cattlemen's Association, is behind this,\" said Josh March, referring to the push to ban cultivated meat in Florida. March is the CEO of SciFi Foods , a start-up that produces cultivated beef. \"It's straight-up protectionism.\"\n\nIt's no secret that the Florida Cattlemen's Association (FCA) has lobbied to ban cultivated meat in Florida, or that it has some influence in the state. Through its fittingly named \"Florida Cow PAC,\" the FCA gave $10K to another PAC in 2021 to conduct a fundraiser for the president of the Florida Senate. Since 2017, it has contributed $75,000 to Ron DeSantis, more than any other candidate, and has spent $72,000 on the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee during the same period. It has also maxed out campaign donations to Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and several state legislators who were instrumental in pushing the cultivated meat ban, including Danny Alvarez, Clay Yarborough, and Tyler Sirois.\n\nStill, the maximum contributions are fairly low in Florida, at $3,000 for a statewide office and just $1,000 for legislative seats. Is this really enough to buy a party?\n\nSupporters of the bill say protectionism has nothing to do with it. \"Protecting them from what? A product that doesn't exist yet?\" said Florida State Representative Dean Black, a Republican from Jacksonville and supporter of the ban. When I asked why he thought the FCA had lobbied for the ban, he said, \"They believe they have a product that is safe,\" and noted that he was a fifth-generation Florida cattle rancher himself.\n\nJosh March also comes from a farming family-his father owns a small herd of cattle in Scotland-and says that small-hold ranchers like his father don't have much to fear from cultivated meat, at least for the foreseeable future. \"Cultivated meat is still very early on in its development, and it will take many years to scale up production.\" He pointed out that demand for meat was increasing all over the world, even as supply decreased in certain places-specifically, the American Midwest, where a drought last year wreaked havoc on the local beef industry. Companies like his, March argued, function to augment, rather than replace, the beef industry.\n\nBut given the U.S. national cattle herd has dwindled to its lowest point since 1951-something that happened without any cultivated beef products on the shelves-it seems the Cattlemen's Association has bigger, more immediate problems than Midwestern droughts and as-yet largely hypothetical lab grown beef alternatives. Among them: a spike in production costs and increased global competition. Still, it's not hard to imagine the Association might find the thought of further competition threatening, and why they'd rather argue on account of safety.\n\n\"We just want to make sure that a product is safe,\" Rep. Black insisted when I spoke with him. \"We shouldn't be in a rush to fundamentally alter the human diet without first knowing the ramifications of it.\" He added that when it comes to the \"ongoing\" field of human nutrition, \"we are still discovering things\" and as far as cultivated meat goes, \"there is no need to rush this to market.\"\n\nI pointed out that the FDA has already approved two different cultivated meat products, and asked who, if not the FDA, should determine whether or not cultivated meat products were safe. I didn't get a clear answer.\n\n\"We are in uncharted territory,\" Black said. \"We're taking natural food that humans evolved to eat and we're trying to manufacture it ourselves from chemicals. We don't know what's gonna get left out. This is uncharted territory. Our institutions are not ready for this.\"\n\nBlack pointed out that the \"FDA has made mistakes before.\"\n\nThe question of whether or not our regulatory institutions are \"ready\" for cultivated meat is an interesting one. There's no federal law or final regulation that specifically addresses cultivated meat, and the current regulatory process itself is operating in a novel, ad hoc fashion. For example, the regulation of beef and chicken (the two proteins the cultivated meat industry is most interested in) is normally carried out solely under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, cultivated meat is currently being regulated primarily by the FDA , with the USDA coming in only at the harvesting process to ensure proper labeling and sanitation requirements are met.\n\nMarch, whose company is currently working its way through FDA approval, will have to wait until they've done a full review of the cell lines and any chemicals used throughout SciFi food's process before they'll issue a letter of approval, at which point the USDA can begin its process.\n\nBut with no legislation or concrete federal regulation governing cultivated meat, it's unclear on what basis the FDA is making its decision. March told me that the two previous approvals, for Good Meat and Upside Foods , serve as something of a road map, but that the FDA has noted that the previous cases are not meant to serve as final guidance.\n\n\"As they learn more and get more information, they change their mind. So it can be a bit of a moving target,\" March said. \"The FDA is definitely cautious and conservative in their approach.\"\n\nThe idea of food regulation standards being a \"moving target\" isn't exactly reassuring, but setting regulations in stone for a nascent technology also seems unwise. One could take the FDA's \"moving target\" as evidence that \"our institutions are not prepared\" for cultivated meat, as Rep. Black thinks, or evidence that our institutions are evolving along with it. So either the FDA is doing exactly what Florida legislators want it to do, or it's not prepared to do anything at all, depending on your stance on cultivated meat.\n\nInstead of deciding which it is, the Florida legislature rendered the question moot. But the heart of the (purported) issue is less about regulatory processes than the immortalized cells used to create the product.\n\n\"Until we have long-term studies that tell me what lab-grown immortalized cells do to your body, I challenge you to put it in your child,\" said Florida State Representative Danny Alvarez, a co-sponsor of the bill banning cultivated meat.\n\nMarch assured me that the immortalized animal cells used in meat cultivation \"are very picky,\" and that getting them to grow in a bioreactor under very precise conditions is a struggle. More to the point, whenever the cells are removed from the bioreactor, they die, and will not grow no matter how immortal they are. \"Once they are cooked and dissolved by your stomach, they are just a collection of amino acids and DNA, same as if you ate any other cell.\"\n\nThe safety of immortal cells in cultivated meat is what Bloomberg , in its reporting, called an \"informal scientific consensus.\" But as proponents of the Florida ban pointed out, there are no long-term studies.\n\nWith every company's immortal cell line unique, lab-made, and patented, cultivated meat struck me as somewhat akin to GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, which have infiltrated the American diet from produce to cattle feed. But despite similarities, their political reception has been quite different.\n\nFor most of my life, opposition to GMOs has been a liberal issue, while the opposition to cultivated meat-at least in Florida-is being led by Republicans. In part, this might be a sign of the times; health-nuttery is more right-coded than it used to be, particularly online, and particularly after Covid, as is distrust of the FDA. But never mind all that. When it comes to the culture wars, cultivated meat's biggest problem is that it assuages liberal neuroses in ways that annoy conservatives at best and make them paranoid at worst.\n\nLiberals in The Washington Post openly yearning for a \" guilt-free meat \" future are suggesting, not so subtly, that eating meat in the present is immoral. From there, people imagine that sanctimonious liberal elites might one day force them to eat the \"guilt-free meat\"- in the pod, with a side of bugs . In this fever dream, slaughterhouses are shut down and turned into bike lanes for illegal-immigrant drag queens commuting to work at children's libraries filled with neo-Marxist gay pornography. But it starts with your dinner.\n\nJosh March admitted that vegan sanctimony had been unhelpful to the industry.\n\n\"The plant-based meat industry didn't do itself, or the cultivated meat industry, any favors by being so aggressively anti-meat,\" March told me. \"There's a lot of middle Americans, and Americans in general, who don't want to be told by vegans in California to stop eating meat.\n\n\"Ultimately, I think a lot of that anti-meat rhetoric that came with the first wave of meat alternatives has kind of backfired and made meat and alternatives part of the culture war.\"\n\nBut perhaps even more contentious than cultivated meat's \"anti-meat\" reputation, deserved or not, is its place in the fight over climate change. Whether or not cultivated meat is less carbon-intensive than traditional meat is contingent on several factors, such as the type of energy being used to power the facility and the type of meat being replaced. One study even suggested that cultivated meat might be 25 times worse for the climate. (Companies like SciFi Foods claim that their products are more sustainable than traditionally cultivated meat using studies they've personally commissioned.) Governor DeSantis seemed to channel this line of thinking, that agriculture is unfairly being demonized-see the endless war on cow flatulence -while throwing his support behind the cultivated meat ban.\n\n\"They really want to go after agriculture,\" he said during a recent speech attacking ESG governance , a set of standards companies can adhere to if they wish to market themselves to socially conscious investors. \"They want to blame agriculture for global warming.\"\n\nEveryone knows that ESG is a moral laundering scheme for socially liberal neurotics with too much money (Marathon Petroleum is an \"ESG\" company), but the fact is that's more of a goofy marketing racket rather than a burger-snatching New World Order. But that doesn't matter-perception does, and the perception is that cultivated meat is part of an effort to replace traditional meat with Frankenfood at the behest of godless, sanctimonious elites who obsess over climate change because they, unlike regular Americans, don't have any real problems. I think that this was the real driving force behind Florida's meat ban, with the health concerns serving as a good talking point, and the beef lobby's political patronage merely serving as the icing on a cake everyone already wanted to bake.\n\nMarch told me he thought the FDA was the best arbiter of safety and that consumers should be the ones to ultimately decide whether or not they want to eat cultivated meat-not their state government. It's a clear answer, which is more than I received from proponents of the Florida ban.\n\nLawmakers opposed to cultivated meat can't seem to decide who should make the call on safety, when there might be \"enough\" research, or why, given the wide array of \"unnatural\" food products lining Publix shelves today, individual Floridians shouldn't be able to decide for themselves whether they want to eat the product. As a Floridian who wrote this article with a cigarette in his mouth, I don't want my state government prohibiting products where the detrimental health effects are certain, much less theoretical.\n\nRiver Page is a staff writer at Pirate Wires.

      "text": "On Wednesday night, Fox News and the streaming platform Rumble hosted the first Republican presidential debate with the eight GOP hopefuls who made the cut: North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, former governor of Arkansas Asa Hutchinson, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former vice president Mike Pence, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nMissing from the stage was Donald Trump, who refused to attend the debate. Instead, he sat down with Tucker Carlson-a move that allowed him to flip the bird to the RNC and allowed Tucker to do the same to Fox, who fired him a few months ago. Trump's interview with Tucker aired exclusively on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and more than 74 million people tuned in.\n\nHere at The Free Press , we love a good debate night, and we were up until the wee hours discussing it all. So today on Honestly , TFP reporter Olivia Reingold, TFP senior editor Peter Savodnik, and Newsweek 's opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon are here to discuss: who emerged on top? Who fell by the wayside? And did the elephant not in the room still somehow manage to dominate the night?\n\nAnd the winner is. . .\n\nBari : With Trump missing from the debate stage, there was only really one reason to tune in, and that was to see if there's actually a viable candidate in this race that is not Trump. Polling has consistently shown that people are desperate for an alternative to another Trump v. Biden face-off in 2024. And I wonder, did last night give us a clear contender?\n\nBatya : The two competing answers we got at our debate at Newsweek were that the winner of the GOP debate was Donald Trump, and the other one was the winner was Joe Biden. So clearly, we felt that no one really stood out. There were some moments that really defined the evening. One of them was the foreign policy debate between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, which was sort of the old GOP versus the new Trump GOP going at it. At that moment, Vivek's credibility really came into question in a way that surprised me. I did find myself admiring the way in which Nikki took the event to task, despite the fact that I agreed with what Vivek was saying. Vivek had the right lines, but Haley's deportment and her credibility and her experience, despite the fact I don't agree with what she's done with it, really came through for me.\n\nPeter : I think it's obvious that Vivek had the best night. He had the best lines. He had the most energy and the most momentum. The problem is that he's trying to beat Trump. Ultimately, the question for him, which no one asked, is if you are such a fervent supporter of Trump, why are you running? I think he did great last night, but I don't see how that actually wins him the nomination.\n\nOlivia : I think this was the first time that a lot of people really heard of this guy [Vivek] or started taking him seriously. I think his ascent can be explained by his authenticity or perceived authenticity. It's very hard to be authentic on a debate stage. You saw a lot of other candidates using pretty canned or rehearsed lines, but I got the sense that often Vivek was improvising and he sometimes took positions that the crowd was not happy with, but he still maintained his position. I think that's what people admire about him: they feel like they're getting someone who's actually honest about where he stands. He's not trying to water things down.\n\nBari : And how are voters responding to him?\n\nOlivia : What I heard from a lot of voters is that they see Trump as someone who talks about everything that's wrong about America, but what they see in Vivek is someone who says what could be right about America. However, I do think Vivek's optimism was tarnished a bit by some of his pretty ugly and aggressive hits on the debate stage.\n\nNikki Haley stands her ground:\n\nBari : I think Nikki Haley also emerged as a clear contender. From the very start of the night, she came out swinging. She started by attacking her own party for blowing up the debt. Here's what she said: \"The fact is that no one is telling the American people the truth. The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us. Our Republicans did this to us, too. Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our debt. Our kids are never going to forgive us for this. Look at the 2024 budget: Republicans asked for $7.4 billion in earmarks. Democrats asked for $2.8 billion. So you tell me, who are the big spenders? I think it's time for an accountant in the White House.\" Batya, what did you think of her strategy?\n\nBatya : It was a way of talking about the economy that set her apart, right? It was a gambit to be like, \"Let's all take responsibility. Both sides are at fault for inflation.\" I think she really is a throwback to the pre-Trump Republican Party not just on foreign policy but on economic policy as well. I think that Nikki Haley also showed the Republican Party the way forward on abortion, which is a very tricky issue. Haley said: \"Let's find consensus. Can't we all agree that we should ban late-term abortions? Can't we all agree that we should encourage adoptions? Can't we all agree that doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortion shouldn't have to perform them? Can't we all agree that contraception should be available? And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?\" Now, that was a very courageous thing for a pro-life candidate to say, but finding that consensus is the only way to get out of this morass. I don't know how it felt in the room, but at least watching from home, it seemed like that really landed with the audience. I know just from the working-class people I spoke to, they really do agree.\n\nBari : Nikki also clearly came ready to deploy this one particular line by Margaret Thatcher. While Vivek and Christie were sort of squabbling back and forth, she decides to step in and says: \"If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,\" and the crowd cheered. Is the GOP embracing the #TheFutureIsFemale and #GirlBoss?\n\nPeter : Last night, Haley showed herself as someone who is about getting things done. When Haley confronted Pence about the Senate calculus, that was her confronting him about playing from an old playbook. That was her calling him out for being stuck in the '80s. And that's why the Thatcher quote worked so well. It's her saying, \"We're all more or less in agreement here that abortion is lamentable, but what can we actually get done?\" If you look at what happened in Kansas, if you look at the debates going on in her own state or in other red bastions, you can see that people are tired of the old original culture war that stretches back to the early '70s. So I think she very deftly tapped into that, just like with the line attacking the GOP over the debt in the very beginning. It was her way of attacking the swamp without identifying it as the swamp. I thought she was just very smart in an almost coded way.\n\nBari : I think that the phrase has become overused, but it felt like she was putting herself forward as the \"commonsensical candidate.\"\n\nPeter : Yeah, that's right.\n\nThe elephant not in the room:\n\nBari : At about the hour mark of the debate, Brett Baier said he wanted to take a moment to address the elephant not in the room. And of course, that was Donald Trump. The candidates proceeded to spend 15 minutes going back and forth about the former president. Chris Christie got an audience full of boos after saying that we need to stop normalizing this type of conduct. Vivek contested Christie by declaring that Trump is the greatest president of the twenty-first century. Looking at where the Republican voter base currently is, which of these two have the correct strategy?\n\nPeter : If Trump's the greatest president of the twenty-first century, then why would we vote for anyone besides him? Again, Haley was the only one who actually got it right when she said no one wants a rematch between Biden and Trump next year. A large majority of Americans do not want a rematch of 2020. I also think Chris Christie made a very compelling argument. He was saying something that would travel very well in a general election, but it's going to sink his campaign now. He's targeted all these MAGA voters whom he needs if he wants to win the nomination. So politically, he's unviable. However, Haley, in a smart, deft way, was able to tap into what people are thinking and feeling.\n\nBatya : I thought it was great TV. I thought they had to ask that question, but I think the answer-it's sort of unanswerable because Trump's accomplishments were so vast on behalf of the working class. To ask people to not vote for a man who immeasurably improved their lives, who made this country feel like it cared about them for the first time in generations, who put money in their bank accounts, and for the first time made the American dream feel like something they could start dreaming about again-to ask them not to vote for him is not just ridiculous. None of those people onstage are able to quite understand the complexity. These people are not voting for Trump because they think he's moral. They're voting for him because it is undeniable what he accomplished and because he represented their future.\n\nPence invokes Jesus; DeSantis flounders:\n\nBari : Talking about Trump gave Pence his big opportunity to get on the soapbox, and Christie and Scott and Haley all applauded him for his refusal to buckle under the pressure of Trump on January 6. And Pence leaned hard into this moment. He said he took an oath to the Constitution and his Heavenly Father and said, \"Everyone on this stage needs to make it clear whether they'll do the same.\" Now, taking a step back-this is the riddle of Mike Pence. You look at him: he was the governor of Indiana. He was vice president of the United States. He's very hardcore on every conservative issue. And yet he's polling at like four percent. So, is the problem that Mike Pence is just so uncharismatic, or is there something about his brand of conservatism that's just not relevant anymore?\n\nBatya : The GOP base is the working class, and the working class is not hardcore. They are extremely tolerant. They're conservative by and large on social issues, much more so than Democrats, but they are deeply, deeply tolerant people. And the class issue unites them much more than a political identity. And, you know, this is something that I think is very hard for people to understand: working-class conservatives hate the Republican Party. They hate, hate, hate the Republican Party. And Mike Pence really represents that thing that they hate. And so I don't think it's surprising at all. I do think what's interesting is that we've gotten 45 minutes in and have not even mentioned Ron DeSantis-\n\nBari : Yes, let's get to DeSantis! The biggest loser to me on that stage was Ron DeSantis. Six months ago, we were told by everyone that the Florida governor was the man to beat. He was hailed as the future of the Republican Party. He raised $20 million in the first six weeks of his campaign. He was definitely the favorite among the donor class who were looking for an alternative to Trump. He was the strong horse. Now, last night he tried to Trumpify himself a few times. He said things like, \"Anthony [Fauci], you're fired.\" He blamed the corporate media for the decline of America. He called out George Soros and liberal DAs, saying the inmates are running our asylums. I'm sure he rehearsed all of those lines, but none of them stuck. I'm not going to remember any of them 24 hours from now. A lot of people are saying it's lights out for Ron DeSantis. He's done. What do you think? What happened to Ronnie D? And any chance of him making a comeback?\n\nPeter : I don't think so, because, look, the whole DeSantis play from the very beginning has been one word, which is competence . The whole campaign is premised on the assumption that the Republican base cares deeply about the Trump agenda. And I think that's wrong. I think what they really care about is they want the proverbial bull in a china shop. They want the person who's going to muck everything up. That's what they love about Vivek. That's what they responded to last night. I think that's why Nikki Haley's line about a woman getting the job done resonated so well with voters. It's argumentative, it's brash, and DeSantis lacks all of that.\n\nBatya : I disagree with Peter. I think that Ron DeSantis misunderstood the Trump voter in exactly the same way that the liberal media does. He assumed, like the liberal media does, that people voted for Trump because they were anti-gay or suspicious of black people. The truth is the exact opposite: the Trump voter is very pro-gay, like Trump. They're also not suspicious of black people. There's a lot of unity around that. They're very eager to show that they are tolerant and have moved on from that stereotype about Republicans. So to me, the thing that draws Trump's voters is the economic policy that's geared towards the working class. The reason Ron DeSantis will not be able to recover is because he doesn't agree with Trump about creating an economy that does that. There is a huge divide in the GOP between what the donor class wants, which is the fight against wokeness, and what the voter base wants, which is an economy that works for the hardest-working Americans.\n\nTrump's very. . . Trumpy. . . interview on Tucker:\n\nBari : In my opinion, Tucker's interview with Trump didn't feel like a presidential conversation. They were chatting about things like Jeffrey Epstein, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris, but Trump barely dinged DeSantis. He didn't mention Vivek. Do you think this is a winning strategy? Can he just sail his way to the nomination and not engage with these debates at all?\n\nOlivia : I think not. In retrospect, I don't think it was advantageous for him to not attend last night's debate because without him being there, they didn't have to differentiate themselves from him. I think if he were in the room, it would have been really uncomfortable for them to challenge or contradict him. The interview with Tucker surprised me because it had the cadence of someone who is not really in campaign mode.\n\nBari : I think because he is so far ahead in the polls, he just feels he's above the other candidates. Trump is ignoring standard etiquette and standard politics, but again, maybe that's just a smart strategy. Peter, what do you think?\n\nPeter : I think that's obviously the strategy sitting on a 55 percent lead. That's the piece of the GOP base that he controls, or at least is in his camp right now. However, I don't see that working long-term or over the next five, six months in the lead-up to the first primary in South Carolina. What Trump seems to be forgetting is his own lesson of 2016, which is you have to fight for the nomination. While all the other candidates back in 2015 were kind of riding on years of experience, political careers, and their various successes or elections, Trump was actually making a case in his own kind of blustering, bombastic way for a totally different politics. And it was a fight. It really resonates with voters. I think what happens is that people will begin to look at the candidates like Vivek and think maybe he is a better alternative. The question is, can someone who's more reasonable or with a broader and more ecumenical appeal like a Haley become viable?\n\nBari : I hate myself for feeling this way, but as I was watching the Trump-Tucker interview, I felt that it was more objectively entertaining than what was happening on the debate stage in Milwaukee. Others would disagree. Do people still have the appetite for what Trump is offering?\n\nBatya : I think Trump was probably hoping it would dominate the headlines. Yet the headlines really were very much about the debate. Also, Trump is very rarely wrong about where the populist energy is flowing, so him praising Vivek on Truth Social this morning signals to me that he really does not see him as a threat at all. Maybe they've spoken about VP or something, but if he was worried about him after last night, I don't think he would have been saying nice things about him on Truth Social. There were a few moments during the Tucker interview where we really saw a different side of Trump that I think doesn't come out a lot because he's often in fight mode. At one point, Trump said, \"You have great people in the Democratic Party. You have great people that are Democrats. Most of the people in our country are fantastic. I'm representing everybody, not just Republicans or conservatives. I'm the president of everybody.\" And to me, that was the Trump that we could have had if the other side did not declare war on him from the minute he got into office and just decided he was an illegitimate president, despite the fact that he won that first election in 2016 fairly. So I think there was a little bit of pathos for me watching it in that sense.\n\nBari : Let's assume it's Trump v. Biden in 2024. Who's your money on?\n\nOlivia : I think it's going to be Trump simply because that really makes it a referendum on Biden. I just don't think people are pleased enough with his performance to reelect him.\n\nPeter : It's Trump because Covid is over. That was what undid him in 2020.\n\nBatya : I don't like to prognosticate because I am always wrong, but I have to say I really, really don't know. I am excited to find out. I thought the debate last night was really interesting, and I think this is just a really interesting election cycle in terms of thinking about the future of our nation and in terms of how we see ourselves as Americans and what our priorities are. So I'm looking forward to it, whichever way it turns out.\n\nAt The Free Press, we believe in having hard conversations out loud.

Ultimately, the question for him, which no one asked, is if you are such a fervent supporter of Trump, why are you running? I think he did great last night, but I don't see how that actually wins him the nomination.\n\nOlivia : I think this was the first time that a lot of people really heard of this guy [Vivek] or started taking him seriously. I think his ascent can be explained by his authenticity or perceived authenticity. It's very hard to be authentic on a debate stage. You saw a lot of other candidates using pretty canned or rehearsed lines, but I got the sense that often Vivek was improvising and he sometimes took positions that the crowd was not happy with, but he still maintained his position. I think that's what people admire about him: they feel like they're getting someone who's actually honest about where he stands. He's not trying to water things down.\n\nBari : And how are voters responding to him?\n\nOlivia : What I heard from a lot of voters is that they see Trump as someone who talks about everything that's wrong about America, but what they see in Vivek is someone who says what could be right about America. However, I do think Vivek's optimism was tarnished a bit by some of his pretty ugly and aggressive hits on the debate stage.\n\nNikki Haley stands her ground:\n\nBari : I think Nikki Haley also emerged as a clear contender. From the very start of the night, she came out swinging. She started by attacking her own party for blowing up the debt. Here's what she said: \"The fact is that no one is telling the American people the truth. The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us. Our Republicans did this to us, too. Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our debt. Our kids are never going to forgive us for this. Look at the 2024 budget: Republicans asked for $7.4 billion in earmarks. Democrats asked for $2.8 billion. So you tell me, who are the big spenders? I think it's time for an accountant in the White House.\" Batya, what did you think of her strategy?\n\nBatya : It was a way of talking about the economy that set her apart, right? It was a gambit to be like, \"Let's all take responsibility. Both sides are at fault for inflation.\" I think she really is a throwback to the pre-Trump Republican Party not just on foreign policy but on economic policy as well. I think that Nikki Haley also showed the Republican Party the way forward on abortion, which is a very tricky issue. Haley said: \"Let's find consensus. Can't we all agree that we should ban late-term abortions? Can't we all agree that we should encourage adoptions? Can't we all agree that doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortion shouldn't have to perform them? Can't we all agree that contraception should be available? And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?\" Now, that was a very courageous thing for a pro-life candidate to say, but finding that consensus is the only way to get out of this morass. I don't know how it felt in the room, but at least watching from home, it seemed like that really landed with the audience. I know just from the working-class people I spoke to, they really do agree.\n\nBari : Nikki also clearly came ready to deploy this one particular line by Margaret Thatcher. While Vivek and Christie were sort of squabbling back and forth, she decides to step in and says: \"If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,\" and the crowd cheered. Is the GOP embracing the #TheFutureIsFemale and #GirlBoss?\n\nPeter : Last night, Haley showed herself as someone who is about getting things done. When Haley confronted Pence about the Senate calculus, that was her confronting him about playing from an old playbook. That was her calling him out for being stuck in the '80s. And that's why the Thatcher quote worked so well. It's her saying, \"We're all more or less in agreement here that abortion is lamentable, but what can we actually get done?\" If you look at what happened in Kansas, if you look at the debates going on in her own state or in other red bastions, you can see that people are tired of the old original culture war that stretches back to the early '70s. So I think she very deftly tapped into that, just like with the line attacking the GOP over the debt in the very beginning. It was her way of attacking the swamp without identifying it as the swamp. I thought she was just very smart in an almost coded way.\n\nBari : I think that the phrase has become overused, but it felt like she was putting herself forward as the \"commonsensical candidate.\"\n\nPeter : Yeah, that's right.\n\nThe elephant not in the room:\n\nBari : At about the hour mark of the debate, Brett Baier said he wanted to take a moment to address the elephant not in the room. And of course, that was Donald Trump. The candidates proceeded to spend 15 minutes going back and forth about the former president. Chris Christie got an audience full of boos after saying that we need to stop normalizing this type of conduct. Vivek contested Christie by declaring that Trump is the greatest president of the twenty-first century. Looking at where the Republican voter base currently is, which of these two have the correct strategy?\n\nPeter : If Trump's the greatest president of the twenty-first century, then why would we vote for anyone besides him? Again, Haley was the only one who actually got it right when she said no one wants a rematch between Biden and Trump next year. A large majority of Americans do not want a rematch of 2020. I also think Chris Christie made a very compelling argument. He was saying something that would travel very well in a general election, but it's going to sink his campaign now. He's targeted all these MAGA voters whom he needs if he wants to win the nomination. So politically, he's unviable. However, Haley, in a smart, deft way, was able to tap into what people are thinking and feeling.\n\nBatya : I thought it was great TV. I thought they had to ask that question, but I think the answer-it's sort of unanswerable because Trump's accomplishments were so vast on behalf of the working class. To ask people to not vote for a man who immeasurably improved their lives, who made this country feel like it cared about them for the first time in generations, who put money in their bank accounts, and for the first time made the American dream feel like something they could start dreaming about again-to ask them not to vote for him is not just ridiculous. None of those people onstage are able to quite understand the complexity. These people are not voting for Trump because they think he's moral. They're voting for him because it is undeniable what he accomplished and because he represented their future.\n\nPence invokes Jesus; DeSantis flounders:\n\nBari : Talking about Trump gave Pence his big opportunity to get on the soapbox, and Christie and Scott and Haley all applauded him for his refusal to buckle under the pressure of Trump on January 6. And Pence leaned hard into this moment. He said he took an oath to the Constitution and his Heavenly Father and said, \"Everyone on this stage needs to make it clear whether they'll do the same.\" Now, taking a step back-this is the riddle of Mike Pence. You look at him: he was the governor of Indiana. He was vice president of the United States. He's very hardcore on every conservative issue. And yet he's polling at like four percent. So, is the problem that Mike Pence is just so uncharismatic, or is there something about his brand of conservatism that's just not relevant anymore?\n\nBatya : The GOP base is the working class, and the working class is not hardcore. They are extremely tolerant. They're conservative by and large on social issues, much more so than Democrats, but they are deeply, deeply tolerant people. And the class issue unites them much more than a political identity. And, you know, this is something that I think is very hard for people to understand: working-class conservatives hate the Republican Party. They hate, hate, hate the Republican Party. And Mike Pence really represents that thing that they hate. And so I don't think it's surprising at all. I do think what's interesting is that we've gotten 45 minutes in and have not even mentioned Ron DeSantis-\n\nBari : Yes, let's get to DeSantis! The biggest loser to me on that stage was Ron DeSantis. Six months ago, we were told by everyone that the Florida governor was the man to beat. He was hailed as the future of the Republican Party. He raised $20 million in the first six weeks of his campaign. He was definitely the favorite among the donor class who were looking for an alternative to Trump. He was the strong horse. Now, last night he tried to Trumpify himself a few times. He said things like, \"Anthony [Fauci], you're fired.\" He blamed the corporate media for the decline of America. He called out George Soros and liberal DAs, saying the inmates are running our asylums. I'm sure he rehearsed all of those lines, but none of them stuck. I'm not going to remember any of them 24 hours from now. A lot of people are saying it's lights out for Ron DeSantis. He's done. What do you think? What happened to Ronnie D? And any chance of him making a comeback?\n\nPeter : I don't think so, because, look, the whole DeSantis play from the very beginning has been one word, which is competence . The whole campaign is premised on the assumption that the Republican base cares deeply about the Trump agenda. And I think that's wrong. I think what they really care about is they want the proverbial bull in a china shop. They want the person who's going to muck everything up. That's what they love about Vivek. That's what they responded to last night. I think that's why Nikki Haley's line about a woman getting the job done resonated so well with voters. It's argumentative, it's brash, and DeSantis lacks all of that.\n\nBatya : I disagree with Peter. I think that Ron DeSantis misunderstood the Trump voter in exactly the same way that the liberal media does. He assumed, like the liberal media does, that people voted for Trump because they were anti-gay or suspicious of black people. The truth is the exact opposite: the Trump voter is very pro-gay, like Trump. They're also not suspicious of black people. There's a lot of unity around that. They're very eager to show that they are tolerant and have moved on from that stereotype about Republicans. So to me, the thing that draws Trump's voters is the economic policy that's geared towards the working class. The reason Ron DeSantis will not be able to recover is because he doesn't agree with Trump about creating an economy that does that. There is a huge divide in the GOP between what the donor class wants, which is the fight against wokeness, and what the voter base wants, which is an economy that works for the hardest-working Americans.\n\nTrump's very. . . Trumpy. . . interview on Tucker:\n\nBari : In my opinion, Tucker's interview with Trump didn't feel like a presidential conversation. They were chatting about things like Jeffrey Epstein, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris, but Trump barely dinged DeSantis. He didn't mention Vivek. Do you think this is a winning strategy? Can he just sail his way to the nomination and not engage with these debates at all?\n\nOlivia : I think not. In retrospect, I don't think it was advantageous for him to not attend last night's debate because without him being there, they didn't have to differentiate themselves from him. I think if he were in the room, it would have been really uncomfortable for them to challenge or contradict him. The interview with Tucker surprised me because it had the cadence of someone who is not really in campaign mode.\n\nBari : I think because he is so far ahead in the polls, he just feels he's above the other candidates. Trump is ignoring standard etiquette and standard politics, but again, maybe that's just a smart strategy. Peter, what do you think?\n\nPeter : I think that's obviously the strategy sitting on a 55 percent lead. That's the piece of the GOP base that he controls, or at least is in his camp right now. However, I don't see that working long-term or over the next five, six months in the lead-up to the first primary in South Carolina. What Trump seems to be forgetting is his own lesson of 2016, which is you have to fight for the nomination. While all the other candidates back in 2015 were kind of riding on years of experience, political careers, and their various successes or elections, Trump was actually making a case in his own kind of blustering, bombastic way for a totally different politics. And it was a fight. It really resonates with voters. I think what happens is that people will begin to look at the candidates like Vivek and think maybe he is a better alternative. The question is, can someone who's more reasonable or with a broader and more ecumenical appeal like a Haley become viable?\n\nBari : I hate myself for feeling this way, but as I was watching the Trump-Tucker interview, I felt that it was more objectively entertaining than what was happening on the debate stage in Milwaukee. Others would disagree. Do people still have the appetite for what Trump is offering?\n\nBatya : I think Trump was probably hoping it would dominate the headlines. Yet the headlines really were very much about the debate. Also, Trump is very rarely wrong about where the populist energy is flowing, so him praising Vivek on Truth Social this morning signals to me that he really does not see him as a threat at all. Maybe they've spoken about VP or something, but if he was worried about him after last night, I don't think he would have been saying nice things about him on Truth Social. There were a few moments during the Tucker interview where we really saw a different side of Trump that I think doesn't come out a lot because he's often in fight mode. At one point, Trump said, \"You have great people in the Democratic Party. You have great people that are Democrats. Most of the people in our country are fantastic. I'm representing everybody, not just Republicans or conservatives. I'm the president of everybody.\" And to me, that was the Trump that we could have had if the other side did not declare war on him from the minute he got into office and just decided he was an illegitimate president, despite the fact that he won that first election in 2016 fairly. So I think there was a little bit of pathos for me watching it in that sense.\n\nBari : Let's assume it's Trump v. Biden in 2024. Who's your money on?\n\nOlivia : I think it's going to be Trump simply because that really makes it a referendum on Biden. I just don't think people are pleased enough with his performance to reelect him.\n\nPeter : It's Trump because Covid is over. That was what undid him in 2020.\n\nBatya : I don't like to prognosticate because I am always wrong, but I have to say I really, really don't know. I am excited to find out. I thought the debate last night was really interesting, and I think this is just a really interesting election cycle in terms of thinking about the future of our nation and in terms of how we see ourselves as Americans and what our priorities are. So I'm looking forward to it, whichever way it turns out.\n\nAt The Free Press, we believe in having hard conversations out loud.

      "text": "In an exclusive interview with The American Conservative , Florida's Ron DeSantis explains his war with Disney for the soul and sovereignty of America.\n\n\"The question is,\" said Humpty Dumpty, \"which is to be master-that is all.\"\n\nFor the past fourteen months, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and the Walt Disney Company have been at war. I traveled down to Tallahassee, about 250 miles northwest of the Walt Disney World Resort, Disney's home base in the Sunshine State, to interview DeSantis about Florida's campaign against Mickey and the Magic Kingdom.\n\nIt started last March over a piece of legislation that prohibited teaching students below third grade about divergent sexual and gender identities-and the instruction that inevitably comes with these themes. The fighting intensified as the governor and Florida's elected representatives tried to find ways to rein in Disney's power. The fight has been particularly intense for the past ninety days or so, as the governor and legislators sprang their rat trap.\n\nIf DeSantis and his allies have their way, the war will end with the dismantling of Disney's numerous special privileges granted by the state, which the company has enjoyed for the last half-century, including the ability essentially to govern itself via the Reedy Creek Improvement District. DeSantis recently signed legislation doing precisely that. But first, Mickey wants his day in court. This is America, after all.\n\nThe episode has raised key questions about sovereignty, the proper relationship between corporations and the state, public and private power, and how conservatives should conceive of markets and our economic system. Like Lewis Carroll's egg-man, Disney, which did not respond to requests for comment, has enunciated from its perch the only important political question: Who is to be master-the people's duly elected representatives, or a private enterprise?\n\nThe Florida legislature passed H.B. 1557, the Parental Rights in Education Act, on March 8, 2022. The bill sought to \"prohibit[ ] classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity\" for students in kindergarten through third grade, provided parents with more transparency about any \"critical decisions affecting a student's mental, emotional, or physical well-being,\" and prevented schools from adopting policies that purposefully kept parents in the dark. The left nicknamed H.B. 1557 the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill.\n\nWhen the media initially started referring to H.B. 1557 as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, the governor had no idea what they were referring to. \"All of a sudden, I'm out doing just random press conferences, and I hear the media start repeating ['Don't Say Gay'],\" DeSantis told me with a chuckle.\n\nAfter years of clashes with the media over Covid-19 and critical race theory, the governor immediately knew what this was: \"B.S.\" For DeSantis, it was the perfect illustration of establishment mediocrity and laziness. \"It's an example of the left creating kind of a narrative and literally corporate press just echoing exactly what the left is saying,\" he said.\n\nH.B. 1557 was ill-received by the self-proclaimed happiest place on earth. As the bill was being considered, Disney employees organized to pressure management, specifically then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek, to condemn the legislation. Chapek and the company had been silent on the bill, while former (and now current) Disney CEO Bob Iger had come out against it on Twitter.\n\nThe week the legislation passed, Chapek sent an internal email to Disney employees seeking to signal the company's \"commitment to the LGBTQ+ community,\" despite its silence on H.B. 1557.\n\n\"In terms of our communities, we are and will continue to be a leader in supporting organizations that champion diversity. In 2021, we provided nearly $3 million to support the work of LGBTQ+ organizations. And, we have a long history of supporting important events like Pride parades,\" Chapek wrote.\n\n\"I do not want anyone to mistake a lack of statement [on H.B. 1557] for a lack of support,\" he continued. \"We all share the same goal of a more tolerant, respectful world. Where we may differ is in the tactics to get there.\"\n\nChapek's memo only added fuel to the fire. #BoycottDisney trended on Twitter.\n\nOn March 9, the day after the legislature voted to send H.B. 1557 to the governor's desk, Chapek faced some of his critics during a shareholder meeting. At the meeting, Chapek reportedly said off-camera that \"While we've been strong supporters of the community for decades, I know that many are upset that we did not speak out against the bill.\"\n\nNevertheless, Chapek affirmed that Disney was \"opposed to the bill from the outset, and we chose not to take a public position because we felt we could be more effective working behind the scenes directly with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nDeSantis, however, said that if Disney was actively lobbying against the bill in Tallahassee, he heard nothing about it. Per the governor, Disney has \"a fleet of lobbyists here,\" but \"they didn't say a word about it.\"\n\n\"Prior to April 2022, they had enough lobbying muscle with the legislature that they pretty much got everything they wanted,\" DeSantis said. \"I don't know that there's anything over many, many decades that they lost on.\"\n\nIn the past, Disney has been able to water down even important bipartisan pieces of legislation, according to the governor: \"They just accumulated a lot of political power.\" He pointed to previous legislation surrounding human trafficking, claiming that \"Disney lobbied against having their hotels play more of a role in putting out information\" about trafficking.\n\nFlorida's relationship with Disney and the tourism and entertainment industries more broadly is not unlike other states with large, powerful corporate interests focused on one industry-Silicon Valley and California, Wall Street and New York, credit-card companies and Delaware.\n\nBut the battle over H.B. 1557 wasn't about Disney's bottom line. It was a battle over the cultural direction of the state of Florida and beyond.\n\nDeSantis told me Chapek called him at one point to talk about H.B. 1557. \"The CEO did call me one day,\" DeSantis recounted. \"My sense was he didn't want to get involved in it, but he was getting a lot of pressure.\"\n\n\"I just told him it's a false narrative.\" DeSantis said he went through the legislation and plainly told Chapek, \"Look, I see no problem with this.\"\n\nThe outrage machine continued to churn at the mouse house. On March 11, Chapek apologized to all of Disney's 200,000 employees in a company-wide email-to no avail. The protests continued. In response, Disney said, \"We respect our colleagues' right to express their views, and we pledge our ongoing support of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community in the fight for equal rights.\"\n\nOn March 28, DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education Act into law. \"It was just an obvious piece of legislation,\" DeSantis said with a shrug.\n\n\"Parents' rights have been increasingly under assault around the nation, but in Florida we stand up for the rights of parents and the fundamental role they play in the education of their children,\" DeSantis said in a statement at the time. \"Parents have every right to be informed about services offered to their child at school, and should be protected from schools using classroom instruction to sexualize their kids as young as 5 years old.\"\n\nBut Disney caved to the pressure. \"Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,\" the company said in a statement after the law passed. \"We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.\" With that, the stage was set for a showdown between the governor and the corporate behemoth.\n\nWhen Walt Disney, with his brother Roy and Democratic Florida Gov. Haydon Burns, announced that his company was building an attraction in Florida on November 15, 1965, he said he wanted to build \"something that would command the respect of the community.\"\n\n\"The important thing,\" Walt continued, with the paternal charm that had earned him fans the world over, \"is the family...that's been the backbone of our whole business, catering to the families, and that's what we hope to do.\"\n\n\"Walt's vision is what they should subscribe to,\" DeSantis said after I read him the quote from Walt's 1965 press conference. Decades of slow institutional capture by progressives has caused Disney to err from Walt's pro-family patriotism.\n\nThe same can be said for nearly every institution that makes up the nation's commanding heights. These institutions, DeSantis argued, are being held hostage by \"a cabal of people who will go berserk if they don't get their way\"-zealots with \"a very strong ideological impulse\" that manages to overwhelm whatever institutional structures get in their way.\n\n\"Sometimes you just need an executive to come in and tell them to pound sand,\" DeSantis said with a firm rap on his desk. \"Sorry!\"\n\nIn a phone interview, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts agreed with DeSantis's evaluation, noting that the left's campaign to capture the nation's institutions has come with the \"demise of what social scientists would call the mediating institutions of civil society.\"\n\n\"Over that span of time when the left has essentially captured most large businesses, what also has happened is the deterioration of the nuclear family, the assault on biological sex, and construing that as gender, and obviously, the demise of traditional marriage,\" Roberts said.\n\n\"The absence of institutions that can help them withstand that pressure,\" Roberts went on to say, leads to \"this institutional demise is vitally important to understanding what's going on in America.\"\n\nDeSantis has a simple message for Disney if it wants to correct its course: \"Just focus on being family-friendly.\" He and Florida legislators had some ideas to take Disney's potential distractions off their plate so they can focus on just that.\n\n\"When Disney first came out against the bill [H.B. 1557],\" DeSantis said, \"people in the legislature started floating this idea of going after Reedy Creek.\"\n\nIn 1958, Walt started considering a larger project out east. Disneyland, which opened just three years earlier, had become a massive success. Once the park opened, however, real estate prices in the surrounding area soared as kitschy themed hotels and other attractions moved in. That infuriated Walt, who wanted to prevent a repeat of the Anaheim situation for his next project by buying up enough land to insulate the park and ensure total control over the area.\n\nThe mission was top secret. If their plans somehow got out, property prices would likely skyrocket as they did in Anaheim. But how was one of the most famous companies in America, led by one of the nation's most famous men, going to purchase thousands of acres and not raise eyebrows? Conveniently, key figures on Disney's land-acquisition team had counterintelligence experience and connections, which they used to obscure the company's plans in Florida. Written memorandums were avoided as much as possible, but when they were needed, each copy of a memo was numbered, assigned, returned, and then accounted for by the distributor. Calls from Florida to California were rerouted through New York to disguise Disney's involvement. Subscriptions to local papers in Florida were taken out under aliases, initials, nicknames, or the names of their secretaries, and addressed to post office boxes.\n\nRobert P. Foster, Disney's assistant secretary and legal counsel, spearheaded the land acquisition effort. Foster was connected with Miami-based attorney Paul L.E. Helliwell, who, according to a CIA document, was the \"chief of special intelligence in China,\" for the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA.\n\nBy spring of 1965, the team managed to purchase over 43 square miles, twice the size of Manhattan, for about $5 million-a per-acre cost of under $200. The operation had been a success.\n\nOn the plane back to California after the November 15, 1965, press conference, Walt's attorneys and advisors started to ask him about the state's involvement with their future plans. The best course of action, they advised, was to establish their own municipality. Disney needed more convincing.\n\nAs planning got underway, Disney established a think-tank of sorts for the Florida project. The attorneys and experts he brought in found that Florida Statute Chapter 298 allowed for the creation of a drainage district via district court approval, which would enable Disney to drain and redirect water using canals and build other infrastructure, like bridges, to make the property more accessible. What got Roy Disney excited about the prospect of a drainage district, however, was that it could sell bonds to fund its work.\n\nDisney's bid to establish the Reedy Creek Drainage District was approved in May 1966, but the brain trust realized they needed more power if the project was to unfold and operate as planned. Their attorneys and experts said Disney needed to exercise broad authority over infrastructure projects, building codes, utilities, and transportation systems, and receive exemptions from state statutes, county ordinances, and other regulatory bodies. Disney also wanted to seek more financial powers, such as the ability to issue bonds and securities and levy its own taxes, among other things.\n\nMore than anything, Walt wanted total control; he agreed with the plan. As the attorneys grappled with the legalities, Walt did what he did best: envision the future. He made what would become known as the EPCOT film, detailing his plans more concretely than ever before for the Florida property, and showed it to his team.\n\nLess than two months later, on December 15, 1966, Walt Disney died.\n\nRoy, the numbers nerd, would have to fill in the shoes of his imaginative little brother and sell his vision to the state's people, its representatives, and the press. In February 1967, Disney hosted a press event at the Park West Theater in Winter Park, Florida. After the EPCOT film played, Roy stood where his brother would have stood just a few months prior: in the spotlight.\n\n\"Wasn't that a dream?\" Roy asked the audience. \"It cannot be done without the help of you people here in Florida...we must have a solid legal foundation before we can proceed with Disney World.... This foundation can be assured by the legislative proposals we are presenting to the next session of the Florida legislature.\"\n\nOn April 19, 1967, Disney's legislation was officially introduced in the Florida House and Senate. Disney played the EPCOT film again, on both the House and Senate floor. By mid-May, the 481-page piece of legislation was signed into law with minimal changes from Disney's suggested language.\n\n\"The interesting thing about that is, as governor, I never dealt with Reedy Creek,\" DeSantis said. \"I had no concept of all they had, because it just never came up. No one ever talked about it. It was never raised with me.\"\n\nDeSantis and his team started digging. What they found astonished the governor: \"The amount of privileges they have and special treatment was unbelievable. It was unlike anything else we've ever seen.\"\n\nIn late March 2022, DeSantis began publicly floating the idea of taking away Disney's special privileges. \"Because the state should be governed by the best interests of the people, you should not have one organization that is able to dictate policy in all these different realms,\" DeSantis said at a March 31, 2022, press conference.\n\nIn our conversation, the governor said that Florida has many \"community development districts\"-over 1,000 of them, actually, including Cape Canaveral and the Daytona race track. Such a district, of itself, is \"not uncommon...but to have one company run the government and have these extraordinary powers?\" That was unusual and troubling.\n\n\"For example, they had the ability to do eminent domain outside the district's boundaries. So you have a subdivision somewhere on the outskirts of Reedy Creek-Disney could seize that for them to be able to do more infrastructure for the district.\" Such an arrangement, the governor argued, was \"untenable,\" \"unjustifiable,\" and \"really, really obnoxious.\"\n\nThe voters recognized that long before a lot of Florida Republicans did, the governor suggested. \"Disney had this veneer of invincibility politically so that no one would even look at this.\" But because of the company's opposition to H.B. 1557, \"Disney had fallen out of favor with our base,\" and, thus, became \"unpopular with a lot of the legislators.\" Voters pressed the Reedy Creek issue, imploring the governor that Reedy Creek should be no more. The governor heard them.\n\nIn the middle of April 2022, DeSantis said the legislature would be taking up a bill to dismantle the Reedy Creek Improvement District during a special legislative session, which was devised originally to consider the new congressional map. By that afternoon, committees in both the Florida state House and Senate had advanced measures that would put an end to Reedy Creek and five other special districts on June 1, 2023.\n\nThe day after its proposal, the Senate voted in favor of the legislation, S.B. 4C, nearly two to one. The House did the same by a similar margin. The governor promptly signed the bill into law the following day.\n\n\"When you have a leader with courage, it gives everyone else political cover to follow him, and that's what conservatives need is someone who has the courage to lead,\" Florida State Rep. Spencer Roach told me in a phone interview. \"People will follow, people will respond.\"\n\nBut there were problems associated with just outright ending Reedy Creek. And they were big ones. First, the unique positioning of Reedy Creek between Orange and Osceola counties made splitting responsibilities-emergency services, infrastructure maintenance, water, utilities, sewage, et cetera-a nightmare. Then there was the question of Reedy Creek's outstanding liabilities. The special tax district status Reedy Creek provided Disney meant that the district essentially taxed the company at the tune of $105 million per year to pay for such municipal services. Furthermore, Disney forked over about $60 million per year to Reedy Creek in order for the district to pay its debts on bonds. Essentially, Disney would subsidize itself for the upkeep of the property and the payments of its debts.\n\nUnder the initial plan to strip Disney of its privileges, Disney might not have been the only ones up a Reedy Creek-Orange and Osceola counties might have been, too.\n\nThe counties would be without the powers Reedy Creek had to directly tax Disney, meaning some of those costs would be passed on to local taxpayers. There was about $1 billion in debt that Orange and Osceola county residents would ultimately bear responsibility for servicing. To offset those liabilities, some experts estimated property taxes would increase between 20 to 25 percent. The measure's detractors, especially the media, clamored that Disney's burden would become Orange and Osceola's. DeSantis said this reaction to sun-setting Reedy Creek was vastly overblown.\n\n\"I told them that's not true, that's not going to happen, Disney's going to pay,\" DeSantis said. But the point of passing the legislation to end Reedy Creek in April of 2022 was to start a running clock for the state government to find a long-term resolution to the conflict with Disney.\n\n\"We weren't comfortable just letting it [Reedy Creek] go, because the Orange County government was saying they're going to raise people's taxes and we wanted to protect the taxpayers,\" DeSantis explained.\n\nDisney wasn't prepared to let Reedy Creek, and all the powers it granted, go either.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, DeSantis and Florida legislators finished what they started the year prior. In February, DeSantis signed legislation that took control of Reedy Creek Improvement District and renamed it the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.\n\nIt's no silver bullet, but having an appointed state board take control seemed to solve the major practical and political challenges that would have accompanied simply destroying Reedy Creek.\n\n\"One of the factors,\" in deciding to have a state board take control, the governor said, \"was there is about 900 million in unsecured municipal debt that they [Disney's Reedy Creek] had racked up.\" Furthermore, there were political concerns. For example, \"we didn't know, because Orange County's local government is going to be hostile to me politically, if they would have just contracted back with Disney to give them self-government,\" DeSantis explained. The best way to deal with that issue and others, the governor and his allies found, was appointing \"a state control board.\"\n\nUnder the prior arrangement, Disney was allowed to appoint all five of the district's board members. As of early March when the legislation took effect, that job now falls to the Florida governor.\n\nThe legislation signed by DeSantis, H.B. 9, is a lengthy 191 pages, which is fitting, given the state government has essentially had to reestablish an entire municipality that will once again find itself under meaningful control of the state. Beyond revoking Disney's self-governing status, the legislation also puts an end to Disney's exemptions from Florida building and fire-prevention codes, exceptions from state regulatory reviews and approvals, and its immunity from certain tax burdens. Florida law will be fully enforced, and Disney will still be responsible for the debts it racked up while in charge of Reedy Creek.\n\nFor DeSantis, it's not a revolution. It's a restoration. \"Allowing a corporation to control its own government is bad policy, especially when the corporation makes decisions that impact an entire region,\" DeSantis proclaimed upon signing the legislation. \"This legislation ends Disney's self-governing status, makes Disney live under the same laws as everybody else, and ensures that Disney pays its debts and fair share of taxes.\"\n\nDisney wasn't going to willingly relinquish control over the land and power it had fought so hard to obtain. This media empire strikes back.\n\nBefore DeSantis signed H.B. 9 in late February, the Disney-controlled Reedy Creek board entered into an agreement with Disney with the purpose of neutralizing the incoming takeover. The agreement, entered into on February 8-just two days before the Florida Senate passed the legislation that would later become law-essentially gave total control of the complex's 27,000 acres directly to Disney.\n\nThis had been, in effect, how things were with the Disney-appointed board. But to save its privileges, Disney was willing to drop all pretense of mediating institutions and take direct control at a corporate level.\n\nThe February 8 agreement, essentially struck between Disney and itself, outlines a \"declaration of restrictive covenants\" and includes a royal lives clause, which states that the agreement is valid until \"21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, king of England.\"\n\nApparently, the Florida government and DeSantis's new board were unaware of the agreement until the board attempted to assume control of the district. The agreement \"essentially makes Disney the government,\" Ron Peri, one of the DeSantis appointed board members, told the Orlando Sentinel . \"This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.\"\n\nDisney has stood by its actions. In a statement to Deadline , the Walt Disney World Resort said, \"All agreements signed between Disney and the District were appropriate, and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine law.\" It does appear that the agreement and associated governmental activity was filed with the Orange County Comptroller-there is a record of the agreement on its website dated February 9.\n\nAlan Lawson, an attorney representing the DeSantis-appointed board in its current suit against Disney, as well as a former Florida Supreme Court justice and founding partner of the firm Lawson Huck Gonzalez, argued that the parties did not in fact act in accordance with Florida law.\n\n\"The law in Florida says if a governmental entity is going to enter this kind of contract, it has to follow a very specific public notice to give an opportunity for anybody who has an interest to be heard in a meeting in the sunshine. And Disney, sitting as its own governmental entity, ignored required procedural rules,\" Lawson explained. \"What you have is what purports to be a validly entered contract under Florida law, but it's not at all a validly entered contract.\"\n\nDeSantis, the Republican legislature, and the appointed board weren't going to take the agreement lying down. The board quickly voted to nullify the early February agreement. The governor announced on April 17 the government's intent to pass legislation that would revoke the self-contract Disney signed in the waning hours of its reign over Reedy Creek. He said that Disney is \"going to live under the same laws as everybody else, pay their fair share of taxes, and honor the debts that they've accumulated over these years.\"\n\nDeSantis, citing Florida law, argued that the state reserves the right to revoke development agreements like the one Disney signed in early February. His administration vowed to see Disney in court.\n\nDisney decided to sue the state first. The media mammoth filed a lawsuit on April 26 alleging DeSantis and other state political leaders are waging a \"targeted campaign of government retaliation\" that violates Disney's First Amendment and contract rights.\n\n\"What the legislature did was affect Reedy Creek, which is a public entity,\" DeSantis replied when asked about Disney's lawsuit and the support it has garnered from some right-leaning libertarians. \"They didn't do anything to touch Disney's free speech rights. Did they pull ABC's broadcast license? Did they say Disney can't speak out about anything? Of course not. They took a government that had been authorized by the state of Florida that, yes, had been basically corrupted by Disney's influence and run by Disney, and they put accountability on it.\"\n\n\"I mean, the idea you have a First Amendment right to corporate welfare or having a local government that you basically control with no accountability is ridiculous,\" the governor scoffed.\n\n\"The interesting thing about the Disney example is that DeSantis wasn't going after Disney because Disney was being woke,\" Oren Cass, executive director of American Compass, commented. \"Disney can put whatever crap it wants on the Disney Channel, and that wasn't necessarily going to elicit a response. What elicited response was Disney's decision to try to get involved in the political process.\"\n\n\"That's another really interesting challenge for the right of center is the sort of Citizens United-era assumption, that there's no problem with corporations speaking, they're just people, is probably not a very good one,\" Cass continued. \"I think there's some very interesting rethinking of Citizens United starting to happen.\"\n\nLess than a week later, the DeSantis-appointed board filed their own lawsuit in Orange County, Florida. The Magic Kingdom, the lawsuit claims, wanted to maintain its \"fiefdom,\" whereas the board is seeking to \"restore the people's sovereignty.\" Because this agreement was entered into in \"haste or arrogance\" and \"reek[s] of a backroom deal,\" it should be declared \"null and void-not even worth the paper they were printed on.\"\n\nLawson explained to me in a phone interview that the legislature was well within its rights to revoke Disney's special privileges. \"The sovereign is the state of Florida, and under the Florida constitution, the Constitution gives the legislature the power to create local government. One of the ways that the legislature can exercise that power is by creating counties, which is specifically provided for in the constitution. It can change them, it can abolish them, it can create cities, change them, and abolish them, because the legislature is the policy-making branch of the state.\"\n\nDisney had \"extraordinary privileges for decades that allowed it to police itself and be its own government,\" Lawson later stated. \"Regardless of political party, if you generally ask people, is this a good idea to put a private for-profit corporation in charge of its own government without any accountability of government, most people would say no, that that's not a good idea. When the legislature acted, it simply restored things to normal order for Disney under [a] legitimate governmental body.\"\n\nDeSantis said the board will continue to \"systematically put Disney under the law of the state of Florida, which is what we promised.\"\n\n\"There's a real opportunity to create more prosperity,\" Martin Garcia, chairman of the newly-minted Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, said in a phone interview. \"What we're currently stuck in, if you think about it, is an urban planning model that was designed in 1967. It's a dinosaur from an urban planning perspective, and it makes perfectly good sense that we bring it into the 21st century.\"\n\n\"Urban planning wasn't even a profession in 1967,\" Garcia continued, \"and so there's all sorts of concepts that can be brought into the district from an urban planning standpoint to change things that make it more prosperous for more people.\"\n\nAs the governor leaned back in his chair behind the governor's desk, I couldn't help but get the feeling that, among the American right, DeSantis is well aware he's pushing the envelope.\n\nOver the past three years in particular, through Covid-19, DeSantis has built a brand as a no-nonsense conservative. While the governor, like the Floridians he's been elected to represent, often frames these policy debates as \"normal versus woke\" and \"common sense versus leftist insanity,\" the fundamental questions about his style of governance, particularly when it comes to Disney, are not lost on him. He is well aware he is challenging the establishment right's preferred way of politics.\n\n\"What is a free market?\" DeSantis shot back, cutting me off mid-question as I cited other right-of-center writers that complained DeSantis did not have adequate \"fealty\" to free-market principles.\n\n\"Does an absence of government necessarily mean free market?\" DeSantis asked rhetorically. \"I would say, sometimes, absence of government could just devolve into corporatism, and I think too many people on the right have basically been corporatists over the years.\"\n\n\"What even is the free market is exactly the right [question],\" Cass said when I told him about DeSantis's comment. \"The analogy I've started drawing that I think makes sense, is what do we mean by democracy? By democracy, we don't mean everybody just votes on everything. Democracy is shorthand for actually a very sophisticated system of institutions with constraints and checks and balances.\"\n\n\"Why is it that well intentioned, smart, free-market advocates have such a problem with what DeSantis is doing with Disney?\" Roberts asked. \"It's because they're conflating the free market in theory, or the free market as an ideal, with mostly what we have in the United States today, which is corporatism.\" From Roberts's perspective, \"Disney, like so many other Fortune 500 companies, has just lived at the trough of corporatism for too long, and then they shield themselves in the fake armor of the free market, when in fact, it isn't the free market at all.\"\n\nWhen it comes to markets, \"for conservatives, there are obviously a lot of things to really like,\" Cass said. But conservatives differ from libertarians or free-market fundamentalists, in that they are willing to \"recognize plenty of things to be concerned about when it comes to markets.\" Markets \"don't take consideration of the many other non-market values that are as important if not more to human flourishing.\"\n\nThose \"shilling for Disney\" need to come to terms with the fact that \"corporate America is not your friend on a lot of things,\" DeSantis added, and if you \"defer to corporations, you're going to end up seeing the economy and society go in ways that may not be advantageous for the majority of the people.\"\n\nHis libertarian critics might bemoan our current welfare state, but they're for a welfare of a different kind: corporate welfare.\n\n\"If you're a libertarian, how do you justify Reedy Creek? That's the opposite of libertarianism,\" DeSantis said with a firm, instructive tone towards his detractors. \"It is corporate welfare,\" DeSantis added. \"We are under no obligation as a state to continue that arrangement.\" Failing to act when a massive company with quasi-governmental powers vows \"to wage a jihad against this bill legislatively means we're subsidizing that activity\" amounts to subsidizing that behavior, DeSantis suggested. \"Why would we want to subsidize that?\"\n\nRoach agreed. \"What people in D.C. fail to recognize is the distinction between capitalism and crony capitalism,\" he said. \"And what has been allowed to happen with Disney over the last sixty years in Florida, it is, in my opinion, the most outrageous, the most egregious and the most naked example of crony capitalism in the history of America.\"\n\nThe problem goes beyond the fact that Disney has gone \"woke.\" Our current economic structure has empowered many large companies with \"quasi-public power\" that \"should cause us to be more engaged,\" DeSantis argued.\n\n\"We've given them special privileges associated with sovereign governments, and let them exploit that to the economic disadvantage of people who would be their competitors,\" Roach said, echoing the governor's stance. \"That's simply wrong. That should not be allowed to happen in the state of Florida, it should not be allowed to happen in the United States.\"\n\n\"If you look at some of these companies, like Google, and look at the footprint that they have, they don't necessarily offend historical antitrust law because the antitrust law is focusing on jacking up prices on people,\" DeSantis admitted. \"But I would say they're exercising way more power than Standard Oil ever did, or any of the trust of the early 20th century. So the question is, is it okay to have a handful of private power centers that really, really dominate our society? And is it appropriate to have something like an antitrust principle applied there? I think it probably would be appropriate.\"\n\n\"Protecting what we believe is a free society,\" for DeSantis, means preventing \"social transformation without representation.\"\n\n\"We're a distinct country. We have a distinct people, and that needs to mean something. We have an identifiable culture. We have identifiable traditions,\" he went on to say. \"And I think a lot of [the left's] project is to really undermine a lot of the institutions and traditions and values that have stood the test of time.\"\n\nBy using private actors to wield public power, the left, progressive and neoliberal, circumvents the will of the people. \"Why would they try to do that? Because they want to delegitimize the founding of this country. Delegitimize the institutions that that generation spawned, and then say, you know what, our founding principles need to be modern day leftist ideology,\" DeSantis told me.\n\n\"What Americans writ large are realizing is this is our moment.\" Roberts said, commenting on the way DeSantis seems to be leading the charge against the left's cultural agenda. \"This is our moment to demand that our politicians use the power they have. This is the moment for us to demand of companies, whether they're Google, or Facebook, or Disney, that you listen to us, rather than ram down our throats and into our own families all of the garbage that you've been pushing on us. This is our time to demand that you do what we say. And it's glorious.\"\n\n\"A lot of these fights are really foundational fights about what it means to be an American,\" DeSantis said as our interview came to an end. \"So, it's something that we fight for.\"\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "How can Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis recover from his failed presidential campaign?\n\nA federal judge has dismissed the Walt Disney Company's lawsuit against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. It is yet another win for the Florida governor, and likely his most important win to date given it is his first major victory since suspending his disappointing presidential campaign.\n\nUpon dropping out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination, DeSantis endorsed Trump and has refocused on what has been the most popular state in conservative circles since DeSantis's tenure as governor began. Has the DeSantis redemption arc begun?\n\nOn Wednesday in Tallahassee, U.S. District Judge Allen Winsor rendered his decision that Disney lacked standing in its First Amendment lawsuit against the Florida governor, in which the entertainment behemoth claimed that the Florida government's efforts to dismantle Disney's special privileges was reprisal for Disney's opposition to the Parental Rights in Education Act. Disney's lawsuit, filed April 26, 2023, claimed that DeSantis's government was waging a \"relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint,\" and that DeSantis's \"targeted campaign of government retaliation...now threatens Disney's business operations, jeopardizes its economic future in the region and violates its constitutional rights.\"\n\nJust prior to the launch of his presidential campaign, I traveled down to Tallahassee to interview DeSantis on the alleged war on Disney and its broader implications-how DeSantis thinks about sovereignty, the economy, and, what would become most important in the months that followed, executive power and its uses.\n\n\"What the legislature did was affect Reedy Creek, which is a public entity,\" DeSantis told me then in defense of the Florida government's actions. As for Disney's lawsuit, \"[the legislature] didn't do anything to touch Disney's free speech rights. Did they pull ABC's broadcast license? Did they say Disney can't speak out about anything? Of course not.\"\n\n\"The idea you have a First Amendment right to corporate welfare or having a local government that you basically control with no accountability is ridiculous,\" the governor said at one point. \"Sometimes you just need an executive to come in and tell them to pound sand,\" DeSantis said at another.\n\nWinsor's decision to dismiss the case ended up being much narrower in scope than DeSantis's portrayal of the issues at the heart of Florida's battle with Disney. This is par for the course when it comes to the right-sympathetic members of the court (Winsor is a Trump appointee), but that doesn't make DeSantis' diagnosis in any way incorrect.\n\nIn the 17-page decision, Winsor claimed that Disney did not have standing to sue DeSantis because DeSantis had already appointed members to the board of the governing district. \"Because Disney seeks injunctive relief, it must allege an imminent future injury,\" Winsor's decision argued, \"and it has not alleged facts showing that any imminent future appointments will contribute to its harm.\" The only harm he saw was that Disney has to operate \"under a board it cannot control.\"\n\nThe judge also argued that a party cannot challenge a constitutional law on free-speech grounds because the party believes there were unconstitutional motives. \"It is settled law that 'when a statute is facially constitutional, a plaintiff cannot bring a free-speech challenge by claiming that the lawmakers who passed it acted with a constitutionally impermissible purpose,'\" Winsor claimed.\n\nFurthermore, Winsor pointed out that the law that stripped Disney World's privileges did not single out the company by name, but rather targeted a group of Florida's many special districts.\n\nWhile Disney \"faces the brunt of the harm,\" Winsor admitted, \"No one reading the text of the challenged laws would suppose them directed against Disney.\"\n\n\"The laws do not mention Disney.... There is no 'close enough' exception,\" wrote Winsor.\n\nDisney has appealed the decision and claimed in a statement that \"this is an important case with serious implications for the rule of law, and it will not end here. If left unchallenged, this would set a dangerous precedent and give license to states to weaponize their official powers to punish the expression of political viewpoints they disagree with.\" The case now makes its way to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Meanwhile, other lawsuits, one lodged by the appointed members of the newly minted Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD) against Disney and Disney returning fire in a countersuit, make their way through the state court system. Disney's motion to dismiss the CFTOD case was previously denied, and the next phase of the lawsuit is slated to begin in March.\n\nIf DeSantis can continue to score victories not only in the courtroom against Disney, but for more conservative priorities in the increasingly red, electorally crucial state of Florida in his final two years as governor, is it safe to start liking Ron DeSantis again?\n\nThere may be other opportunities in store for DeSantis, too, if Trump takes back the White House this November. In a recent column , my TAC colleague Jude Russo drew a comparison between DeSantis and Trump to Augustus and Agrippa. \"DeSantis is an Agrippa,\" Russo wrote.  \"Effective but unlovely.... It would be folly and a great shame to leave him unused in a Trump cabinet.\"\n\nThe art of statesmanship is part visionary, part technocratic. Trump has always had the vision, but his lack of governmental know-how opened him up to all kinds of betrayals stemming from personnel who had the know-how but refused to support the president's vision. DeSantis, at least when it comes to the Sunshine state (whether his strategy is scalable to the national level is another question), has that know-how to effectuate Trump's vision if Trump commands him to sic'em.\n\nIt's no small coincidence that what DeSantis's presidential campaign lacked most was vision and optics. On the stump, strange verbal and facial tics, posture, and his alleged platform shoes plagued DeSantis's doomed presidential campaign. (It's worth noting that when I interviewed DeSantis in his office last year, he didn't have any of these problems.) It was apparent in his retail politics, too. He shook babies and kissed hands when it should have been the other way around. It led to a prevailing narrative that DeSantis was inauthentic or even downright autistic.\n\nHow does DeSantis recover? When your star shines a little less brightly, it might be best to operate-efficiently, silently, ruthlessly-in the shadows.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "Florida's governor can't win, but he can split the right's vote against Nikki Haley.\n\nDonald Trump is running to be the Republican nominee for president. After the Iowa caucuses, what are Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley running for?\n\n\"Second\" is the obvious answer. But if that's the case, Florida's Governor DeSantis, the second-place finisher in Iowa, is in serious trouble.\n\nHe was ahead of Ambassador Haley by just 2 points by the time networks declared him Iowa's runner-up. If DeSantis could hardly put any distance between himself and Haley after campaigning for a year and visiting every one of the state's 99 counties, what are his prospects for clinging to second for the rest of the race to the nomination?\n\nIn the next two major battlegrounds, DeSantis is guaranteed to place third-with greater odds that he'll be a distant third to Haley than that he'll finish as close to her in New Hampshire or South Carolina as she finished to him in Iowa.\n\nJohn McCain crushed George W. Bush in the 2000 New Hampshire primary, winning by more than 18 points. If a next-generation McCain-style candidate can finish a strong second to Trump anywhere-or even have a prayer of beating him-it's in New Hampshire. And Nikki Haley is a Netflix or Kathleen Kennedy update of John McCain: his politics in a woman's body.\n\nConservative pundits noticed that Haley, in her remarks to supporters after the caucuses, said the contest for the nomination was now a two-person race. That seemed odd coming from a candidate who finished third. Yet she spoke truthfully-New Hampshire, if it's a race at all, is a Trump-Haley race, and Haley's home state of South Carolina is not going to boost DeSantis back to #2. After losing to Haley-not just Trump-in the Granite State and Palmetto State, what kind of momentum will DeSantis have for the rest of the race?\n\nMore to the point, who is going to write the checks to let him keep losing?\n\nIn their one-on-one Iowa debate on Jan. 10, Haley asked DeSantis what kind of leadership he'd displayed by burning through $150 million in his campaign to date. We now know that money bought a distant second in the nation's first contest, 30 points behind Trump. DeSantis says he isn't about to drop out. His paymasters may say otherwise.\n\nThis is an expensive, painful lesson for one of the most successful Republican governors in the country, a man who should be in the top ranks of the party's prospective nominees for 2028. His 2024 campaign, however, has done him more harm than good. It's an absolute scandal-he had money, he had momentum after his landslide 2022 re-election, and he had a record of conservative policy success. Even if all of that couldn't beat Trump, why couldn't it beat Nikki Haley by more than 2 points in Iowa, with the state's Republican governor and evangelical leaders in DeSantis's corner?\n\nIt would be a mistake to write off DeSantis's successes as governor, including his electoral success in that role, because of the dismal performance of his presidential campaign. But if the 45-year-old governor wants to build toward another run for the White House, with lessons learned and times more favorable-when there's no Trump on the ballot, for one things-he has to find the most creditable way possible to euthanize his 2024 bid.\n\nAs things stand, DeSantis now functions as Haley's most valuable ally. He splits the right-wing primary vote with Trump, while Haley has the pseudo-moderate lane all to herself. Chris Christie, no less proud than DeSantis, shut down his campaign against Trump when it was clear all he could do was hurt Haley. With Christie's vote added to what was already hers, and with Democrats free to vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary, Haley can narrow the margin with Trump in the first and second full-on primaries. This will buy her more good press from a media eager to find angles for embarrassing Trump and dividing Republicans. Her donor list will grow accordingly-and that's what the Haley campaign is all about.\n\nEven a first-place finish in New Hampshire and a razor-close second in South Carolina-improbable but not altogether impossible dreams-would not set Haley up to win the Republican nomination. Nor will she win Trump's favor, with an eye to becoming his vice president, by persisting as a rival to him. Yet she will keep going, and her sponsors will keep paying, because they are building an enterprise that isn't primarily about Trump, but rather what happens after Trump. Just as Barry Goldwater's failed campaigns of 1960 (when he didn't get the nomination) and 1964 (when he did) created networks of activists and small-dollar donors who could institutionalize Goldwater's ideology in the form of the conservative movement, Haley's campaign is the embryo of a neoconservative rebirth.\n\nShe's no Goldwater, and her supporters, who are barely Republicans when they are Republicans at all, are nothing like the conservative cadres for Goldwater. But they are still the stuff from which an influential movement can be made: There is plenty of money available for politicians like Haley (her team outspent DeSantis on the airwaves in Iowa), and educated voters with a reflexive disdain for populism are a significant demographic, even if they are a minority within the GOP. If this faction could find a single leader in 2028 or beyond, and if the populist right splinters after Trump, the Bush-Cheney wing of the party could yet live again. Even short of capturing the presidential nomination in the future, this wing, if revived, could wield considerable power through congressional offices, presidential appointments, the federal bureaucracy, think tanks, and media. Crudely put, the Haley campaign is an attempt to use Barry Goldwater's means for Bill Kristols' ends.\n\nThere is no advantage for DeSantis, as he looks toward the future, in helping Haley anti-populist forces within the GOP. The Florida governor is a proud man, and he has much of which to be proud, his disappointing showing in Iowa notwithstanding. But he was ill-served by those who told him 2024 was his \"moment,\" and he will be ill-advised to remain in the race without a hope of winning. There are no better results awaiting him after Iowa, and in the next two major contests there are clearly worse ones.\n\nIt's true that he and Trump are the only candidates still in the race who are on the ballot for the Feb. 8 Nevada caucuses-but the chance of anyone gaining momentum from that contest is minimized by the fact that Nevada is also holding a primary on Feb. 6, in which Haley will be on the ballot but Trump and DeSantis will not. (The Nevada primary awards no Republican delegates; only the caucuses count. But this bizarre situation is sure to cause confusion about who's a winner or loser in the Silver State.)\n\nPresidential hopefuls sometimes entertain the thought that even if they can't win caucuses and primaries in terms of vote totals, they can do better than their raw numbers suggest by netting delegates through the arcane electoral machinery that awards the representatives who get the final say on the nomination at the Republican National Convention. This dream of winning after first losing is hallucinatory. And DeSantis is well past the point where he can afford to be unrealistic.\n\nVoters in Iowa, courted for a year, made a choice on Monday that foreclosed on Ron DeSantis's hopes for 2024. The sooner he admits that, and asks what went wrong not with his luck but with his campaign, the better off he and the party will be in the future. He has two more years to serve as Florida's governor. That's where his most important battles, and his victories, will be. By staying in the presidential race without a path to the nomination, he can only detract from Trump while harming himself.

      "text": "Trump's secret is not how he flouts convention but how he projects moderation.\n\nOne year ago, the conservative intellectual class coalesced around Ron DeSantis. At the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, the governor of Florida enjoyed a kind of \"coronation,\" as the writer Park MacDougald observed. Initially, it looked like these people had chosen well. The governor had an impressive record. In November 2022, as Republicans came up short in several closely watched races, DeSantis cruised to victory, winning reelection as governor of Florida by 20 points. Trump was dead; DeSantis was the man of the future.\n\nOr so it seemed. Today Trump leads the Republican field, with DeSantis running a distant second. In January, DeSantis was supported by 35 percent of Republican primary voters. Now he polls at 14 percent. DeSantis entered the race with $110 million in campaign funds. He now has a mere $5 million available to spend, around half of the amount available to his rival Nikki Haley.\n\nWhat went wrong? Some things were outside the campaign's control. Most notably, indictments of Trump only seemed to solidify the former president's support among primary voters. But one error was eminently avoidable. The DeSantis campaign-at least large portions of its communications team-chose to operate under the assumption that Trump won in 2016 by being deliberately weird and extreme, as if he had won election by acting as an avatar of the weirder corners of the online right.\n\nThis comically wrong conclusion led to some of the most bizarre moments of the campaign. In early July, the DeSantis campaign produced an interview boasting in DeSantis's opposition to LGBT causes and presenting Trump as compromised. It was a very \"online\" production, complete with emojis and music no boomer would recognize. It intercut images of DeSantis with ones of Patrick Bateman, Brad Pitt dressed as a Greek warrior, and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street . This fantasia culminated with an image of a nearly naked bodybuilder whose bulging muscles glistened with oil. Critics couldn't decide whether to denounce it as homophobic or laugh at it as unintentional camp.\n\nSomething even stranger happened later that month, when the DeSantis campaign put together a video filled with images of women in string bikinis and rockets taking off. It concluded with the image of uniformed men marching toward the Great Leader Ron DeSantis, over whom a sonnenrad appeared. The sonnenrad, sometimes referred to as the Black Sun, is associated with neo-nazi movements and is sometimes worn by fighters in Ukraine's Azov Battallion. This Busby Berkeley jackboot fantasy was set to a song from Kate Bush, a singer hailed by Diva magazine as an \"eternal queer icon.\"\n\nBoth videos were produced internally and sent to external actors for unattributed publication. The intent of this subterfuge was to make it seem as though DeSantis had grassroots support-meme magic-on the online right. It reflected the campaign's acceptance of the idea that Trump won because various odd online subcultures gathered around him.\n\nWeird as these antics may seem, they reflect broader mistakes by the post-Trump right. Trump won by saying some unacceptable things. This led many to conclude that the right would win if it only had the courage to be less inhibited and more extreme.\n\nUnfortunately, many failed to notice that one of the main reasons for Trump's success was his surprising moderation, even his strange normality. To be sure, Trump flouted all kinds of conventions, often unadvisedly. But in many ways he tacked toward the center.\n\nAs other Republicans denounced Obamacare, Trump made sympathetic noises about public health care. When Ted Cruz accused him of supporting socialized medicine, Trump said, \"I will not let people die on the streets.\" Likewise, Trump rejected Republican calls for cutting entitlements and called an end to nation-building. In all these ways, he tacked away from the ideological extreme.\n\nThe center Trump appealed to wasn't that of the college-educated class, but one approximating the views of many less educated voters. It responded to his opposition to immigration, and didn't mind his deviation from conservative orthodoxy.\n\nTrump's normality at times frustrated social conservatives. Even as he hammered Democrats for being extreme on abortion and promised to appoint pro-life justices, he presented himself as a moderate. The same was true on LGBT issues, where Trump's moderation was made more manifest, to the frustration of social conservatives.\n\nA lot of this has been lost on Trump fans who take him as a model of the importance of being \"based,\" a term that originally referred to someone who free-bases cocaine-and resultingly flouts the demands of sober society. Trump did have the courage to puncture some false pieties. But he was never indifferent to what normal people wanted and found appealing. Even when he seemed extreme, he was trying to appeal to people who have no interest in boutique ideologies.\n\nThose glad to have cast aside the catechism of yesterday's GOP should not imagine that it can be replaced by a more esoteric ideology. Since Trump's election, rightwing \"-isms\" have seemed to proliferate endlessly. While there are insights in some of these, all suffer from a lack of contact with reality. The American right has spent the last several years getting weird. It might be time for a return to normality.\n\nThis article appears in the November/December 2023 issue\n\nMatthew Schmitz is a founder and editor of Compact magazine, and a contributing editor at The American Conservative .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "The Florida governor's recent comments about the war in Ukraine sent the establishment into a tailspin.\n\nIn the early days of every presidential primary season, foreign policy observers scrutinize every public comment made by governors with presidential aspirations about foreign affairs, seeking to cobble together the candidates' potential doctrines. Once these observers have a feel for a governor's potential foreign policy approach, they rush to offer their services out of pure selflessness (and for a small recurring consulting sum). Unsurprisingly, the most anticipated governor-turned-potential-presidential-candidate is Ron DeSantis, who has become a household name due to his success as the governor of Florida and seems to be the only Republican that could pose a real primary challenge to former President Donald Trump.\n\nThough DeSantis previously served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee during his five-year stint in Congress, he is quick to remind the public he's focused on Florida. And while there's still much to learn about DeSantis's current views on foreign policy, his recent comments about the war in Ukraine sent the establishment, which surely has machinations to co-opt a DeSantis presidential campaign, into a tailspin.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson had sent a questionnaire to declared and suspected candidates for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination about the war in Ukraine. The questions were simple enough. Among them: Is opposing Russia in Ukraine a vital American national strategic interest? What specifically is our objective in Ukraine, and how will we know when we've achieved it? What is the limit of funding and materiel you would be willing to send to the government of Ukraine? Should the United States support regime change in Russia?\n\nThe clear front-runner among the declared candidates, former President Donald Trump, gave answers that were provocative yet expected. Regarding regime change in Russia, Trump replied, \"No. We should support regime change in the United States, that's far more important. The Biden administration are the ones who got us into this mess.\" The former president's pointed answers weren't received with consternation from the pro-war establishment because Trump has long been supportive of a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nDeSantis hinted that his foreign policy views, at least when it comes to Ukraine, are very much in line with Trump's, though his answers were not so punchy.\n\n\"Becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of [the United States' vital national interests]. The Biden administration's virtual 'blank check' funding of this conflict for 'as long as it takes,' without any defined objectives or accountability, distracts from our country's most pressing challenges,\" DeSantis wrote to Carlson.\n\n\"Without question, peace should be the objective,\" DeSantis added. \"The U.S. should not provide assistance that could require the deployment of American troops or enable Ukraine to engage in offensive operations beyond its borders.  F-16s and long-range missiles should therefore be off the table. These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States into the conflict and drawing us closer to a hot war between the world's two largest nuclear powers. That risk is unacceptable.\"\n\nDeSantis also understands that the establishment's false narratives of \"defending democracy\" and fairytales of regime change are intended to distract from our domestic woes: \"We cannot prioritize intervention in an escalating foreign war over the defense of our own homeland, especially as tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year from narcotics smuggled across our open border and our weapons arsenals critical for our own security are rapidly being depleted.\"\n\nDeSantis's written replies kicked the uniparty outrage machine into overdrive.\n\nOver at Bill Kristol's current doomed outlet, the Bulwark, William Saletan wrote , \"[DeSantis] has adopted a series of cynical, deceptive, anti-American talking points,\" of which he proceeds to list six. Saletan especially takes issue with DeSantis's characterization of the conflict as a \"territorial dispute,\" which, well, it is-the Donbas wants to become part of Russia, and the Ukrainians don't want to give it up. \"This is rubbish. The war is an unprovoked invasion and occupation of Ukraine,\" Saletan said, just days before the twentieth anniversary of Iraq.\n\nNational Review editor Ramesh Ponnuru also took issue with DeSantis's characterization of the conflict as a \"territorial dispute\" in his column for the Washington Post . Such a phrase \"euphemizes Vladimir Putin's quest to destroy a nation,\" Ponnuru said, though in rhetoric and strategy, it is clear Putin does not have such ambitions.\n\n\"DeSantis implied that he might be willing to exert pressure on Ukraine to settle with Russia,\" Ponnuru said, adding that \"at no point did DeSantis either express the hope that Ukraine would prevail or offer sympathy for its people.\"\n\nPonnuru deserves credit for giving restraint-oriented realists a somewhat-fair shake, hinting that \"accusations of repeating 1938\" is just another silly example of Godwin's law. He nevertheless ends his piece saying, \"Ukraine's resistance to Russian aggression deserves continued U.S. support, but that support could use more realism.\"\n\nFinally, the Wall Street Journal editorial board called DeSantis's comments his \"First Big Mistake.\" \"He may regret describing the war in Ukraine as a mere 'territorial dispute,'\" the board wrote. Is this conjecture or a threat? \"This is flirting with GOP isolationism that has emerged from time to time in history,\" they add.\n\nThis history they speak of? The 1930s, of course. The history they forget? The 1910s.\n\nThe piece trundles on, reminding DeSantis of Ronald Reagan's \"evil empire\" speech and \"peace through strength\" maxim. The Journal's editorial board almost makes one regret that Reagan ever uttered those words.\n\nThe establishment's pearl-clutching and moralizing over DeSantis's comments is about more than just the war in Ukraine. It's a pressure campaign designed to force DeSantis into choosing the political elite class over the voting public.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "Donald Trump should get Agrippa.\n\nThe first Roman emperor, Octavian Caesar Augustus, was a talented military recruiter and a canny politician. He was not a terribly good general. At the Battle of Philippi, the final stand of Julius Caesar's killers, Mark Antony oversaw most of the operations; at the Battle of Actium, Mark Antony's own occasion of demise, the action was mostly guided by Octavian's friend, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.\n\nAgrippa is one of history's ciphers. His origins are obscure; the family name \"Vipsanius\" is highly unusual, probably from one of the forgotten languages of the Boot's mountainous and only recently Romanized interior. He was an unprepossessing man-thick-necked and heavy-browed, irascible, so averse to public appearance that he refused military triumphs three times. He also was the indispensable pillar of Augustus' new state, and came to share only a hairbreadth's less formal power than Caesar himself. He is little remembered today-a name on the Pantheon for bored tourists to wonder about vaguely.\n\nNot everyone is a showman or a prophet; nor is everyone a general or an administrator. Every politician should look in the mirror and make an honest evaluation: Am I an Augustus or an Agrippa? To the patriot, to be either is its own reward.\n\nThat brings us to the erstwhile presidential candidate, Florida's Gov. Ron DeSantis, and his future.\n\nIt is universally agreed that DeSantis's governorate has been a model for conservative action. Florida is prosperous and growing; its crime rate is low; DeSantis has taken on sinister corporate interests , progressive prosecutors, and obstructionist administrators with aplomb and efficiency.\n\nIt is also universally agreed that DeSantis is not a national-level retail politician. His neutral face is a scowl, he has the off-putting habits of licking his lips and grinding his teeth when he isn't speaking, his canned lines sound canned, his improvised lines sound weird, and he talks through his nose. It was clear that he would never be able to hold a candle to the ever-telegenic Donald Trump, even setting aside the former president's functional incumbent status and cadres of hard-core political followers. A poor media approach-reminiscent of the failed Mastriano senate campaign's fortress strategy-and constant organizational chaos sealed the deal. A candidate can overcome all this on friendly territory ( as Florida is ), but America as a whole doesn't owe you anything and isn't going to act like it- and didn't .\n\nEffective but unlovely. DeSantis is an Agrippa. It would be folly and a great shame to leave him unused in a Trump cabinet.\n\nThe position of attorney general is a natural fit for a man of DeSantis's talents and training. The Department of Justice has been transformed into a political police . DeSantis, himself a former prosecutor and legal counsel for the Navy, will be well-positioned to set department policy and purge political agitators from the personnel rolls.\n\nSimilarly, the State Department, the historical enemy of right-populist presidents, would stand to benefit from DeSantis's unsmiling attentions. Our diplomatic establishment is set on exporting the most radical, unpopular portions of our national culture to unwilling recipients ; department funds are used to encourage lawlessness abroad. That's just the surface; there is more than enough material at the Harry S Truman Building to keep our man busy for four years. The point of caution with an appointment to State is the Floridian's foreign policy alignment, which remains a question mark even after a year of campaigning.\n\nWhich brings us to two other plausible prospects for a DeSantis appointment that seem of more dubious benefit to the country-the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. While it seems unlikely that DeSantis would tolerate the ongoing cultural revolution in our armed forces, it seems far from certain that he is very interested in curbing the onward bloody career of the American war machine. Similarly, it does not seem like a sure thing that a former legal advisor at Guantanamo will have many qualms about the various infamies of our national security apparatus . Best not to take chances.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that the conservatives' bench is shallower than the liberal's; the broadly America First-aligned bench is shallower still. It is unlikely that DeSantis will have much success in any future national election, and Florida's two senators are relatively young and vigorous conservative Republicans. A cabinet post is the natural use for him, and also his best chance at continuing to climb the greasy pole.\n\nFor his part, Trump has been relatively graceful since DeSantis dropped out of the race. Why shouldn't he be? He's an Augustus. (And he has bigger fish to fry after Nikki Haley's surprisingly close Tuesday performance in New Hampshire.) DeSantis has endorsed 45, but appears to be gauging his involvement in a campaign that he raised legitimate reservations about in a Tuesday radio appearance. For the sake of the country, let's hope he skips the sour grapes and decides to embrace the Vipsanian mindset.\n\nJude Russo is the managing editor of The American Conservative and a contributing editor of The New York Sun .

      "text": "This is a pretty good story from Vox's Zack Beauchamp, about how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is kind of Viktor-Orbanny. Of course Beauchamp means it to tarnish DeSantis. For me, as an Orban fan, it makes me excited about a DeSantis presidential candidacy. For those American conservatives who have bought the media line critical of Viktor Orban, you should read the Beauchamp piece and understand that if you like what Ron DeSantis is doing, you ought to take a look at how Viktor Orban runs Hungary. Excerpts:\n\nIn June of last year, Hungary's far-right government passed a law cracking down on LGBTQ rights, including a provision prohibiting instruction on LGBTQ topics in sex education classes .\n\nAbout nine months later, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" bill banning \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity\" up through third grade. According to some knowledgeable observers on the right, these two bills were closely connected.\n\n\"About the Don't Say Gay law, it was in fact modeled in part on what Hungary did last summer,\" Rod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative magazine, said during a panel interview in Budapest . \"I was told this by a conservative reporter who ... said he talked to the press secretary of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and she said, 'Oh yeah, we were watching the Hungarians, so yay Hungary.'\"\n\n(When I asked DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw about a possible connection, she initially denied knowing of Hungarian inspiration for Florida's law. After I showed her the quote from Dreher, she did not respond further. Dreher did not reply to two requests for comment.)\n\nIt's easy to see the connections between the bills - in both provisions and justifications. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán described his country's anti-LGBTQ law as an effort to prevent gay people from preying on children ; Pushaw described Florida's law as an \"anti-grooming bill\" on Twitter, adding that \"if you're against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer\" - meaning a person preparing children to become targets of sexual abuse, a slur targeting LGBTQ people and their supporters that's becoming increasingly common on the right .\n\nThis is not a one-off example. DeSantis, who has built a profile as a pugilistic culture warrior with eyes on the presidency, has steadily put together a policy agenda with strong echoes of Orbán's governing ethos - one in which an allegedly existential cultural threat from the left justifies aggressive uses of state power against the right's enemies.\n\nMost recently, there was DeSantis's crackdown on Disney's special tax exemption; using regulatory powers to punish opposing political speech is one of Orbán's signature moves . On issues ranging from higher education to social media to gerrymandering , DeSantis has followed a trail blazed by Orbán, turning policy into a tool for targeting outgroups while entrenching his party's hold on power.\n\nLet me draw a fine point on this. Vox is written by and for liberals and progressives. It is obvious to them, of course, that linking Orban and DeSantis is a blow to DeSantis. But to my eyes, it goes to show that the thing that I began saying last summer when I first went to Budapest - that American conservatives have a lot to learn from Orban's politics - may finally be starting to happen.\n\nMore Vox:\n\nOrbán's political model has frequently employed a demagogic two-step : Stand up a feared or marginalized group as an enemy then use the supposed need to combat this group's influence to justify punitive policies that also happen to expand his regime's power. Targets have included Muslim immigrants, Jewish financier George Soros, and most recently LGBTQ Hungarians. Hungary's version of the \"Don't Say Gay\" law - which the government labeled an anti-pedophilia bill - expanded both government control over curricula and its powers to regulate programming on Hungary's airwaves.\n\nYou see a similar logic in DeSantis's Florida. Alleging that classroom education on LGBTQ topics somehow threatens children, the governor and his allies pushed through a vague and broadly worded bill that empowers both the state and private citizens to go after schools that teach about LGBTQ identity. A moral panic about alleged LGBTQ \"grooming\" serves to justify the imposition of ideological controls on public education - and the speech rights of progressive and LGBTQ teachers. (Relatedly, both Orbán and DeSantis have taken aim at curricula and textbooks used in K-12 schools on expressly political-cultural grounds.)\n\nYou see the dishonesty here. Gosh, y'all, we're only educating children about LGBTQ topics. That's like handing little children a copy of Playboy and saying you're only educating them about human anatomy. To DeSantis's credit, he sees through this liberal gaslighting - unlike so many other Republican politicians, who quiver at the thought of being called a bigot, such that they lack the stones to stand up for common-sense legislation.\n\nAnd notice Beauchamp's \"feared or marginalized\" groups and figures. Standard, boring liberal analysis, in which groups declared to be \"marginalized\" are assumed to be sacrosanct. Why did Orban not want to let Muslim migrants into Hungary in 2015? Because he judged that they would not assimilate well (especially given Hungary's very difficult language), and would end up being hugely problematic - as unassimilable Muslim immigrants in other European countries have been. (Curiously, I overheard a conversation among conservatives in the Netherlands this week talking about how North African Muslim immigrants have brought endless troubles to the Netherlands, but Turkish and Iranian Muslims have assimilated fairly well.) For Western liberals, migrants can never be bad or problematic ; therefore, opposing them coming into your country can only ever be an act of bigotry.\n\nSimilarly with \"Jewish financier George Soros\". Beauchamp means to smear Orban as anti-Semitic - an ugly canard that can easily be disproven by spending time in Budapest. The Orban government lavishly funds Jewish cultural organizations. It is closely allied with Israel. What Orban hates about Soros is that Soros is a liberal globalist billionaire who uses his fortune to try to change Hungary (Soros's homeland) in progressive ways. Libs love billionaire oligarch types if they can be counted on to push progressive policies. And Western journalists are so knee-jerk in their analyses - it's all identity politics with them - that they can't recognize that by attacking Soros, Viktor Orban is playing class politics, not ethnic politics.\n\nSimilarly about LGBT, to the liberal mind, there are no limits on how far queerness can be taken. To object to any of it is to show yourself to be a bigot. You may believe that the Hungarian law went too far, but only a parochial cosmopolitan can believe that the only reason people wouldn't want their children propagandized to embrace transgressive sexual and gender roles is plain bigotry. Orban's media law was popular with Hungarians, just as DeSantis's far softer education law is popular with Floridians (and not just Floridians).\n\nMore Beauchamp:\n\nPredictably , the Florida bill provoked a backlash from corporate America - which DeSantis used as a justification to engage in even more Orbán-like behavior.\n\nAfter Disney put out a statement criticizing the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, DeSantis moved to strip the corporation of its special tax status in a 40-square-mile area around Disney World. In this area, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, Florida allows the mega-corporation to essentially function as a local government, giving it the power to, for example, collect taxes (from itself) and build roads. These privileges, first granted by the state in 1967, are hugely beneficial for the company - and, on Friday, DeSantis signed a bill revoking them .\n\nIn doing so, he was very explicit about his reasoning: This move was direct punishment for Disney's stance on the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. In a fundraising email, DeSantis wrote that \"Disney and other woke corporations won't get away with peddling their unchecked pressure campaigns any longer .\" In an appearance on Newsmax , Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez noted that Disney had \"changed what they really espouse,\" lambasting the company's \"very public agenda to indoctrinate our children.\"\n\nYep, and bless DeSantis and Nunez for doing a very un-Republican thing, and blasting Big Business. DeSantis seems to be learning the Orban lesson that the state should be used at times to rein business in. Conservatives like me (remember Crunchy Cons from 2006?) have been saying for a long time that corporate America has too much power, and doesn't use it for the common good. I'm not a statist, but there's nothing wrong with a balance of powers in our society. Now that we are afflicted with Woke Capitalism, Ron DeSantis understands that the only way we will ever cause these extremely rich, extremely powerful, extremely progressive corporations to back off is to use the power of the state to punish them.\n\nOverall, regarding Orban, I find it fascinating to watch the Left's obsession with him and the way he uses power. It reveals at times that left-wing figures simply assume that large areas of public and private institutional life belongs to them, and should not be contested. In the Netherlands this week, I heard a conservative academic talk about how every cultural institution in his country is totally owned by the Left, and generously subsidized by the taxpayer, through the state. This is common throughout the US and Europe; liberals think it's simply the natural order of things. Viktor Orban contests that - and he wins, and he keeps winning.\n\nAfter a conservative dinner in the Netherlands, I overheard one man present say that if he didn't have a good job that kept him busy, \"I would go to Budapest.\" It's where things are happening now on the intellectual Right. It's where the future is being argued over, and worked out. I'm on my way home from Budapest now,  but I'm going to get back as soon as I can.\n\nMaybe Florida is becoming our American Hungary. I was having drinks this week with a prominent US intellectual conservative, who told me that so many important conservatives have moved to Florida in the last couple of years that things are really starting to happen there. He lives in the DC area, and said he has never really had to go to Florida before. But now that's changing.

It helped that he followed a dull but half-hysterical rant by Sen. Rick Scott, who fired a barrage of Republican cliches at the audience ( watch it here ). A conservative writer friend sitting across the room texted me during the speech to joke that this thing was so bad it's causing him to rethink all his convictions.\n\nAnd then came DeSantis. His talk was workmanlike, but extremely effective, because he spoke plainly, talking about things he has actually done as Florida governor to advance conservative goals. I realize that sounds dull, but I assure you that for we who were in the room, it was anything but. After being bum-rushed by Rick Scott, it was great to be spoken to by a politician who addressed us as if we were real people.\n\nHe began by talking about why he did not defer to experts during Covid -- and why that worked out well for him. A statesman's job is not to automatically defer to expert opinion, DeSantis said, but to hear from a number of people around an issue, and to find a way to harmonize what they're saying. It was refreshing to hear a leader question the cult of expertise.\n\nI wanted to stand up and cheer when DeSantis talked about how conservatives have got to get over their reflex to defer to Big Business. He spoke about how he believes that when Big Business is oppressing individuals, the state should come to their aid. He also lashed out at Republicans who sit back and allow bad things to happen because they are too listless or afraid to take a tough stand.\n\n\"Use the power you have!\" he said. \"I'm sick of the press releases. I'm sick of the interviews\" -- meaning GOP pols who talk big but who don't follow through.\n\nDeSantis briefly mentioned the Stop WOKE Act, which bans most DEI training in businesses of over 15 employees, and which has been partially blocked by a federal judge. He said, of employers, \"They can't force you to affirm beliefs that you don't have.\" One of the biggest applause lines of the night came after he talked about what he did to slap Disney back into its lane when the woke corporation tried to strongarm the state into allowing gay activists and allies to present gender ideology to little schoolchildren.\n\nFor me, the best part of DeSantis's long speech was how he kept coming back to how the GOP has to take on Big Business on behalf of the little guy. This is Reagan-era Republican heresy -- but he's 100 percent correct. \"Too many Republicans view 'limited government' as 'whatever Big Business wants',\" DeSantis said. Capitalism is vital, he said, but it is a means to creating a Good Society; it is not an end in itself. Best line of the night: \"The United States is a country that has an economy, not the other way around.\"\n\nThe governor tore into Big Tech, saying, \"We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are doing the Regime's bidding when it comes to censorship.\" And: \"They are de facto the enforcement arm of Regime ideology.\" This section of DeSantis's speech was so interesting. I've embedded video of the entire talk below, but if you don't have time to watch it, click on this link, which will take you to the passage near the end in which he discusses how so many institutions in American life have been captured by the Woke, and how he is unafraid to use the power of the state to push back against corporate and cultural monopolies that push the little guy around.\n\n\"Can we act to prevent our citizens from getting crushed by these major monopolies?\" he asked. \"They have an enormous amount of power over society. And so when people say oh, you're using government in the private sector, what I'm doing is using government to give space to the individual citizen to be able to be able to participate in society, to be able to speak his or her mind. I think that's absolutely an appropriate use of government power.  ...To sit back and just do nothing while a bunch of Silicon Valley oligarchs are imposing an orthodoxy on this country, which views all of us as second-class citizens? No thank you, I'm not signing up for that.\"\n\nDeSantis laid in to the administrative state, saying it has been weaponized to serve the Left's goals -- and Congress has allowed it to happen. He used this as an example of how the Left advances its goals through democratically unaccountable institutions.\n\n\"So many of these institutions have been captured by a failed, ossified ruling class,\" he said. \"If you want to have an American revival, yes, it requires electing good people, having good policy. But it also requires a recognition that it's not just in the electoral realm, it's also in the administrative realm, and more and more in the corporate and technological realm. I think the Left is playing for keeps.\"\n\nDeSantis is not a great public speaker -- he talks in prose, not poetry -- but what he said was galvanizing. Besides, his actions as governor speak louder than the empty words of other Republican politicians. Talking with conference attendees about the DeSantis speech, I found near-unanimous sentiment that DeSantis should be the 2024 GOP nominee -- but also near-unanimous belief that he could not beat Donald Trump in a primary match-up. The feeling is that Trump simply has too great a hold on too many GOP primary voters.\n\nI find this incredibly frustrating. Ron DeSantis sounded many Trumpian populist themes, and has demonstrated in office his ability to use the power of state to make things happen. He knows how to govern in a common sense way, and has proved it. And it's not all about him. If DeSantis is the 2024 GOP presidential nominee, we will have a great national argument about issues. If Trump is the nominee, we will have a great national argument about Trump.\n\nWhether or not DeSantis runs for president in this next cycle, we saw and heard in DeSantis's speech where the future of the GOP is: with common-sense populism. That is, with standing up for the little guy against elites and the institutions they run, both public and private -- and not just standing up rhetorically, but with legislative and policy action. Did you ever imagine that you would hear a major Republican politician say a line like, \"America is a country with an economy, not the other way around\"? I didn't. It's true, and it's welcome. Whether it's 2024 or 2028, Ron DeSantis is the future of political conservatism in America.

      "text": "DeSantis warns Florida city to  'govern yourselves accordingly' after refusing agreement with ICE\n\n'Florida will ensure its laws are followed.'\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis (R) released a statement after Fort Myers' city council voted against an agreement to have the police department work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying there is new state law that requires cooperation with the federal government.\n\nThe agreement would have allowed ICE to train local law enforcement officers to carry out federal immigration duties while they are carrying out their regular duties. The city council voted 3-3, resulting in the agreement not being adopted. One council member was not present. The Fort Myers police chief spoke in favor of the  287(g) agreement, while residents who spoke did not.\n\n'These council members['] actions likely run afoul of Florida Statute, and my office will be investigating.'\n\n\"Thanks to the laws we've recently enacted in Florida, local entities are required to participate in federal immigration enforcement. The 287 (g) program trains local law enforcement to aid ICE. Florida will ensure its laws are followed, and when it comes to immigration - the days of inaction are over. Govern yourselves accordingly,\" DeSantis said on X.\n\nAttorney General James Uthmeier likewise expressed frustration with the city for not agreeing to help ICE, adding that his office will conduct an investigation.\n\n\"The Fort Myers City Council's vote to not approve the police department's 287(g) agreement with ICE is very troubling. Preventing a local law enforcement agency from entering into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government prevents that agency from participating in certain federal immigration operations,\" Uthmeier said . \"These council members['] actions likely run afoul of Florida Statute, and my office will be investigating.\"\n\nThe new laws recently passed by the state legislature were part of DeSantis' goal to have Florida be the number-one state in utilizing state and local police departments to help the Trump administration carry out mass deportations.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds (R), who represents the Fort Myers area and is running to be the next governor, also criticized the city council for its \"atrocious disregard for the safety and security of our Southwest Florida community,\" claiming the decision not to pass the agreement should be \"roundly condemned.\"\n\n\"We are putting the American people first again and every council-member who voted to flagrantly violate federal and state law should lose their job.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says he'll wait on getting COVID-19 vaccine until elderly receive it\n\n'I am not the priority, they're the priority'\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said Wednesday that while he is willing to take one of the newly-developed vaccines for COVID-19, he believes seniors should take priority over healthy younger people - including leaders like himself.\n\nWPTV-TV reported that DeSantis made remarks during a visit to watch three senior citizens receive the Moderna vaccine at the Kings Point community in Delray Beach.\n\nOn his way out of the press conference, DeSantis was asked about whether he had been vaccinated for the coronavirus yet, to which he replied: \"What I've said is I'm willing to take it, but I'm not the priority.\" Pointing across the room, the governor said, \"They're the priority.\"\n\n\"I'm under 45,\" he explained. \"People under 45 are not going to be first in line for this, so when it's my turn I will take it, but this is who I want to be vaccinated. I want my parents, our grandparents to be able to get it.\"\n\nDeSantis said during the presser, \"You talk about a place like Kings Point, you have people from the Greatest Generation, people who fought in World War II, survived the Holocaust - these are people that we've got to stand with and prioritize.\"\n\nThe recent FDA emergency approvals of two COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. have sparked debate over who should be first to receive the inoculations for the virus that has proven to be more fatal in elderly populations.\n\nUnder the federal government's distribution, several younger members of Congress have faced criticism from colleagues for taking the jab ahead of citizens who are statistically more vulnerable to the disease. But a number of House members have held off on receiving the vaccine, voicing the same reasoning DeSantis echoed.\n\nOn one side of the debate are folks who believe elected officials should take the vaccine publicly to build the public's trust in the safety of the shots, while others say those politicians are jumping the line in front of those who need the vaccine most.\n\nAcknowledging the topic, DeSantis quipped, \"Granted I'm an elected official but whoop dee doo. At the end of the day, let's focus on where the risk is.\"\n\nFox News reported that Florida is currently experiencing long wait times for seniors who are lining up to take the vaccines that the governor's executive order from last week makes available to health care workers, nursing home residents, and anyone in the state age 65 and over.\n\n\"Supply is limited,\" DeSantis told his audience on Wednesday. He acknowledged, \"We don't have enough vaccines for all four million plus senior citizens in Florida,\" but said more doses are expected to continue to flow in.\n\nBreck Dumas"

We have no time to waste. Florida must lead,\" DeSantis said, per First Coast News .\n\n'We've got some big problems with some of the legal immigration programs.'\n\nHowever, when it comes to the ever-growing issue of foreign workers under the H-1B program, DeSantis said it was important not to mix the two issues.\n\n\"We have legal immigrants in Florida. So you can't conflate illegal immigrants with people who are here legally,\" he began.\n\n\"I've also said we've got some big problems with some of the legal immigration programs that we have,\" the governor continued before providing an example.\n\n\"We've seen this H-1B program, how companies will bring in H-1B [workers], the Americans train the H-1B [workers], and then they fire the Americans and hire the H-1B. How would that even remotely be acceptable?\"\n\nDeSantis continued his press conference by criticizing chain migration:\n\n\"You have chain migration, which is not merit-based and is bringing in this more distant relatives, not what you want. So there's a whole host of issues there that that need major reform.\"\n\nAt the same time, the governor said he had heard criticisms of immigrant farm laborers and defended them on the grounds of being legal.\n\n\"From an immigration enforcement perspective, I mean, if somebody is here on, like, an H-2A visa, they are working in the state of Florida legally. And when we did E-Verify, people would say, ... 'Hey. There's a a busload of farm workers. I saw them on I-4.' And people assume they're illegal.\"\n\nDeSantis' comments largely defended the work of the Trump administration on illegal immigration and Trump's upcoming deportation plan. The governor even threatened to suspend elected officials from office in Florida if they are found to be \"neglecting their duties\" and causing roadblocks for the new immigration mandates.\n\n\"It will require new legislation in Florida to ensure that the duties of both state and local officials are very clear and that those duties require them to be assisting the federal government in this regard,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis added , per the Post Millennial, \"I have the authority, with respect to certain officials, to suspend them from office if they are neglecting their duties.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Ron DeSantis RIPS Florida RINOS for misleading TRUMP Act that works against mass deportations\n\nNot that long ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis considered Donald Trump a foe when he ran against him in the presidential primaries. Today, however, he's doing everything he can to ensure Trump's agenda is advanced in Florida. That includes fighting a group of \"unbelievable RINOs\" in the Florida legislature who are resisting his intentions to support Trump's mass deportation plan.\n\nThis group has even created something called the TRUMP Act, which does the opposite of what its name suggests.\n\nYesterday, Gov. DeSantis joined Glenn Beck on \"The Glenn Beck Program\" to explain what exactly is in this misleading bill.\n\nHe first divided the states into three categories: The \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" that will attempt to \"sabotage Trump's agenda,\" the neutral states that won't help or hinder, and the states that will offer full support.\n\nIt's the latter he hopes Florida will be.\n\n\"After the election, I said this is our chance; this is the number one issue the president ran on, and we need to get it right,\" Gov. DeSantis told Glenn.\n\nUnfortunately, RINOs in the Florida legislature are working to thwart Gov. DeSantis' intentions to support ICE in carrying out deportations. Their resistance has come in the form of something called the TRUMP Act.\n\n\"They're playing this game where they think if they put Trump's name on a weak bill that somehow people will think it's going to be good, and it's totally inadequate,\" he said.\n\nThese RINOs are aiming to preserve \"cheap illegal alien labor\" that is sought after in certain industries and remove \"immigration enforcement authority from the governor\" and place it in the hands of the \"Commissioner of Agriculture.\"\n\n\"That's like the fox guarding the hen house,\" DeSantis analogized.\n\nFurther, under this proposal, \"illegals can register [to vote] in Florida\" without having to sign an affidavit alleging that they're U.S. citizens, which violates Florida's constitution.\n\n\"We have in our proposals a rebuttable presumption that illegals that get brought up on criminal charges are detained and then turned over to ICE,\" but this group of resistors \"watered that down so that judges are just going to release these guys back on the street,\" he explained.\n\nThese Republicans, DeSantis reminded, \"all ran on bashing Biden's border policies,\" and argued that Florida needed \"to get tough supporting Donald Trump's agenda in 2024.\"\n\nNow they're \"bragging\" about purchasing \"beds for illegals,\" he said. \"I don't want to house the illegals, I want to deport the illegals.\"\n\nThe constituents of these Congress members are unhappy as well.\n\n\"I've never seen our base react more negatively on an issue than what the legislature is trying to pull right now. It is like 99 to 1 in terms of opposition,\" said DeSantis.\n\nIf the voters' displeasure wasn't evidence enough that the TRUMP Act is garbage, \"Democrats in the Florida Senate were high-fiving them; liberal media in Florida have been singing their praises; the ACLU of Florida tweeted thank you for what you're doing.\"\n\nTo hear more about the TRUMP Act and how Gov. DeSantis plans to fight it, watch the clip above.\n\nTo enjoy more of Glenn's masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV - the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\n\nBlazeTV Staff"

      "text": "DeSantis delivers a governor's masterclass in governance\n\nFloridians, and thousands of people seeking shelter there from other states, know the Sunshine State will remain a beacon for ordered liberty while chaos and mob rule reign elsewhere.\n\nAs they search for a winning campaign message this election, Republicans are consumed with turmoil over abortion. Bizarrely, as they move leftward on the issue and engage in mental gyrations to subvert a longstanding conservative stance, Republicans are all ignoring the lesson of Ron DeSantis and Florida: You do not need to sell out your values to win elections.\n\nDeSantis won over many pro-choice voters in 2022, carrying the female vote by seven points (white women in particular by 18 points) and the suburban vote by 18 points, even as 56% of Florida voters said abortion should be legal. Now, the state is poised to give Donald Trump the widest margin in modern presidential elections, despite the passage of the heartbeat bill. What gives?\n\nWhen you lead and govern with prudence, principle, and competence, every issue winds up being a winning issue.\n\nWhile not all swing voters agree with DeSantis and Florida Republicans on abortion, they appreciate his \"whole life\" approach, making the quality of life in Florida - from safety and security to cleanliness and economic prosperity - superb.\n\nAccording to a new Emerson poll , 57% of Florida voters believe the six-week ban on abortion is \"too strict.\" At the same time, Trump maintains a 13-point lead over Joe Biden in the Sunshine State, even as the same pollster has Biden leading by two points nationally. Hence, even as the national poll has Trump performing along the lines of his 2020 loss, it shows him winning a historic margin in Florida after carrying the state by just 3.36 percentage points four years ago.\n\nClearly, one can govern strongly in favor of life so long as he has a broader message and list of accomplishments on comprehensive quality-of-life issues.\n\nElections are not about issues in a vacuum (aside from individual ballot referenda). Elections hinge upon the amalgamation of the image, messaging, and accomplishments of the candidate and the broader party.\n\nImagine if the broader GOP had the accomplishments of DeSantis, particularly on core quality-of-life issues?\n\nRather than receding to irrelevance after failing to win the presidential primary, DeSantis stepped up his fight for the freedom and security of Floridians every day since exiting the race. He accomplishes more in one week than other GOP governors do during their entire tenure.\n\nIf the rest of America is government by anarcho-tyranny, Florida has now become a beacon of ordered liberty - freedom and prosperity for peaceful citizens with zero tolerance for criminals and anarchists.\n\nSuburban voters, regardless of their position on abortion, care about their quality of life. Everyone wants safety and security. While the rest of the country is degenerating into ubiquitous crime, carjackings, theft, and street vagrancy, Florida is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nAddressing the trend we see in blue cities where anarchist mobs attack and harass law enforcement, DeSantis signed SB 184 , making it a crime to harass law enforcement and first responders. He also signed HB 601, which guts the Soros-inspired \"civilian oversight boards\" blue city governments established to second-guess every officer-involved shooting.\n\nAlthough every Republican claims to be pro-law enforcement, most others have not leaned on blue city officials to fight the anarchy. Red Texas is full of anti-cop blue cities. In Florida, by contrast, crime is at a 50-year low, and thousands of police officers are moving to the state and even receiving bonuses.\n\nFloridians, and hundreds of thousands of people seeking shelter there from other states, know that the Sunshine State will remain a beacon for ordered liberty while chaos and mob rule reign elsewhere.\n\nGiven crime and political instability in Haiti, there was a broad expectation that thousands of Haitian refugees would throng Florida's shores as we saw with the Cuban Mariel boat lift in 1980. Much to the shock of those who don't know DeSantis, nobody has come so far . DeSantis' stern warning about interior enforcement and his forward deployment of maritime assets have clearly deterred an invasion.\n\nThe same principle holds for domestic unrest. Pro-Hamas protesters shut down major bridges and highways across the nation this week - except in Miami, where police had zero tolerance for road blocking. The police knew they had a mandate and weren't afraid to use it.\n\nDeSantis also decided to crack down on street violence during spring break this year. In line with his ruthless efficiency in deploying law enforcement, this is the first year without widespread violence and no viral videos of wild street fights.\n\nOf course, there is the issue of porch piracy and shoplifting that is plaguing even red states. Florida became the first state to clamp down on flash mobs and made porch piracy a felony . Suburban voters like their packages to be delivered and stay on their porches.\n\nThese are not sexy national issues, but they matter to voters.\n\nWhile ensuring public safety, DeSantis has consistently cut the budget, accrued record surpluses, paid off a quarter of the state's existing debt, slashed tolls, and cut sales taxes on baby items. Florida has the lowest per capita state government overhead in the nation.\n\nFlorida also has more housing inventory by far than any other state, has had a substantially lower unemployment rate than the national average for 41 consecutive months, and is the number-one state for new business formation.\n\nAdditionally, DeSantis has enacted a host of educational reforms , broke the back of teachers' unions, and fought to purge wokeness from K-12 schools and state universities.\n\nEven on issues that don't make headlines, such as the complicated problem of homeowner's insurance, DeSantis' reforms are paying off. Seven more insurance companies have entered the market, and several of them are announcing a plan to extend relief to policyholders.\n\nTaken together, the entire political center of suburban voters in the state feels like it has a governor who cares about quality of life and is competent in enriching it. Some of those voters might disagree with the governor on this or that ideological issue. But he has been able to lean into those issues precisely because he offers a full package - whole life - tethered to a strong pro-life message on abortion.\n\nThat's likely why Florida Republicans now hold a massive enthusiasm advantage over Democrats and independents. This stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the nation where a reverse enthusiasm gap is fueling Democrats' victories in special elections.\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

Ron DeSantis weighed in on the current Middle East conflict between Israelis and Palestinians . The Republican governor blasted Hamas , placing blame on the group for the recent bloodshed in the tumultuous region, and emphasized that Israelis have the \"right to defend themselves.\"\n\n\"I also wanted to just make a comment about what's happening in the Middle East,\" DeSantis said during a Wednesday press conference. \"I have friends over there who have been having to hide out in bomb shelters overnight, because of Hamas, which is a terrorist group, raining down rockets on civilians.\"\n\n\"And make no mistake, Hamas is a terrorist group,\" DeSantis proclaimed. \"They are at fault on this. Israel has every right to defend itself against Hamas. And I think if you look at what's going on here, it really isn't so much about Israel, it's about Hamas trying to stake a claim to be the leader of the entire Palestinian Authority.\"\n\n\"They kind of have their little place down in Gaza where they foment a lot of terrorism,\" DeSantis explained. \"They've had a lot of problems going on with the Palestinian Authority. I think this is Hamas' attempt to capitalize on that. But our ally Israel has a right to defend themselves and what's going on by Hamas is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nThe Florida governor delivered his remarks about the violent situation on the other side of the world as speculation grows that DeSantis could be eyeing up a run for president in 2024. A new poll from the Trafalgar Group found that DeSantis is far and away the most popular Republican presidential candidate if Donald Trump decides not to run in 2024. The nationwide survey, conducted between April 30 and May 6, discovered that DeSantis currently gets almost 35% support from likely GOP voters in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, which is nearly the same amount as the next three potential candidates combined - Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, and Mike Pence.\n\nAn Echelon Insights poll from April declared DeSantis to be the early leader with 20% of the vote if Trump doesn't run for president. A Just the News survey from late February stated that DeSantis was the leading Republican 2024 candidate if former President Donald Trump sits out 2024, with 21% of the vote. During the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Republicans overwhelmingly supported DeSantis in the 2024 election, with 43% supporting his presidential run if Trump bows out.\n\nMore than 1,500 rockets have been launched from Gaza toward Israel since Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. There are a reported 83 deaths in Gaza and seven in Israel, according to the BBC . Four senior Hamas commanders and a dozen more Hamas operatives were killed by Israeli airstrikes, the Guardian reported.\n\nViolence erupted in the streets of Israel late Wednesday as Arab and Jewish mobs attacked each other. Following the night of \"anarchy,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"nothing justifies\" the street violence and vowed to restore order \"with an iron fist if necessary.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me that your blood is boiling,\" Netanyahu said . \"You can't take the law in your hands.\"\n\nIsrael has prepared combat troops along the Gaza border and is in \"various stages of preparing ground operations,\" a military spokesman said on Thursday.\n\n\"The chief of staff is inspecting those preparations and providing guidance,\" said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesperson of the IDF.\n\nHamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida responded to Israel's troop buildup with a threat.\n\n\"Mass up as you wish, from the sea, land and sky. We have prepared for your kinds of deaths that would make you curse yourselves,\" Ubaida proclaimed .\n\nPaul Sacca"

Ron DeSantis orders National Guard to end longshoremen's strike over hurricane disaster\n\nHe also hammered the Biden-Harris administration for allowing the strike to hurt Americans recovering from a disaster.\n\nRepublican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his order to send the National Guard to end a damaging union strike at ports on the Gulf Coast.\n\n'It is unacceptable for the Biden-Harris administration to allow supply chain interruptions to hurt people.'\n\nDeSantis made the announcement on Thursday, only two days after the International Longshoremen's Association began a strike meant to pressure the United States Maritime Alliance into bending to the union's demands.\n\n\"At my direction, the Florida National Guard and the Florida State Guard will be deployed to critical ports affected by the strike to maintain order and, where possible, resume operations,\" he said to reporters Thursday from Manatee County.\n\n\"It is unacceptable for the Biden-Harris administration to allow supply chain interruptions to hurt people who are reeling from a category 4 hurricane,\" he added.\n\nHe went on to announce various other emergency measures meant to aid disaster relief efforts in the wake of the massive damage from Hurricane Helene. He also said that there have been 15 confirmed fatalities in the state of Florida but that he expects the actual number of fatalities to climb much higher.\n\nThe union represents more than 40,000 workers at ports on the East Coast and the Gulf Coast. The ILA union is demanding a steep pay raise and also a ban on automation that would make ports far more efficient but may decrease demand for dockworkers.\n\nCritics of the strike have accused the union of using force and damaging the economy in order to stand in the way of progress and efficiency.\n\nThe president, however, issued a statement blaming the greed of the shipping industry.\n\n\"As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the resources they need,\" said President Joe Biden (D). \"Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump signaled that he also sided with the dockworkers.\n\n\"American workers should be able to negotiate for better wages, especially since the shipping companies are mostly foreign-flag vessels,\" he said.\n\nVideo of the governor's address can be viewed on the news report from WTSP-TV on YouTube.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "DeSantis takes command as Florida braces for another destructive hurricane\n\n'You'll have over 30,000 linemen that'll be stationed.'\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Driving to Florida's capital from Jacksonville on Interstate 10, you'll notice the large, fallen tree branches and tree trunks still lining the road. Those are the reminders of Hurricane Helene, which passed through the region a little under two weeks ago, and already the state is bracing for another hurricane that can make Helene look like a walk in the park.\n\nHurricane Milton has been described as a once-in-a-lifetime hurricane because of how it formed in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico and how fast it developed into a Category 5 storm. While it is still too early to say definitely where Milton will make landfall later this week, many models are predicting it will slam directly into Tampa Bay, which hasn't taken a direct hit since 1921.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R) and his administration are back working in emergency mode, barely catching their breath after dealing with Helene and its aftermath. Sitting in the state's Emergency Operations Center, DeSantis assured Blaze News everyone who has been mobilized the past few weeks is ready to take on the challenges Hurricane Milton will bring.\n\n\"We've mobilized all the resources that are available to us, probably more resources than we've ever done. ... This is a major storm right now. It's strengthened beyond what anyone predicted,\" DeSantis explained.\n\nOne of the worrisome aspects of Milton is that it is projected to still be a hurricane when it moves past Florida, meaning intense winds and flooding will be seen as far away as Orlando and Jacksonville. DeSantis said those areas will not be forgotten in the cleanup.\n\n\"You'll have over 30,000 linemen that'll be stationed to be able to resume power as soon as the storm passes and it's safe to do so. We did 2.4 million [power] restorations for Hurricane Helene in record time. You potentially could have more outages on this storm and, perhaps, significantly more depending on the path that it takes as it cuts across the Florida peninsula,\" DeSantis continued. \"These guys are primed for this.\"\n\n'They were one of the first outfits to be in western North Carolina. They certainly beat the federal government there.'\n\nFor now, the state is racing against the clock before Milton arrives to remove debris in the Tampa Bay area that was caused by Helene. While state  workers have made great strides in securing the loose trash, crews have been working 24/7 to get as much of it off the streets to prevent further damage. While crews have removed tons of debris, a process which normally takes months, the area is not expected to be fully cleaned up before Milton makes landfall due to the untold tons still left and the short amount of time between Helene and Milton.\n\nIn addition to Florida's National Guard, the Florida State Guard that was reactivated under DeSantis has been tested with Helene in both Florida and North Carolina.\n\n\"They've been incredible. They've saved lives; they made a difference here in Florida. They did have a brief mission in North Carolina. ... They were one of the first outfits to be in western North Carolina. They certainly beat the federal government there. And now they're here, staging and being ready to go as needed,\" DeSantis noted.\n\nOn Tuesday, Florida officials stressed that while there is still time to evacuate out of the expected impacted areas, that window is closing. Those planning on leaving must do so by Wednesday morning. DeSantis explained while it is possible Milton can weaken down to a Category 3 storm, the state is assuming it will be much stronger when it reaches the United States.\n\nHear more on the subject from the \" Blaze News Tonight \" team in the video below:\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Florida Suspends Abortion Clinic After Hospitalizations\n\nShare This article\n\nPENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) - An abortion clinic that serves women from all over the U.S. South had its license suspended this weekend under an emergency order from Florida health officials after two women who had undergone procedures at the clinic were hospitalized this year.\n\nThe state Agency for Health Care Administration ordered the suspension of the license for American Family Planning of Pensacola, effective starting Saturday.\n\nIn cases cited by the agency, the clinic failed to monitor the patients at all times, didn't provide medical records when patients were transferred for greater care and didn't contact the patients within 24 hours after they left the clinic to assess their recovery, said the order which was issued on Friday.\n\nIt said the problems were operational deficiencies \"endangering the health, safety and welfare\" of the clinic's patients, and the clinic failed to submit timely reports about the incidents to the state agency.\n\nIn one case, clinic workers urged the husband of a patient to take her to a hospital in Mobile, Alabama, rather than a closer hospital in Pensacola that had a transfer agreement with the clinic, delaying her treatment. At the Alabama hospital, the woman needed to be resuscitated and required a transfusion to replace blood loss, according to the emergency order.\n\nIn another case from March, a patient was taken to the emergency room of a Pensacola hospital with bleeding and low blood pressure. She needed emergency surgery and a surgeon performed a hysterectomy. Last year, a third patient required a uterine perforation repair, according to the emergency order.\n\n\"Women receiving abortions must receive the level of care and services mandated by law,\" the emergency order said.\n\nThe clinic is entitled to a hearing about the decision.\n\nA woman who says she works for the clinic's scheduling service answered the phone on Sunday but said nobody was there who could talk about the emergency order.\n\nBecause of its historically less restrictive laws, Florida has long been considered a \"safe haven\" for women from neighboring states wanting to get abortions. On its website, the clinic says it serves women from Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia.\n\nEven though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last month legislation that would ban most abortions after 15 weeks, Florida's abortion law is still likely to be less restrictive than those of neighboring states should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCopyright 2022. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nShare This article\n\nYou are signing up to receive general newsletters from CBN.

      "text": "Donald Trump Jr. makes stunning move against Ron DeSantis and wife Casey\n\nBy STEPHEN M. LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 21:06 EDT, 12 March 2025 | Updated: 02:01 EDT, 13 March 2025\n\n141\n\nView comments\n\nDonald Trump Jr. followed in his father's footsteps , endorsing Congressman Byron Donalds for governor of Florida in a stunning move against Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey.\n\nThe 46-year-old Donalds, who has served in Congress since 2021, has quickly become a favorite of the MAGA movement.\n\nHowever, current Governor DeSantis has talked up First Lady Casey for governor amid chatter about her planning to launch her own bid after having served as Florida's first lady.\n\nTrump's oldest son continued the family's move away from DeSantis with a full-throated endorsement of his wife's chief potential rival.\n\n'My friend Byron Donalds is a great patriot and has my full endorsement to serve as Florida's next governor,' Trump Jr. said in a statement.\n\n'Byron is a fighter and a true champion for our America First movement. He will be a great leader for Florida and he will fight alongside my father to make America greater than ever before!'\n\nDon Jr ., much like the rest of the Trump family, split with DeSantis when the governor challenged his father for the Republican nomination in 2024.\n\nHe mocked a video of DeSantis having his make-up re-applied at a GOP presidential debate.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. followed in his father's footsteps , endorsing Congressman Byron Donalds for governor of Florida in a move against Ron DeSantis and his wife Casey\n\nCurrent governor DeSantis has talked up his wife Casey for governor amid chatter about her planning to launch her own bid after having served as Florida's first lady\n\nThe former president's son posted the clip of the Florida Governor getting a touch up, with the caption: 'Rhonda Santis,' followed by laughing emojis.\n\nAhead of the Iowa caucuses, he took particular issues with DeSantis' 2024 bid , slamming his father's competitor for his footwear choice and his loss of 'billionaire donors.'\n\n'Who thinks it's acceptable for men to be wearing high heels while running for the Republican nomination? Anyone?' the eldest Trump son questioned, to which the audience replied: 'NO!'\n\n'And here's the thing - no one cares if he's short. No one cares. No one cares if you're short,' he continued. 'You know what they care about - that you're so insecure about it that you have to overcompensate.'\n\n'That's the kind of stuff that gets us into wars, right? It's that kind of insecurity that you do get pushed into doing stuff that's probably not right for the will of the people,' Don Jr. said. 'And that's what we see from so many of the RINOS in Washington, D.C. right now.'\n\nNow, he appears set to go back to war with DeSantis over Donalds' candidacy for governor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed the congressman in a social media post in late February.\n\n'I am hearing that Highly Respected Congressman Byron Donalds is considering running for Governor of Florida, a State that I love, and WON BIG in 2016, 2020, and 2024,' Trump wrote on February 20.\n\nThe 46-year-old Donalds, who has served in Congress since 2021, has quickly become a favorite of the MAGA movement\n\nAhead of the Iowa caucuses, he took particular issues with DeSantis' 2024 bid , slamming his father's competitor for his footwear choice - accusing the governor of 'wearing heels' - and his loss of 'billionaire donors'\n\n'Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, BYRON, RUN!' the president added.\n\nShortly after, the congressman announced his intention to run in an interview with Sean Hannity.\n\nThough he was careful to praise Governor DeSantis for doing a 'tremendous job for our state,' he did not directly address the possibility of DeSantis' wife running.\n\nBefore Donalds even announced his run, the GOP governor who was once Trump's 2024 rival turned backer was asked about the governor's race as he is term-limited in 2026, but he declined to endorse the congressman.\n\n'My view is, is Donald Trump just got into office. I want these congressmen focused on enacting his agenda. They haven't done very much yet,' DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis played up his achievements with Republicans in his state while criticizing Donalds.\n\n'He just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left over these last years. He's just not been a part of it,' the governor said.\n\nThe governor won his reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 points, but despite bulldozing his Democratic opponent during the midterms, he was no match for Trump at the national level when he launched his 2024 presidential bid.\n\nTrump endorsed the congressman in a social media post in late February\n\nTrump and Florida congressman Donalds seen receiving their order from Downtown House of Pizza in Downtown Fort Myers in 2023\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen who will have more sway with Republicans in the state in a midterm year.\n\nDeSantis continues to talk up his wife Casey, 44, who has been a vocal supporter of his work in Florida and avid campaigner.\n\n'People ask me all the time about our wonderful first lady who has done a fantastic job as first lady of Florida,' DeSantis said.\n\nHe also repeated his recent comments that she would do even better in Florida than he did during the last gubernatorial election.\n\n'I won by the biggest margin that any Republican's ever won a governor's race here in Florida, she would do better than me, like there's no question about that, that would happen,' he said.\n\nThe governor claimed that while Republicans have had a strong showing in his state in recent election, it could change quickly.\n\n'I would not take anything for granted,' DeSantis said.\n\nThe governor said said he would be raising money even though he is not running next year and would look to 'build off the success' his party has had in Florida.\n\nDeSantis continues to talk up his wife Casey, 44, who has been a vocal supporter of his work in Florida and avid campaigner\n\nTrump often brags of having 'made' DeSantis, having endorsed him in his 2018 bid for governor\n\nDonalds who represents Florida's 19th Congressional District, which includes Fort Myers, campaigned aggressively for Trump in 2024.\n\nHe was even floated as a potential running mate.\n\nAfter Trump chose JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, there were reports Donalds was instead setting his sights on the Florida governor's race and has made that official..\n\n'For a long time, I've been in the trenches, in a lot of these battles, dealing with conservatism,' he said upon announce he would run.\n\nDonalds suggested he would prioritize lowering insurance costs, promoting the cryptocurrency industry and preserving the waterways of the Everglades, the largest subtropical wilderness in the U.S.\n\nHe was working as a financial adviser when then-Gov. Rick Scott appointed him to the board of trustees at a state college, cementing his rise in the state GOP.\n\nHe entered the Florida House in 2016, won a seat in the U.S. House in 2020 and has been on the short list for multiple opportunities ever since, including being nominated in January 2023 by the far-right wing of as a candidate for House speaker.\n\nIn addition to Casey DeSantis, other potential GOP candidates include former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who said in January that he was considering a run, and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, though he recently fought with DeSantis over immigration policies .\n\nBut Trump's endorsement may clear the way for Donalds given his dominance in Republican politics, particularly in his adopted home state. Trump established residency in Palm Beach during his first term.\n\nOne of the state's most high-profile Black Republicans, Donalds would become the first African American to serve as governor if he wins.\n\nDonalds and his wife, Erika Donalds, built a reputation for working to transform public education and direct more taxpayer dollars into private and charter schools. A former county school board member, she runs a company that oversees charter schools and a virtual academy.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis slaps down Canadians with savage hockey joke amid ongoing trade war\n\nBy JAKE FENNER\n\nPublished: 11:06 EDT, 5 March 2025 | Updated: 11:07 EDT, 5 March 2025\n\n47\n\nView comments\n\nAs tensions between the United States and Canada have risen in recent days, prominent supporters of President Donald Trump are taking plenty of opportunities to attack their neighbors to the North.\n\nThe latest attack comes with a jab at the sport that Canada holds closest and dearest to its heart: hockey.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Canada won a very empowering game over the United States in the championship game for the 4 Nations Faceoff - their third win in four games of best-on-best play at an international tournament.\n\nThat win came before Trump officially enacted strong tariffs on Canadian goods. He was also still threatening the nation with annexation as a '51st state'.\n\nWell, those tariffs were officially adopted this week - raising tensions between the two countries to their highest since the War of 1812.\n\nEven though a defeat in international hockey seemingly put the Canadians over the Americans, Florida governor Ron DeSantis decided to remind everyone who currently holds the biggest prize in hockey: the Stanley Cup.\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis joked as Canadians threatened to boycott traveling to his state, saying they may want to see 'what a Stanley Cup winning hockey team actually looks like.'\n\nLast season, the Florida Panthers won the Cup - defeating the Edmonton Oilers in seven games\n\nOf course, Canada just recently humiliated the United States by winning the 4 Nations Faceoff\n\nDeSantis was speaking about tourism to the Sunshine State and pointed out that of the 142million visitors to Florida each year, 3.3million are Canadians.\n\nWhile that number as a whole seems small, it does account for 12 percent of the Canadian population.\n\nHowever, DeSantis still decided to mock threats of a boycott by Canadian travelers by rubbing it in that it's been a while since a team from the 'True North' won hockey's ultimate reward.\n\n'3.3million visitors from Canada. That's not much of a boycott, in my book,' DeSantis said before adding, 'Maybe they wanted to get a glimpse of what a Stanley Cup winning hockey team actually looks like.'\n\nThe Florida Panthers won their first ever Stanley Cup last season, defeating Canada's Edmonton Oilers in seven games.\n\nEdmonton's defeat meant Canada's cup drought continued. No team from the country has won a Stanley Cup since the Montreal Canadiens beat the Wayne Gretzky-led Los Angeles Kings in 1993 - 31 seasons ago.\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, has won four Stanley Cups since 2000. In addition to the Panthers' win last year, the Tampa Bay Lightning won titles in 2004, 2020, and 2021.\n\nWhile teams from the United States just barely have more Stanley Cups combined (55) than Canadian teams (49), the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs are the two teams that have won the prize the most.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Kamala Harris tears into 'utterly irresponsible and selfish' Ron DeSantis for refusing to take her calls during hurricanes\n\nBy KATELYN CARALLE, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. and NIKKI SCHWAB, CHIEF CAMPAIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nPublished: 20:13 EDT, 7 October 2024 | Updated: 22:34 EDT, 7 October 2024\n\n365\n\nView comments\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Monday tore into Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for not taking her calls as another hurricane was barreling toward his state's coastline.\n\nHarris spoke to journalists at Joint Base Andrew as she departed for New York Monday ahead of a series of interviews in the Big Apple.\n\nEarlier Monday reports came out that said DeSantis ignored a call from Harris specifically because he believed the move was politically motivated - as she's the Democratic nominee for president.\n\n'You know, moments of crisis, if nothing else, should really be the moment that anyone who calls themselves a leader says they're gonna put politics aside and put the people first,' Harris said on the tarmac.\n\nShe pointed out that 'people are in desperate need of support right now.'\n\n'And playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations, these are the height of the emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish, and it is about political gamesmanship instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first,' Harris added.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Monday tore into Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for not taking her calls as another hurricane was barreling toward his state's coastline\n\nPresident Joe Biden was in the state last week to survey damage and DeSantis didn't join him.\n\nWhen Biden sought to reach out to DeSantis last week, the governor was flying and unable to take the call, he claimed.\n\nDailyMail.com can confirm that the governor also did not take Harris' call this week.\n\nAnd when Biden was in Florida last week to survey storm damage from Hurricane Helene, DeSantis was already holding a previously scheduled press conference in another part of the state.\n\nThe two did not meet.\n\nWhen asked about not taking the call during a press conference on Monday, DeSantis said that he wasn't even aware that the VP had called him.\n\n'I didn't know she called me. I saw that, but I wasn't aware of that,' he said to reporters in Tallahassee, also claiming that he didn't know the president called either.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis did not take President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris' calls as they reached out regarding Hurricane relief in his state\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'We've gotten approvals for everything we asked for,' he assured.\n\nBiden's Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday: 'It's up to the governor if he wants to respond to us or not.'\n\nAfter the death and destruction of Hurricane Helene, parts of Central and Northern Florida are bracing to be hit by another storm by Wednesday.\n\nWhite not in direct contact with the president or vice president, DeSantis has been speaking with Federal Emergency Management Director Deanne Criswell.\n\nAsked whether politics is affecting hurricane relief response, Jean-Pierre said: 'That's really for the governor to speak to, right?'\n\n'It was his decision...to not attend or not be there with the president,' she added.\n\n'We are doing our part, in the Biden-Harris administration, working - obviously FEMA is work - is on the ground, all hands on deck, whole of government. Robust approach here. And so, again, that's for Gov. DeSantis to speak to.'\n\nA lot of speculation has swirled on the Republican side that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not doing enough to help relieve those dealing with hurricane fallout.\n\nSome theorize that too much money was allocated for housing migrants and illegal immigrants and so none is left for hurricane relief.\n\nOthers are pushing conspiracies that if families accept the aid then the federal government can then take their home, which is leading Americans to not reach out for the help they need.\n\nHurricane Milton is expected to hit landfall by Wednesday as Florida remains in recovery mode from the devastation of Hurricane Helene.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Ron DeSantis listens to Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody during a news conference in Orlando, Fla., Aug. 26, 2021\n\nSome senators have said that Lara Trump would be a good selection for the open seat\n\nFlorida Attorney General Ashely Moody, 49, who was first elected to the position in 2019, will fill the Senate seat, DeSantis said at the press conference Thursday.\n\n'She has stood strong, time and time again,' DeSantis said of the AG, before noting her litigation record.\n\nThe Florida governor noted how Moody 'took on Jack Smith for his politically motivated persecution of the former president' and how she 'fought back against the rogue Attorney General of New York for her politicizing justice.'\n\nShe also 'led the investigation into the second assassination attempt in Palm Beach even as the federal government tries to block her efforts,' DeSantis said.\n\nDuring the press conference the governor touted how his state, which was a swing state just years ago, has defeated wokeism.\n\n'Republicans must fight the woke agenda, and they must defeat the radical left. Florida has fought and won against the woke agenda,' he declared triumphantly.\n\n'We have won time and time again against the political left. And right now, the Democratic Party in this state lies in ruins.'\n\nDeSantis noted how Moody's efforts helped accomplish the Sunshine State's conservative objectives.\n\nFlorida Attorney Generakl Ashley Moody joined Polk Sheriff Grady Judd , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Brevard Sheriff Wayne Ivey to speak on a plan to stop illegal immigration during a press conference at the Sheriff's Operation Center\n\n'I remain incredibly passionate about public service and look forward to serving our country again sometime in the future.

      "text": "Ron DeSantis lashes out at reporter saying it's 'inappropriate' to criticize Gavin Newsom for California fires\n\nBy GEOFF EARLE, DEPUTY U.S. POLITICAL EDITOR\n\nPublished: 14:55 EDT, 10 January 2025 | Updated: 15:35 EDT, 10 January 2025\n\n95\n\nView comments\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis tore into a reporter over the media's lenient coverage of Los Angeles Democrat leaders' handling of the ongoing wildfire disaster.\n\nA reporter asked DeSantis if it was 'inappropriate' to be criticizing California Gov. Gavin Newsom about California water policy as fires incinerated neighborhoods around L.A.\n\nThe governor quickly fired back saying: 'It's inappropriate for people in your industry to try and create division, and to try and create narratives anytime these things happen.'\n\nDeSantis spoke alongside Republican governors at Mar-a-Lago, where they met with Trump who has derided 'Gavin Newscum' for failures amid the fire crisis.\n\n'Now, you're not as interested in doing that because Newsom is a \"D\", DeSantis continued.  'If Newsom was a Republican, you guys would go try to - you would have him nailed to the wall for what they're doing over there.'\n\nDeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and who was briefly floated as a potential defense secretary pick, said it was an unfair contrast to the Surfside building collapse or hurricanes he has contended with during his tenure.\n\nHe said other governors warned him early on that natural disasters would get 'politicized.'\n\n'In fact, when I got elected governor, I was meeting with some of the other Republican governors, and what they would say is, hey, if you have a natural disaster, just know media is coming at you,' he said.\n\nThen DeSantis criticized LA Mayor Karen Bass, a Democratic former House member, for being on a diplomatic delegation to Ghana when the first began ripping across her hometown.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis accused the media of trying to 'try and create division,' and said Republican officials face a double standard. He also attacked Democrats for their handling of the fires tearing through Los Angeles\n\n'It's not the same that mayor of LA if that were a Republican mayor, I could only imagine what that would do. I mean, you know, the fires are at high risk, and you try to go to Africa, or wherever she was, to go on some type of voyage, you should have been there preparing and doing that,' he said.\n\n'And yet, I don't see a lot of heat being directed in that thing. And so, you know, I just, I'd like to see some balance on how this is, this is done. You criticize the point. the President Elect but I think you also have to hold these other people accountable and I have not seen that.'\n\n'You guys sitting in judgement of Donald Trump - excuse me, I think your track record of politicizing these things is very, very bad,' he said.\n\nPresident-elected Donald Trump ridiculed California Gov. Gavin Newsom as 'Newscum' during an angry online post as the fires raged\n\nA staircase is left partially standing in a property in the aftermath of the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, Friday, Jan. 10, 2025\n\nThe question he responded to most likely related to his host Trump, 78, who tore into Newsom over focusing on the delta smelt and other fish in a water dispute, a longtime feature of California politics where farmers and cities battle over precious water resources from the north.\n\nTrump claimed in his initial post that Newsom 'refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way .'\n\nNewsom's office hit back , noting that 'there is no such document,' and calling the claim 'pure fiction.'\n\nNewsom's office did clash with Trump's White House over water use plans, as fact checkers noted.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset . Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions . Legal Statement . Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nRon DeSantis is a Republican politician who currently serves as the 46th governor of Florida. From 2013 to 2018, DeSantis previously served in the House of Representatives for Florida's 6th district. He is widely seen as a major conservative political leader and a possible 2024 Republican presidential contender.\n\nBefore entering politics, DeSantis was a Navy lieutenant, an advisor for SEAL Team One, and was later deployed to Iraq. In 2008, he was appointed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida to serve as a Special Assistant attorney until 2010. DeSantis received his undergraduate degree at Yale and graduated from Harvard Law School.\n\nDuring his tenure in Congress, DeSantis gained a reputation as an ardent defender of President Donald Trump by opposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In 2018, he won the Florida gubernatorial campaign against Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by a thin margin, triggering a recount. DeSantis would go on to win the governorship by a 0.4% margin .\n\nDeSantis's stardom in conservative politics took off partly due to the coronavirus and vaccination policies he implemented in Florida during the pandemic. He prohibited private businesses from enforcing face masks and vaccination requirements. He received praise from conservatives such as Trump but was criticized by those on the left, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. In October 2021, Florida \nrecorded the lowest COVID-19 daily average case per 100,000 residents in the United States, according to the state government.\n\nDeSantis also signed a law prohibiting educational instructors from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to the third grade. Critics of the bill have referred to it as the \"Don't Say, Gay Bill.\" After the bill's passage, Disney admonished the Florida government and vowed to help fight the law in court. As a result, DeSantis stripped \"Walt Disney World\" of its self-governing status in the state.

They seemed to make peace after Trump quickly clinched the nomination during the primaries, and DeSantis helped raise funds for Trump during the general election.\n\nAfter Donalds jumped into the race, DeSantis seemed to criticize the congressman, saying at a news conference that \"I think people look at it and say you've got a guy like Byron, he just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left over these last years.\"\n\nSince he made those comments, the governor has refrained from criticizing Donalds, but has repeatedly touted his wife's accomplishments as Florida first lady and framing her as a worthy successor.\n\nFlorida Governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis walks alongside his wife, Casey DeSantis, and son, Mason, while marching in the Wolfeboro Independence Day Parade in New Hampshire on Tuesday, July 4, 2023. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News Digital)\n\nCasey DeSantis last week stoked speculation when asked by reporters if she would run.\n\n\"To quote the late Yogi Berra,\" DeSantis said as she reiterated a famous line from the late baseball legend. \"If you see a fork in the road, take it.\"\n\nThe governor then quipped to reporters that \"you guys can read into that what you will.\"\n\nFox News last week also confirmed that Gov. DeSantis was reaching out to donors on behalf of his wife.\n\nAsked about Casey DeSantis, Donald told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo this past weekend that \"I remember back in 2018 campaigning for then-Congressman DeSantis, who had the support of Donald Trump, and that worked out great for our state. So, in 2025, moving into 2026, I am really honored to have the same support from President Trump.\"\n\n\"He has a history of making good picks, and I think his picks have always worked out for the Sunshine State,\" Donald emphasized.\n\nAnd he added that \"we will worry about the primaries as other people decide to get in the race or not, but we are going to be focused on Floridians.\"\n\nWhile Florida was once a top general election battleground, it's now firmly red - DeSantis won re-election in 2022 by nearly 20 points and Trump carried the state in November by 13 points - and the eventual winner of the GOP primary will be considered the front-runner in next year's gubernatorial election.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "'Openly Fascist': MSNBC Host Rages At Ron DeSantis After Florida Abortion Amendment Fails\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid raged at Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida Tuesday night after a ballot measure to loosen restrictions on abortion failed to pass.\n\nFlorida's law restricting abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy remains in force after Amendment 4 failed to reach the 60% threshold to be adopted as an amendment to the Florida constitution. Reid called DeSantis' campaigning against the ballot measure \"openly fascist.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"He's put everything on it, including threats, whatever it takes to try to make sure that that amendment fails using the power of government in a way that is, I would say, openly fascist and very determined,\" Reid said. \"Because, of course, this is something he wants to be his signature thing. It's the thing he passed thinking that it would allow him to defeat Donald Trump and move to his right can and make him a national star and potentially the heir to Donald Trump in the party.\"\n\nDeSantis signed legislation restricting abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, in April 2023, months after Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 after upholding a Mississippi law in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, returning the issue to the states to decide.\n\nAbortion was a top issue for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections following the high court's decision. During those elections, Republicans underperformed expectations of a \"red wave\" nationally, although DeSantis defeated former Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, who served as governor from 2007-2011 as a Republican, by over 19% in the Florida gubernatorial race.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Ron DeSantis (R) as a potential replacement, citing people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWhile the discussions are in the early stages, a source told the outlet, Trump has tossed around DeSantis' name casually. The sources added that Trump could also not choose DeSantis, if Hegseth's nomination falls apart.\n\nAnother name that has reportedly been considered among Trump allies is former Pentagon official Elbridge Colby, and Trump is reportedly considering Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa).\n\nThis comes amid mounting allegations against Hegseth, who served in the U.S. Army, and concerns from Republican lawmakers.\n\nAs the outlet pointed out, DeSantis \"shares Trump's-and Hegseth's-view on culling what they see as 'woke' policies in the military.\"\n\nDeSantis has served as a U.S. Navy lawyer in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nPer WSJ: \"Republican senators who have begun meeting with Hegseth have warned him that he would face a grilling during public confirmation hearings, and they have openly said he would need to work to overcome sexual assault and other allegations. A person familiar with the matter said there were six senators who were potentially opposed to his nomination. So far, no Republican senators have publicly said they would oppose Hegseth's nomination, and Trump still publicly backs him.\"\n\nIJR, Editor-in-Chief\r\nShe's been with Independent Journal Review since 2018.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Vanity Fair Article Insists a DeSantis Presidency Would Be 'As Terrifying as a Trump One'\n\n(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIf you're looking for an alternative to former President Donald Trump , Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) would be just as \"terrifying,\" according to an article published by Vanity Fair.\n\nAn article published by Vanity Fair on Monday aims to be a \"comprehensive guide\" explaining why a DeSantis presidency would be \"terrifying.\"\n\nThe magazine's Bess Levin notes the Florida governor has not shared whether he plans to run for president in 2024, but, \"That prospect is exciting to a number of people-namely, his record-setting pack of billionaire donors.\"\n\n\"As it turns out, having the support of, say, Elon Musk does not mean someone should be president. In fact, it's probably a good indication someone definitely should not be president, and when it comes to DeSantis, that is most certainly the case,\" she insisted.\n\nLevin added, \"To be clear, this is not an argument in favor of giving Trump...Rather, it's an argument that DeSantis-who some recent polls show thrashing Trump in a theoretical GOP primary-would be no better and it would be great if people could avoid giving him the top job in Washington, too.\"\n\nRon DeSantis' bigoted policies and authoritarian behavior make him an equally bad pick for the job. Read the latest from @besslevin : https://t.co/gkpTyqAXd8 - VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) January 3, 2023\n\nRon DeSantis' bigoted policies and authoritarian behavior make him an equally bad pick for the job. Read the latest from @besslevin : https://t.co/gkpTyqAXd8\n\nThe article listed 13 reasons why a President DeSantis would be \"terrifying.\"\n\nThe first item alleges he \"thinks it's okay to treat human beings like chattel,\" as it notes his decision to fly migrants to other states earlier this year.\n\n\"It was absolutely stomach-churning, and it's presumably the kind of stunt DeSantis would look forward to regularly engaging in on a mass scale as president,\" Levin wrote.\n\nThe article also insists DeSantis is \"dangerously anti-science\" as it takes issue with his response to COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, Levin claims the governor is \"anti-free speech, particularly the kind of free speech that says the United States hasn't always been great for non-white people.\"\n\nSpecifically, she highlighted the Stop WOKE Act. The Washington Post notes , \"The Florida law deems it discrimination if a student was exposed to anything that compelled them to believe 'he or she must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress for actions, in which he or she played no part, committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.'\"\n\nShe also claimed DeSantis is \"waging a war on trans people\" because the Florida Board of Medicine and the state Board of Osteopathic Medicine prohibited minors from receiving gender-affirming care - reportedly at his urging.\n\nAdditionally, Levin noted Florida's Parental Rights in Education law - which has been dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay - law, and his decision to sign a bill banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFinally, the article claimed DeSantis is \"an awful person and has been for many years.\"\n\nLevin highlighted a quote a former college teammate gave to The New Yorker.\n\n\"Ron is the most selfish person I have ever interacted with. He has always loved embarrassing and humiliating people. I'm speaking for others-he was the biggest dick we knew,\" the teammate said.\n\nThe teammate added, \"He has always loved embarrassing and humiliating people.\"\n\nIJR, Senior Writer\r\nHe's written for Independent Journal Review since 2019.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

I want these congressmen focused on enacting his agenda. They haven't done very much yet,\" DeSantis told reporters when asked whether he planned to endorse Donalds (R-Fla.).\n\n\"They're not putting his executive orders into place. We'll see what they do on the spending, but we have such a narrow majority that to be trying to campaign other places and missing these votes, I think, is not something that's advisable at all,\" he continued.\n\n\"The reality is we've achieved victories in Florida. We need to start achieving those victories up there,\" he said. \"I think people look at it and say you've got a guy like Byron, he just hasn't been a part of any of the victories that we've had here over the left over these last years. He's just not been a part of it. He's been in other states campaigning doing that and that's fine, but OK, then deliver results up there.\"\n\nInstead, DeSantis talked up the possibility of his wife, Casey DeSantis, taking a run at the gubernatorial position.\n\n\"I won by the biggest margin that any Republican has ever won a governor's race here in Florida. She would do better than me,\" DeSantis said in Tampa. \"She's somebody that has the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles that you know anything that we've accomplished she'd be able to take to the next level.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump was supportive last week for Donalds to succeed the term-limited DeSantis.\n\n\"I am hearing that Highly Respected Congressman Byron Donalds is considering running for Governor of Florida, a State that I love, and WON BIG in 2016, 2020, and 2024,\" Trump, who is a Florida resident, wrote  on Thursday.\n\nThe 47 th president emphasized that Donalds, a longtime Trump ally, \"would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida.\"\n\nTrump added that should Donalds decide to run, he \"will have my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, BYRON, RUN!\"\n\nReports have also suggested that Donalds has been seeking a potential gubernatorial bid for almost a year.\n\n\"I've thought about it. I don't really rule anything out,\" Donalds said in a Fox News Digital interview last spring when asked about a possible run for governor.\n\nDeSantis and Donalds had their falling out during the 2024 Republican presidential primary when Donalds endorsed President Trump over DeSantis. As DeSantis and Trump have begun to rekindle their relationship after their primary battle, Donalds has continued to support Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Donalds responded to Trump's post on social media, saying on X: \"President Trump is Making America Great Again. I'm committed to working with him to Keep Florida Great. Announcement coming soon!\"\n\nPresident Trump is Making America Great Again. I'm committed to working with him to Keep Florida Great. Announcement coming soon! pic.twitter.com/Bimj712vIL\n\nAdditionally, some reports have suggested that the Florida congressman had been pushing for a Trump endorsement - in an effort to weed out other potential rivals.\n\nOn Monday, Trump displayed a screen grab of a poll conducted by a group aligned with Donalds, which indicated that the congressman would be leading in a hypothetical 2026 Florida gubernatorial matchup.\n\nDonalds, while speaking with Fox News soon after Trump made the comments, said: \"it's really cool that people back home in Florida consider me to be able to be the state's next governor. It's really an honor. It's honestly surreal thinking about it because I'm 45 and my journey through politics has been a really fruitful one.\"\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "Taking On Disney, Fauci, and the Media: The Secrets of Ron's Success\n\n\"Most Americans instinctively know that something has gone wrong with our country over the past generation.\"\n\nThat's how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R.) opens his new book, The Courage to Be Free . He identifies the malefactors as a collection of elites who have \"alienated vast swaths of Americans,\" a Democratic Party that has \"transformed into what can only be described as a woke dumpster fire,\" and a bipartisan D.C. establishment riddled with inaction and ineptitude that has left many Republican voters feeling \"unrepresented by the GOP.\"\n\nThis is, in case there were any illusions, a campaign book. It allows DeSantis to introduce himself to readers and make the case for himself as a presidential contender.\n\nDeSantis grew up in the Tampa Bay area, his childhood shaped by youth baseball and the cultural values of his \"blue-collar, working-class\" parents, who hailed from western Pennsylvania and northwest Ohio.\n\nFor DeSantis, baseball was his gateway to the wider world, \"the engine that expanded my horizons.\" A turning point in his childhood, he writes, was the realization that his team could make it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., where they would face off against a team from Taiwan.\n\nBaseball was also the engine of DeSantis's advancement in another way: His performance put him on the recruitment map for Ivy League schools, and DeSantis recounts his journey from Yale University to Harvard Law School, and from the U.S. Navy into the political arena.\n\nYale was a culture shock. DeSantis says students were \"led to believe that communism was superior,\" while at Harvard Law School, faculty \"sought to manipulate the law to achieve their preferred political outcomes.\"\n\nThose who have read about the influence of DeSantis's wife Casey in his political operation won't be surprised to read his description of how they met-hitting golf balls, something he describes as \"my life's most fortuitous moment.\" She is the star of the book's acknowledgments, where DeSantis writes that he \"would not have had much of a story to tell in the first place without her support, as I would not have had nearly as much success in my career, especially as governor.\"\n\nThis is about as personal and emotional as it gets, however, with many details other politicians would include notably missing. We don't learn the names of DeSantis's parents, for example, or hear about the tragic and sudden death of his younger sister Christina in 2015.\n\nHere, the 44-year-old Florida governor previews some of the arguments we can expect to see on the campaign trail. He makes a tacit case for a governor as president, arguing that \"legislators play an important role in our system, but they are not really required to lead-they cast votes that reflect their philosophies, but the buck does not stop with them.\"\n\nA governor, by contrast, \"must have a strong sense of true north to guide him, but that sense must be coupled with the ability and willingness to lead with conviction.\"\n\nBut DeSantis doesn't take his potential 2024 GOP rivals head on-unlike, say, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who savaged former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and took on former president Donald Trump in his own campaign book published earlier this year.\n\nThose hoping for gossip about Trump-particularly given the escalation of tensions between the two camps in recent weeks-will be left wanting.\n\nIn fact, DeSantis presents himself as a rare ally of Trump during his time in Congress, condemning the rejection of early treatments to combat COVID-19 as a \"clinical case of Trump Derangement Syndrome\" and noting his vocal support for Trump's decision to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.\n\nThe only veiled criticisms of the former president come in the contrast he draws with his own leadership. DeSantis writes that he has \"no desire to be flattered\" and that his \"office could not run effectively if it had habitual leaking of information.\" He expresses frustration \"with all the missed opportunities of the Republican Congress after Donald Trump became president.\"\n\nDeSantis's own political origin story dates back to 2012, where he describes campaigning as an underdog, arguing that his victory as a political unknown hinged on the hours spent campaigning door-to-door learning about \"the concerns of voters in an unfiltered way.\"\n\nThis is a theme, an explanation of his own strength and a criticism of his opponents' weaknesses. \"Republican messaging failures have been rooted less in messaging techniques than in failing to advocate policies that address the concerns of the voters,\" DeSantis argues. Immigration, he says, is a case in point.\n\n\"Of all the issues on which GOP leaders had ignored their voters, on no issue did they do so more consistently and more flagrantly than on the issue of immigration,\" DeSantis writes, condemning \"Beltway Republicans\" who have supported immigration reform in the service of \"corporate interests.\"\n\nDeSantis is also not afraid to appear too modest. He describes the 2018 race in which he was elected governor of Florida as \"the most consequential election in the history of our state,\" adding that Florida has engaged in every important political and cultural battle in recent years, from critical race theory to the \"defund the police\" movement-and won.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Florida governor also tears into the legacy media, decrying their use of a deceptive strategy to elevate their political agenda: \"Smear first, ask questions later, and the consequences be damned.\" He includes the full exchange of a now-infamous interview with CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, part of which aired on 60 Minutes .\n\nThe story alleged DeSantis had conspired with grocery chain Publix to grant them \"exclusive rights\" to distribute COVID-19 shots, \"citing a Publix donation of $100,000\" to DeSantis's political action committee. However, the majority of DeSantis's comments are marked in bold. Why? That's the relevant part 60 Minutes selectively edited out .\n\nWith The Courage to Be Free , DeSantis presents the American people with his political résumé. His self-defined blueprint for success explores his rejection of Dr. Anthony Fauci and COVID-19 authoritarians, his battle with Disney and the woke assault on education, and his policy-focused resistance to the left's own \"Praetorian Guard,\" the legacy media.\n\nA common theme throughout the book is one of tipping points-whether political or even personal, such as DeSantis leaving a congressional baseball practice early, unwittingly escaping the mass shooting that occurred just moments later.\n\nJust one question remains: Will 2024 prove to be another tipping point for the underdog from Jacksonville, Florida?\n\nThe Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival by Ron DeSantis Broadside Books, 288 pp., $35\n\nIan Haworth is a writer, speaker, and former Big Tech insider.

A boat carrying 25 Haitians was recently stopped by Florida Fish and Wildlife officers. Guns, drugs, and night vision gear were also discovered aboard.\n\nDeSantis in September 2022 sent two planes of roughly 50 Venezuelan migrants to Martha's Vineyard. A day after the migrants arrived, they were ferried off the island and escorted by National Guard troops to a military base on mainland Massachusetts. President Joe Biden condemned DeSantis's move as a \"political stunt.\"\n\nFlorida Republicans have pressured the Biden administration as the crisis in Haiti has escalated, with four GOP representatives writing a letter asking the president to authorize the Navy to conduct maritime interdictions of migrant vessels.\n\nPublished under: Florida , Haiti , Illegal Immigration\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

The Florida governor reopened businesses and schools earlier than most other states and resisted pressure from Fauci and others to impose vaccine and mask mandates.\n\n\"In Florida, we led the country out of lockdown,\" said DeSantis. \"We kept our state free and open and let me tell you this, as your president, I will never let the deep state bureaucrats lock you down.\"\n\nDeSantis has taken aim before at Fauci, who retired last year.

      "text": "A Pathetic Ron DeSantis Hit Piece\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Atlantic published an article criticizing Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who cruised to reelection by almost 20 percentage points and is widely expected to challenge former president Donald Trump for the Republican nomination in 2024.\n\nWhat did it say?\n\nThe headline reads: \"Just Wait Until You Get to Know Ron DeSantis.\" Staff writer Mark Leibovich reports that \"people who have met\" the governor or \"have watched him longer\" than others are skeptical of his ability to succeed on a national stage.\n\nWho are these people?\n\n• A former two-term GOP congresswoman from the Washington, D.C., suburbs who said DeSantis was \"standoffish in general.\"\n\n• Rick Wilson, the former Republican strategist and Lincoln Project co-founder who spends his days boasting about sleeping with other people's wives on Twitter. He has a clear financial interest in helping Donald Trump win the GOP nomination. He is incorrectly identified as a \"Republican media consultant.\" That's like describing Edward Snowden as an NSA employee.\n\n• Mac Stipanovich, a \"Tallahassee lobbyist who set sail from the GOP over his revulsion for Trump and his knockoffs.\" He registered as a Democrat in 2019 and expressed support for Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg in the presidential primary.\n\n• Carlos Curbelo, a former two-term GOP congressman from Florida, who said DeSantis would face \"some challenges\" in the 2024 primary, such as finding a way to \"humanize himself\" in front of a national audience. \"Everything else checks the box. He is smart and competent and committed to his ideology.\"\n\nThat's it?\n\nThat's it.\n\nSeriously?\n\nYes.\n\nRick Wilson?\n\nI know. He called it a \"great piece.\"\n\nWhat's the bottom line?\n\nDeSantis may or may not have what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. To win on the national stage, he will need to overcome an army of antagonists who don't even like Trump but are professionally and emotionally invested in Trump's success. This includes every mainstream media outlet whose ratings and profits tanked after Joe Biden was sworn in as president, as well as every Democratic politician and consultant who wants to run against Trump in 2024. Grifters like Rick Wilson, too.\n\nTrump is an existential threat to democracy, they argue, but he must prevail. DeSantis could stop that from happening, so he must be destroyed.\n\nPublished under: Florida , Republican Party , Ron DeSantis\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "'Great American Comeback': DeSantis Launches Presidential Bid, Pledges To Restore 'Sanity to Our Society'\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis formally launched his presidential bid Wednesday night, with the Republican pledging to restore \"sanity to our society\" and lead a \"great American comeback.\"\n\nDeSantis's message came in part through a one-minute launch video , during which the Florida governor hammered President Joe Biden for mishandling the southern border, crime, and the economy. That video's release preceded a virtual conversation between DeSantis and billionaire Twitter CEO Elon Musk, though technical issues plagued the conversation's start. Once the roughly hour-long discussion got under way, DeSantis highlighted his legislative accomplishments in Florida as a blueprint to replicate nationwide, and defended himself on hot-button issues such as his battle with Disney.\n\nDeSantis enters the race as former president Donald Trump's most formidable primary challenger. He is the only Republican presidential hopeful besides Trump who has routinely polled in the double-digits, a position that has brought attacks from both Trump and his allies-who have already spent millions on negative advertising against him and begun trashing his wife, Casey-and other GOP primary candidates such as former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who says he has no charm.\n\nWhile DeSantis largely refrained from responding to those attacks-the Florida governor in November called the intra-party criticism \"just noise\" and months later said he's \"just not following it\"-he used his formal announcement to say publicly some of what he has told allies privately over the past few months. DeSantis during his conversation with Musk called to \"end the culture of losing that has infected the Republican Party in recent years,\" a line that came roughly one week after DeSantis told donors that Trump would not be able to win the general election come 2024.\n\nDeSantis's decision to launch his campaign through an unorthodox online conversation with Musk, who has become a popular figure on the right, reflects the Republican's media strategy. The Florida governor has spurned legacy media outlets in favor of conservative alternatives, though it was unclear whether he would continue to do so as a presidential candidate. Wednesday evening's announcement, however, is followed by an interview on Fox News and a press call that appears to be limited to conservative media outlets, an indication DeSantis has no plans to change course.\n\nAfter roughly 20 minutes of unreliable audio on Wednesday night, Musk ended the discussion, which he held through Twitter's live audio platform, before restarting it around 6:30 p.m. \"It seems we broke the internet with so much excitement,\" DeSantis's campaign tweeted .\n\nThe Florida governor emerged as a GOP star during his first term in office by rejecting COVID-era lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and school mask requirements, policies the Republican said made Florida the \"freest state\" in America. He cruised to reelection last November, defeating his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, by a whopping 19 points-the largest margin of victory for any Florida governor in four decades in a year in which Republicans nationwide underperformed expectations.\n\n\"My view was I had to look out for the people I represented, for protecting their jobs over trying to safeguard my political hide,\" DeSantis said Wednesday night. \"There was an official narrative about lockdowns, about closing schools, about forced masking, about all these different things that we had to navigate during COVID.\"\n\nBeyond his COVID policies, DeSantis has shown an eagerness to wade into-and often popularize-cultural fights.\n\nLast year, for example, the Republican signed legislation that prohibited public schools from providing \"classroom instruction\" on \"sexual orientation or gender identity\" from kindergarten through third grade. While mainstream media outlets and national Democrats quickly lambasted what they called the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill as \"hateful\" and \"ugly,\" everyday voters disagreed. Americans who were presented with the legislation's actual language backed it by a two-to-one margin , according to a 2022 Public Opinion Strategies poll. Nearly 80 percent of U.S. adults, meanwhile, believe it's \"inappropriate\" for teachers to discuss \"trans identity\" with students in kindergarten to third grade, a May Washington Post poll found .\n\n\"Our mantra in Florida is that the purpose of the schools is education, not indoctrination,\" DeSantis said during his conversation with Musk.\n\nIn addition to his Fox News interview and press call, DeSantis will hold a tele-townhall with a national slate of voters before meeting  in the coming days with top campaign donors at a Miami retreat. After the Memorial Day holiday, the Florida governor plans to hold events across several early primary states, according to NBC News.\n\nPublished under: Donald Trump , Feature , Florida , Ron DeSantis\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "In Los Angeles Speech, DeSantis Warns America Must Choose Between California and Florida\n\nSIMI VALLEY, CALIF.-Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis railed against California's progressive policies in a Sunday speech that offered a glimpse into the Republican's likely 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nSpeaking to a sold-out house at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, DeSantis lamented that California Democrats had driven people from the state with their progressive policies. The governor in particular blamed high taxes, public school \"indoctrination,\" and soft-on-crime prosecutors for driving half a million people out of the state over the past two years.\n\n\"From the beginning of this state's history, all the way until like the last four or five years, people beat a path to California. You didn't beat a path away from California,\" DeSantis said. \"Now you see the state hemorrhaging population.\"\n\nThe speech was the latest stop on DeSantis's book tour, which is widely viewed as a pre-campaign trek. If he chooses to run, DeSantis will join a Republican field that already counts former president Donald Trump, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , and \"anti-woke\" Silicon Valley entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy . A February poll of California voters showed DeSantis soundly beating Trump among Republicans.\n\nSunday's event brought an array of donors, library members, and the curious public, including actor Gary Sinise and former Republican California governor Pete Wilson, who told the Washington Free Beacon that DeSantis's speech was \"magnificent.\"\n\nWilson would not say whom he would endorse in 2024, noting that \"we're confronting the problem of having too much talent.\" But, he added, \"the nice thing is that everything [DeSantis] said is true, and he has done all the things that he has talked about.\"\n\nWhile many of his lines drew loud applause, DeSantis got a standing ovation when he declared that schools \"should not be teaching a second-grader that they can choose their gender\"-a perceived reference to California public schools' forays into radical gender ideology.\n\n\"In Florida we say very clearly we will never ever surrender to the woke mob,\" he said. \"Our state is where woke goes to die.\"\n\nNor did he apologize for his blunt governing style, describing how, when he first won the governorship in 2018 by half a percentage point, some advisers warned him \"to not rock the boat.\"\n\n\"I rejected that advice,\" he said. \"My view was that I may have earned 50 percent of the vote, but I earned 100 percent of the executive power, and I intended to use it to advance the best interests of Florida.\"\n\nIn a thinly veiled jab at Trump, DeSantis boasted that he governed with \"surgical precision\" and avoided \"drama or palace intrigue.\"\n\n\"Because we did that, we beat the left, day after day after day,\" he said.\n\nAudience members on Sunday told the Free Beacon they turned out for DeSantis because they want to see an alternative to Trump.\n\n\"Most of my friends are avid Ron DeSantis fans,\" said Michele Fisher, a Los Angeles resident who described herself as a moderate, pro-choice, and \"not too political\" Republican who is trying to gauge which candidate she can see herself voting for. \"Anyone running against Trump has to be a positive.\"\n\nAnother Southern California resident, Joyce Wiechert, said she voted for Trump in the past but this time plans to support someone else and is interested in both DeSantis and Haley.\n\nDeSantis noticeably pulled his punches when it came to California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D.), who has run a proxy campaign against DeSantis for months, paying to run critical ads on Twitter, Facebook, and Florida billboards. While DeSantis stuck mostly to a broad discussion of California's politics, he did have one thing to say for his West Coast foil.\n\n\"Your governor is very concerned about what we're doing in Florida,\" DeSantis joked at the beginning of the speech, \"so I figured I had to come by.\"\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , California , Donald Trump , Florida , Gavin Newsom , GOP Primary , Ron DeSantis , woke\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
